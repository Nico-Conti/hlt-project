me011|and we're on.|S
me011|so uh|F
mn014|time?|Q
mn014|fourteen whatever.|S
me011|so topic number one is we got the n s f a t r.|S
me011|i t r.|S
me011|excuse me.|S
me011|which was originally pretty big but it's divided among many sites.|D
me011|and they like cut the budget by a by two thirds.|S
me011|so they they approved it for all the sites.|S
me011|but only gave us like sixty two percent of the money.|S
me011|or excuse me cut it by sixty two percent.|S
mn014|thirty two.|S
mn014|yeah thirty whatever.|S
me011|so uh morgan is uh|D
me011|and the other condition is that they have to get a budget out like immediately.|S
me011|or or they'll give the money to someone else.|S
me018|by next friday.|S
me011|so morgan's working on that.|S
me001|uhhuh.|B
me011|so i mean it's good news.|S
me011|it's not as good as it could have been.|S
me011|but it was uh|D
me018|it's more money.|S
me011|the the i t rs are you know a a long shot and so it's it's really nice that we got that.|S
me001|what does that stand for?|Q
me011|information technology research.|S
me011|something like that.|S
me018|something like that.|S
me051|huh.|B
me001|all right.|S
me011|it's uh|D
mn014|doesn't say much.|S
me001|yeah it's pretty vague.|S
me018|it's it's um it's some money that we can use|D
me001|it's government run i guess.|S
me018|uh i mean we're in conjunction with uh s r i washington and um columbia.|S
me001|uhhuh.|B
me001|okay.|B
me018|and to do research on the meetings.|S
me001|cool.|B
me011|yeah it was specifically on the meeting.|S
mn014|not great.|S
me011|so was that the one that was the meeting maps?|Q
me018|yeah.|S
me011|okay good.|S
me011|i liked that one.|S
me018|yeah.|B
mn014|what is meeting maps?|Q
me018|mapping meetings or|D
me011|well the the sort of general idea was you can think about meetings at lots of different levels.|S
me011|all the way from all the way down to acoustics to all the way up to dialogue discourse topic.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
mn014|yeah.|B
mn014|yeah.|B
me011|and so this this was how do you map all that information onto that?|Q
me011|onto the meeting domain.|S
me018|it's like creating a a map of a meeting in a sense.|S
me011|so that the the analogy was you have maps of different things at different resolutions.|S
me011|and so uh|F
mn014|uh okay.|S
me011|so this had a lot of different stuff in it.|S
mn014|okay.|S
me018|it actually doesn't have a whole lot of speech stuff to it.|S
mn014|yeah sure.|S
mn014|yeah that's|D
me011|it's mostly higher level.|S
me018|it's|D
mn014|yeah.|B
me018|higher level yeah.|S
me011|yeah.|B
mn014|yeah.|B
me011|but nonetheless i think if we|D
me011|it's a it's a cool idea.|S
me011|and if we can actually get it get it going that would be neat.|S
me011|so and uh this was the one also that was|D
me011|uh|F
me011|was it with susan ervin tripp?|Q
me018|i don't remember.|S
me018|it might have been|D
me018|yeah we had to get some|D
mn014|with who?|Q
me011|she's a linguist on campus.|S
mn014|okay.|S
me011|anyway.|S
me011|so other topics i wanted to talk about are um the darpa demo which i guess since morgan isn't here we can't really talk about.|S
me011|i just wanted to make sure it was ready to go.|S
me001|yeah.|B
me011|uh but i guess|D
me001|i sent|D
me011|your stuff is all ready.|S
me011|so it's just a question of did morgan get around to testing it?|Q
me001|yeah and i sent you an email|D
me011|yeah i got it with the instructions.|S
me001|with the instructions.|S
me001|i don't know.|S
me001|so morgan|D
me001|i guess morgan's leaving on saturday?|Q
me011|yep.|S
me001|so until then|D
me001|i guess we might hear something.|S
me011|yeah so i guess we we had better be on call for a little while.|S
me001|but|D
me001|yeah exactly.|S
me018|did he ever figure out how to switch between applications like he was wanting to do?|Q
me011|i don't know.|S
me011|i haven't spoken with him.|S
me001|yeah.|S
me018|he did?|Q
me001|yeah.|S
mn014|switch between applications?|Q
me018|how is he going to do it?|Q
me011|alt tab.|S
me001|it's just alt tab.|S
me001|like if you hold down alt and then tap tab you just the just the task manager window comes up.|S
me018|yeah yeah he|D
mn014|yes that's|D
me011|i i think|D
me018|he|D
me018|right.|B
me011|i think the problem was that i was saying hit alt tab with the assumption that he knew what i meant.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me011|but he didn't.|S
me011|so|F
me018|no he said he tried that but he didn't like it because it|D
me001|well|D
me018|uh|F
me018|it took it out of the um|D
me011|but it doesn't.|S
me018|presentation mode.|S
me011|it doesn't.|S
me001|well because if you just touch alt|D
me001|if you just hit it once it'll go back to the previous application.|S
me001|and the previous application was the powerpoint demo.|S
me001|which was the display of like you know|D
me018|oh!|S
me011|and and all i said was oh just cycle through with alt tab.|S
me001|not the slide show.|S
me011|because that's the standard way of doing it in windows.|S
me001|yeah he didn't|D
me011|but of course he doesn't use windows.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me001|right.|B
me011|so|F
me011|he didn't know what i meant.|S
me018|oh so what do you have to do?|S
me051|huh.|B
me018|you have alt tab and|D
me011|hold down at hold down alt.|S
me011|and then tap tab several times.|S
me011|and you'll cycle through all the open applications.|S
me001|yeah.|B
mn014|yeah.|B
me018|uh okay and then it won't|D
me018|and then you can come back to your full screen version of your|D
me011|right.|S
me001|right.|B
mn014|yeah.|B
me018|oh!|S
me001|and i told them um if he decides to use multiple examples for um the prosody demo to open up separate transcribers.|S
me001|just so you don't have to load up files during the meeting.|S
me011|that's a good idea.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me001|so|F
mn014|yeah.|B
me011|that's not a bad idea at all.|S
me011|so that uh|D
me001|he's got the memory for it.|S
me001|so|F
me011|yeah and since the files are short it's just|D
me001|yeah they're all really short.|S
me011|i mean the tcl t k overhead is pretty high.|S
me011|but it shouldn't matter.|S
me018|how much memory does he have?|Q
me001|no i didn't have any problems.|S
me001|i'm sorry?|Q
me018|how much memory does he have?|Q
me001|i don't know.|S
me001|but it seemed it didn't seem to be a problem at all.|S
me001|i would imagine you add sixty four to a hundred and twenty eight.|S
me018|huh.|B
me011|i think he had one twenty eight.|S
me001|yeah either one will work i think.|S
me011|uh|F
me011|but|D
me011|it was faster than my p c.|S
me001|i mean it was|D
me018|huh.|B
me011|so|F
me018|wow!|S
me001|yeah it was fine i think|D
me001|yeah i mean i i i we kind of walked through it a little bit on his on his laptop.|S
me018|so are we the only ones who are giving demo or is uh washington going to have a demo too?|Q
me001|i could.|S
me011|i assume but they're all doing communicator stuff.|S
me018|or|D
me018|oh okay.|S
me011|so|F
me018|huh.|B
me001|and it's part of the talk itself.|S
me001|so it's really not a big part.|S
me018|yeah i see.|S
me011|i mean the talk's only twenty minutes.|S
me001|it's just going to be a couple of|D
me011|so you know all this time we spent on it's going to be thirty seconds of screen time.|S
me001|i know.|B
me018|oh my gosh.|S
me001|right uhhuh|B
me018|oh!|S
me001|but it's a good tool to have.|S
me011|yeah|D
me001|the the the meeting i r stuff is actually|D
me011|actually both of them.|S
me011|you know because we're going to want to be playing with the|D
me001|uhhuh.|S
me011|uh|F
me011|help my brain.|S
me011|with the uh|D
me001|prosody?|Q
me011|prosody stuff anyway.|S
me011|um so actually at some point we should talk to users of that technology who are actually going to be using it.|S
me011|and see what they would like to see.|S
me001|yeah have you guys seen the display?|Q
me001|have you guys seen either of the demos?|Q
me001|they're pretty cool.|S
me018|no.|S
mn014|nope.|S
me001|like the prosody demo we basically loaded up um word alignments.|S
me001|so instead of having um utterances in the bottom it's like just word by word.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
me001|so you can see exactly where the overlaps are.|S
me018|oh.|B
me001|and then um adam did something where um we converted these feature files into wave files.|S
me001|so you can display them.|D
me018|display the features.|S
mn014|instead of the wave file?|Q
me001|yeah instead of the wave file.|S
mn014|oh okay.|S
me001|and then using multi wave you can add a file and play that sound.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
me001|play the audio corresponding to that um um feature file.|S
mn014|okay.|B
me001|and it's all like aligned and stuff.|S
mn014|uh great.|S
me018|so you see like the f zero contour?|Q
me001|yeah so you see the pitch contours.|S
me001|and you and when you hit play like there's a line that goes through it.|S
me001|you know and it's all aligned with like the the audio and the feature file.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
mn014|oh that's great.|S
me011|audio.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me011|and the stylized f naught features are pretty cool.|S
me018|huh.|B
me001|yeah.|S
me011|so these does a piece wise linear.|S
me011|and so normally if you look at an f naught track it jumps all over the place.|S
me018|yeah.|B
mn014|yeah.|B
me011|this is a nice smooth one.|S
me018|oh neat.|S
me011|and it really does a good job.|S
mn014|and there's something like a median filter in it or something?|Q
mn014|and uh and it's it's a linear fit or whatever.|S
me001|yeah there's a|D
me011|it's a combination.|S
me001|yeah.|B
me001|there's a median filtering and then there's a piece wise linear fit based on some criteria.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
mn014|yeah.|B
me001|i'm not sure.|S
mn014|okay.|S
me011|uh|D
me011|actually could you email me a reference to that paper if you have it?|Q
me001|yeah sure.|S
me011|because i'm sort of curious how what criteria it has.|S
me001|i should email morgan about it too.|S
me001|because he was asking about that.|S
me001|and yeah.|F
me011|i mean so there's obviously a trade off between the number of knots you pick and the best fit.|S
me011|i mean so if you're doing a piece wise linear you have to figure out how many pieces you want.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
mn014|yeah sure.|S
me011|and so there's a trade off.|S
me011|because the best the best mean squared fit would be with an infinite number of knots.|S
me001|right well then it's not a linear fit.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
mn014|yeah yeah.|S
me001|you're not fitting anything then.|S
me011|well sure it is.|S
me011|but|D
me001|well|F
mn014|yeah.|B
me011|so so you there's a trade off.|S
me001|yeah it|D
me001|it's kind of a useless one.|S
me011|and i'm wondering what criteria they use.|S
me001|yeah i actually don't know off the top of my head.|S
me011|uhhuh.|D
me018|was this code that you downloaded to do this?|Q
me018|or was it|D
me001|this was um kemal sonmez at s r i.|S
me001|who's a co worker with uh liz.|S
me018|huh.|B
me011|dot com.|S
me018|at s r i dot com?|Q
me001|yeah did i just|D
me011|no i you said at s r i.|S
me018|no|D
me011|so i had to add the dot com.|S
me018|it sounded like a u r l the way you were saying it.|S
me001|oh oh.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me001|sorry.|S
me001|um yeah but so kamal has uh|D
me001|he did a paper on this for some speech verification uh project.|S
me001|and we basically extrapolated what he what he did for that work and applied it to our files.|S
me001|and that's how we do that's how we get our feature files and everything for all the prosody.|S
me018|so what i mean is like the implementation that you used was something that you coded up here?|Q
me018|or you grabbed code from somewhere else?|Q
me001|that|D
me001|no we grabbed most of it.|S
me001|like we grabbed the linear fitting stuff.|S
me018|uh.|S
me018|i see.|S
me001|we did all the alignments.|S
me001|and all the matching and stuff.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
mn014|and|D
me001|but the actual coding of the|D
mn014|and|D
me001|the math was done somewhere else.|S
mn014|these are our f zero candidates which i'm supposed to use for the synthesis thing?|Q
mn014|i suppose?|Q
me001|uh so that's what you were working on.|S
me001|right?|Q
me051|right that's the same software i used to get the data.|S
mn014|yeah okay.|S
mn014|okay.|S
me051|i i gave you a couple examples.|S
mn014|yeah i didn't have time to to look at that.|S
me051|and|F
me011|huh.|D
mn014|so|F
me051|right right.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me011|so other topic is uh the i b m transcription status stuff.|S
me011|so we've sent a few to them.|S
me011|we've gotten a few back.|S
me011|um|F
me011|i sort of wish jane was were here.|S
me011|because i think she gave|D
me011|didn't she give one of them to one of the transcribers?|Q
me018|yeah it's done now.|S
me011|and how was it?|Q
me018|she said it was much faster.|S
me011|great.|S
me018|it really helped a lot to have that.|S
me018|so um you know there were a|D
mn014|much faster than doing everything alone?|Q
me011|hand.|S
me018|from scratch.|S
mn014|okay.|S
me018|yeah so|D
me001|from end to like from the beginning of the process to the end of the process?|Q
me018|no no so from the point where we take it it's faster.|S
me011|well but that's what we wanted.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me011|right?|Q
me011|we knew it would be longer to have multiple groups.|S
me001|ooo yeah.|B
me018|so it's sort of like doing things in parallel.|S
me001|yeah right.|S
me011|right.|B
me018|you know so if you know if they can be working on that while we're working on the other things then when we get them in they don't have to do that one from scratch basically.|S
me011|well pipelined.|S
me001|uhhuh.|B
me001|right.|B
me011|the idea is that we're taking less time of the linguists.|S
me001|right.|B
me011|of the transcribers.|S
me011|so|F
me018|yeah right now it is taking a bit of time to turn around the meetings from i b m.|S
me018|there's there's several problems.|S
me018|one is um we were giving them these large files.|S
me018|which they then had to split up and put onto cassette tapes.|S
me018|so either ninety minute or sixty minute tapes.|S
me001|oh wow.|S
me018|so they had to try to find an appropriate place to break this large file that we gave them.|S
me018|so one of the things that we did is adam made a modification to his script that generates this so you can tell it that you want uh basically uh chunks that are no more than either thirty or forty five minutes.|S
me001|uhhuh.|B
me018|and then we can give those to i b m.|S
me018|and it'll make it easier for them to put them on tape.|S
me018|um then the other thing is that these pool of transcribers that they're using um sort of are not dedicated to to our project.|S
me018|but are in use for all i b m projects.|S
me018|and i b m has recently giving given them uh a whole bunch of stuff.|S
me018|so it's going to sort of delay us.|S
me011|we might want to re visit hiring our own external transcription company.|S
me011|because i think that would be cheaper than having our people do it.|S
me011|but do it with the same process with these beep files.|S
me018|huh that's an interesting idea.|S
me011|i mean because originally i had discounted that.|S
me011|because it was just going to be too hard.|S
me011|but now we have this procedure with the beep files worked out.|S
me018|yeah so the only difference would be we would be putting the stuff on tape versus i b m.|S
me011|then maybe it would be okay.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me011|yep.|B
me018|and then we could send if if we had that process down of putting the audio onto tape|D
me018|we can send i b m the tapes or we can send this transcription place the|D
me011|and we might want to do that anyway.|S
me011|because it seems like that's being a bottleneck and that's silly.|S
me011|it shouldn't be a bottleneck.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me011|i mean it would once we got it set up it it|D
me018|well|D
me018|so i don't know where the bottleneck was.|S
me018|was the bottleneck in breaking this large file up into the appropriate size chunks or was it actually putting it onto the tape?|Q
me011|it may well have been partially that you know.|S
me011|because they tried it.|S
me011|and then they would have to listen to the tape and find out where it bleeps.|S
me018|exactly.|S
me011|and go forward in the file et cetera et cetera.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me011|but uh|F
me018|yeah.|B
me011|it just seems like it's not hard for us to do.|S
me011|and that would just make things go faster.|S
me018|yeah so how do we do that?|S
me018|how would we put|D
me011|get a tape deck.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me018|yeah.|B
me011|plug it in to the computer.|S
mn014|plug it into the sound card.|S
me011|hit record.|S
me011|on the tape deck.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me011|and just do it all all uh analog.|S
me018|so plug so like the headphone output in the back of the computer?|Q
me011|well line out.|S
mn014|line out yeah.|S
me018|line out into the line in on a tape player.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
me001|huh.|B
mn014|yep.|S
me018|and|F
me018|oh well that sounds pretty easy.|S
me011|so i mean that's the easy way.|S
me011|they might have a more complex set up at i b m.|S
me011|i've seen digital digital analog tapes where it's controlled by the computer.|S
mn014|yeah but the easy way is|D
me018|huh.|B
me011|but but we don't need to do that.|S
mn014|yeah i know.|S
mn014|no.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me011|the the disadvantage of doing it this way is it's real time.|S
me011|so you would have to sit there for an hour while it's recording.|S
me018|yeah but if it was at your desk or something|D
me011|but|D
mn014|yeah but you|D
mn014|yeah yeah.|B
me011|right it's not a big deal.|S
me001|so what's the turn around period right now from i b m?|Q
me018|well they there was|D
me001|should we be discussing this|D
me018|okay.|F
me018|so th they um they gave they've given us|D
me018|since we started doing this new uh beep format with beep number beep|D
me001|uhhuh.|B
me018|they've given us uh i think two full uh transcripts.|S
me018|they have a third one.|S
me018|and brian just sent me a note saying oh that third one somehow slipped through the cracks of their of the uh transcriptionists' uh company.|S
me001|huh.|B
me018|and so there's going to be delay of a week before we get that third one back.|S
me018|and i've already given him three more to work on.|S
me001|okay.|B
me018|but he said those new three won't get done until this big chunk of data has been processed by the company.|S
me001|okay.|B
me001|and the transcribers here are still uh are working though.|S
me018|yeah yeah they're working away.|S
me001|they're just doing their own thing like while they're waiting.|S
me018|they're just doing|D
me018|right right.|B
me001|okay.|B
me018|so what we do is uh when i go to um select meetings for i b m i go into the um|D
me018|well into the the uh master sheet here with the statuses|D
me011|master.|S
me001|uhhuh.|B
me018|and i pick ones that thilo has um pre segmented.|S
me018|and i change the status to i p i b m.|S
me018|so that you know when jane or whoever goes to select the next meeting they won't choose one of those.|S
me018|and um|F
me018|so i'm not picking huge chunks right now of meetings for them.|S
me011|so|F
me011|we should at least ask um brian if there are any particular requirements for putting things on tape.|S
me001|uhhuh.|B
me018|but|D
me011|is there a particular type of tape that they want to use or anything else like that?|Q
me018|uhhuh that's a good idea.|S
me011|and uh|F
me011|and then we should see how much of a pain it is for one of us.|S
me011|i mean the the other problem is you would want to do it on an unloaded machine.|S
me011|right?|Q
me011|because you wouldn't want it to start stuttering.|S
mn014|yep.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me018|yeah.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me018|huh.|S
me011|and that means that that's more of a problem.|S
mn014|and all|D
me011|because then you have to be there.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
mn014|and all of the p cs are connected to the network too here?|Q
me001|what|D
mn014|or uh|F
me011|right.|S
me001|you're just talking about playing it and recording it like real time?|Q
mn014|bad|D
me011|yep.|S
me001|oh.|S
me018|so when that thing when it stutters like that is it because there's a delay getting the data off a disk or is it because there's a delay in the d to a?|Q
me011|uhhuh.|S
me011|it could be either.|S
me011|i mean there are lots of different places.|S
me018|okay.|S
me011|it can be delay on the disk.|S
me011|or it can be just load gets high on the machine.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me011|um either i o load or processor load.|S
me018|i see.|S
me011|you know it's a problem with these multi user systems is that lots of processes are running.|S
me011|and you don't really have control.|S
me018|maybe we could do it from a a p c or something.|S
mn014|yeah.|S
mn014|but they are also on the networks.|S
me018|yeah.|B
mn014|so|F
me051|if you used a line out too you have to worry about if you click around and you hit a beep or something it'll beep onto onto the tape too.|S
mn014|maybe.|S
me011|that's true.|S
me011|it'll|D
me011|that's right so you really do want to be using a machine that's not.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
me018|uhhuh.|B
me001|and you have to record every channel separately.|S
me011|no because we're doing the beep files.|S
mn014|the beep files.|S
me018|well you know i i think david might have a bunch of old p cs.|S
me001|oh okay.|S
me018|because he's replacing them with these new ones.|S
me018|maybe we could get one.|S
me018|and just dedicate it to doing this.|S
me018|not even hook it|D
me018|well i guess we need to hook it to the network.|S
me001|we|D
me018|so we can get the files to it.|S
me018|but|F
me011|yep.|S
me018|uh|F
me011|or you could just you could have it no active connection.|S
me011|just s c p them.|S
me018|yeah right.|S
me018|and then just use that machine to hook up to the tape.|S
me011|actually it wouldn't be bad to have that plus put on that machine a c d burner.|S
mn014|yep.|S
me018|yeah.|S
me018|we don't need a powerful machine to do these things.|S
me018|right?|Q
me011|no.|S
me018|so one of these old pentiums that we have|D
me018|huh!|S
me018|should talk to him about that.|S
mn014|or even a d v d burner.|S
me011|a d v d burner yeah.|S
me001|uhhuh.|B
me011|i guess the real question is where would we put it and who would do it?|Q
me011|i guess whoever records the meeting.|S
me011|i mean it's not a big deal.|S
me011|but it's yet another thing you have to do.|S
me018|yeah yeah.|S
me018|that's why i wanted to avoid having to do that if we could.|S
me018|but|F
me018|it's just another|D
me001|they couldn't use c ds?|Q
me011|no because the transcription company does what they do.|S
me018|they have a um a device that you put the cassette in.|S
me018|and it has a foot pedal that lets you go back and forth and stuff like that.|S
me001|oh i see.|S
me001|i see.|S
me018|so|F
me018|i guess they haven't got a|D
me011|actually there are a few i saw a web based one at one point.|S
mn014|web based?|Q
me011|where you could send them audio files over the web.|S
me011|and they send you back text files over the web.|S
me018|really?|Q
me011|i should look that up again.|S
me018|can you send them huge audio files?|Q
mn014|you can.|S
mn014|but they never will be able to read them.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me011|i assume that you can send them anything that they can access with h t t p.|S
me018|huh!|S
me001|well they must be dealing with large amounts of data if they're transcribing anyway.|S
me018|that's interesting.|S
mn014|yeah.|S
me001|i mean people probably aren't sending them you know an utterance or two.|S
me018|well that's true.|S
me018|are how big are these files that we send to brian?|Q
mn014|uh pfff!|D
me011|half a gig.|S
me018|really?|Q
me018|that big?|Q
me011|oh no wait.|S
me018|i thought it was like a hundred megs.|S
me011|they're the beep files.|S
me011|yeah it's a hundred meg.|S
me011|they're the beep files.|S
me011|that's right.|S
me011|so they're smaller.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me018|huh!|S
me018|that's still pretty dang big.|S
me011|yes.|S
mn014|send it via email.|S
me018|yeah.|S
me011|and we are sending them the compressed ones.|S
me011|right?|Q
me018|i don't know.|S
me018|whatever you generate|D
me011|yeah.|B
me018|yeah the last ones you did were compressed.|S
me011|were shortened.|S
me011|yeah.|B
me018|yeah.|B
me018|wonder if the ones before that were shortened.|S
me011|yeah.|B
me011|the beep files actually the shorten doesn't save a whole lot.|S
me011|right?|Q
me018|because it's all|D
me011|because the whole point is that it's extracting parts that are loud anyway.|S
mn014|it's all speech.|S
mn014|yeah yeah.|B
me018|uhhuh.|B
me018|huh!|S
me011|so|F
me018|huh.|B
me011|i think it only saves like half.|S
mn014|only.|S
me011|okay so i think we just got to let things slide for now.|S
me011|and see see what's going to happen.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me011|nothing else really to do.|S
me011|um|F
me011|we have new equipment that i'm going to try to set up tomorrow.|S
me011|new wireless.|S
me018|what will that do?|Q
me011|and so uh|F
me018|is that going to|D
me011|give us a couple more wireless channels.|S
me018|oh so we can get rid of the uh|D
me011|yep.|S
me018|oh that'll be nice.|S
me011|yep.|S
me011|but it involves rewiring.|S
me011|and so if i could borrow someone tomorrow afternoon to help my brain|D
me018|i should be around.|S
me011|you know just have someone to bounce the instructions off of.|S
me011|and make sure i don't do anything too stupid.|S
mn014|yeah sure.|S
me011|did i have another topic on the on the list?|Q
me018|experiments?|Q
me001|isn't that next week?|Q
mn014|experiments?|Q
me011|that's|D
me018|yeah i guess that's probably next|D
mn014|yeah.|B
mn014|these are next week.|S
me011|what did i have on the agenda i mailed out?|Q
me018|yeah.|B
me001|i think it was|D
me001|oh yeah i don't know.|S
mn014|the demo.|S
me018|something about|D
me001|the demo was one of them.|S
mn014|demo and i b m i think.|S
me018|demo.|S
me011|yeah that's it.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me001|yeah i think that's it.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me011|that was it.|S
me018|yeah.|B
mn014|short meeting?|Q
me018|yeah.|S
me011|short meeting.|S
me011|does anyone have anything else?|Q
me018|oh i made a|D
me018|oh but that's not specific to meeting recorder.|S
me018|i was going to say i took some a suggestion of adam's.|S
me018|and i um created a c g i script that lets you see the current status of the speech disks.|S
me001|uhhuh.|B
me018|so if you go to the speech local web page and then there's a disk status page.|S
me018|you can click on that.|S
me018|and it'll query abbott.|S
me018|and give you a a list of all the disks that we have.|S
me018|and then uh what's on each one.|S
me018|and then it shows how big the disk is.|S
me018|and what percent full it is.|S
me001|cool.|S
me018|so|F
me018|and that's you know each time you go there it's updated.|S
me018|so|F
me001|so the new disks are installed now?|Q
mn014|so what what|D
me001|or|D
me018|the new disks are installed.|S
me018|if you need space just let me know.|S
me018|i have to create the appropriate sub directory.|S
me018|so we're kind of trying to keep even the scratch ones we're keeping a little organized where we put a a u doctor speech data.|S
me001|uhhuh.|B
me018|and then i'll either create a sub directory for like if it's meeting recorder project or hub five or whatever.|S
me018|so we|D
me018|i just have to create those sub directories.|S
me001|okay.|B
me011|do we have new d d disks also?|Q
me018|and|D
me018|no.|S
me011|darn.|S
me018|no.|S
me018|nnn.|D
me011|so it's all just scratch.|S
me018|it's all scratch.|S
me011|okay.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me011|how are we doing on|D
me018|uh d e which is where we're putting all the meeting stuff|D
me011|no d e is full.|S
me011|we must be doing it on d f.|S
me018|no it's d e.|S
mn014|d e i think.|S
me018|d e's not full.|S
mn014|yeah?|Q
mn014|d d is full.|S
me018|d d's full.|S
me018|that was the first one.|S
me018|or that was the last one that filled up.|S
me018|and d e still had like|D
me011|okay i guess i'm just one off.|S
me018|last time i looked it was like seven gigs or something.|S
me011|okay.|S
me018|so|F
me018|and each meeting is roughly half a gig.|S
me011|half.|S
me018|and so|F
me011|so that means we're getting pretty close.|S
me018|we're getting close.|S
me018|yeah.|S
me018|so|F
me011|shoot!|S
me001|are we just going to keep recording?|Q
me018|yeah.|B
me001|like at some point|D
me018|morgan said something about stopping at the end of the year.|S
me001|okay.|S
me018|like when we get around a hundred meetings.|S
me001|okay.|S
me018|um because there's going to be data coming from u w hopefully by then.|S
me001|because|D
me011|i just hate not to get data.|S
me001|how|D
me018|yeah it feels funny.|S
me018|huh?|Q
me001|you're a data fiend.|S
me018|if we have the capability.|S
me011|yeah.|B
me001|yeah it's like you build this room up for so long.|S
me001|and then it's just like you stop.|S
me018|now that we're used to recording it's like uh well why not keep going?|Q
me011|i the other thing we could do is stop doing the regular ones.|S
me011|and try to convince other topics to come in and do some.|S
me011|because i think that would be nice.|S
me018|uhhuh.|S
me018|we have right now like seventy five or seventy six hours of meetings.|S
me011|yeah the other thing we were talking about also is once we once the disk has been backed up we don't actually need it online.|S
me011|so another option is to copy it to tape manually.|S
me011|so we have the back up copy and the tape copy.|S
me011|the archive copy and the back up copy.|S
me011|and then just take them off line.|S
me018|but aren't we still using the uh compressed|D
me011|once we have the expanded versions.|S
me011|so if we have a ton of scratch disk maybe the thing to do is leave those up.|S
me018|oh.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me011|and then use and then not necessarily have the original data online.|S
me018|yeah we need to figure something out.|S
me018|because the abbott is basically|D
me011|full.|S
me018|we can't add anymore disks to it.|S
me018|we can increase the size of the disks that are on it.|S
me018|but that will only take us so far.|S
me018|so um|F
me018|david had the suggestion about you know new servers and things like that.|S
me018|and so i'm going to see if we can talk to morgan about getting some money for a new disk server.|S
me018|and uh|F
me011|well that would be pretty tight in the machine room.|S
me018|yeah it would have to replace abbott basically.|S
me011|eesh!|S
me018|yeah.|B
me018|well he david's planning to get new servers anyways for all of the main servers.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
me018|i think he wants to sort of go with the same type of machine for all of these.|S
me018|but um|F
me018|yeah it's full in there.|S
me018|have you seen it recently with all of the new machines that we got|D
me001|uhhuh.|B
me018|uh the sun blade one hundreds.|S
me018|they're like stacked up on benches and things all over.|S
me018|it's really crowded.|S
me018|so|F
mn014|but they are not yet accessible?|Q
mn014|the new machines.|S
me018|oh yeah yeah yeah.|S
mn014|yeah they are?|Q
me018|they're in the yeah if you do a p make|D
mn014|oop!|S
me011|what are they called?|Q
me011|what are they named?|Q
mn014|yeah.|B
me018|oh i've forgotten now.|S
me018|um|F
me011|i assume they're in the p make pool.|S
me018|yeah they're in the p make pool.|S
me018|so if you do a reginfo minus show attribute and|D
me018|uh|F
mn014|a what?|Q
me018|a|D
me011|p make stuff.|S
me011|p make magic.|S
me018|yeah|B
me011|or customs magic.|S
mn014|oh god!|S
me018|you can get a list of all the machines that are available to p make by using the command reginfo.|S
mn014|okay.|S
mn014|reginfo okay.|S
me018|minus show a t t r.|S
mn014|maybe you can send me that.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me018|yeah.|S
me018|and then um|D
me011|if you do man customs it has almost all of that.|S
mn014|okay.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me018|and i i'm not sure what attributes we attach to the sun blade one hundreds.|S
me018|but it could be s.b. one hundred.|S
me018|and so if you query for all machines that have that attribute then you should see the names of the new machines.|S
mn014|okay.|B
mn014|okay.|S
me018|but|F
me011|do we have an attribute for non interactive machines?|Q
me011|because i was thinking that would be a good one to have.|S
me018|non interactive|D
me011|ones that aren't on people's desks.|S
me018|well there's sort of.|S
me018|there's this one called there's the attribute called what's that called uh uh no evict.|S
me018|which is roughly that.|S
me011|right.|S
me018|it's although it's like my machine has it on my desk.|S
me018|so i do get jobs running on my machine all the time.|S
me018|um but uh|F
me018|so so that's that's sort of what it is.|S
me011|yep.|B
me018|uhhuh.|B
me011|anyway.|F
me011|shall we do digits?|Q
me018|sure.|S
