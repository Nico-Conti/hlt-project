me013|all right.|S
me013|so|D
me011|so are you|D
me011|are we going?|Q
me013|it is uh must be february fifteenth.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
me011|i think the date's written in there yep.|S
me011|and actually if everyone could cross out the r nine next to session and write m r eleven.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me013|yeah.|B
me013|we didn't have a front end meeting today.|S
me011|and let's remember also to make sure that one's gets marked as unread unused.|S
me013|okay.|B
mn014|m r eleven?|Q
me011|m r eleven.|S
fe008|that sounds like a spy code.|S
me013|huh.|D
me013|okay.|S
me013|so|D
me011|there's lots of clicking i'm sure as i'm trying to get this to work correctly.|S
me013|agenda.|S
me013|any agenda items today?|Q
me011|i want to talk a little bit about getting how we're going to to get people to edit bleeps parts of the meeting that they don't want to include.|S
me011|what i've done so far and i want to get some opinions on how to how to finish it up.|S
me013|okay.|S
fe008|i want to ask about um some audio monitoring on some of the um well some of the equipment.|S
fe008|in particular the|D
fe008|well uh that's just what i want to ask.|S
me013|okay audio monitoring jane.|S
fe008|based on some of the uh|D
fe008|in listening to some of these meetings that have already been recorded there are sometimes big spikes on particular things.|S
fe008|and in pact in fact this one i'm talking on is one of of the ones that showed up in one of the meetings.|S
fe008|so i|D
me011|oh really?|Q
fe008|uhhuh.|S
fe008|yeah.|S
me018|spikes you mean like uh instantaneous click type spikes or|D
mn014|spikes?|Q
me011|clicks.|S
fe008|yeah.|S
me013|huh.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
me018|huh.|D
fe008|and i don't know what the electronics is but|D
fe008|yeah.|B
me011|yeah.|B
me011|well i think it's|D
mn014|touching.|S
me011|uh it it could be a number of things.|S
me011|it could be touching and fiddling.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me011|and the other thing is that it could|D
me011|the fact that it's on a wired mike is suspicious.|S
me011|it might be a connector.|S
fe008|oh okay.|S
fe008|well maybe|D
fe008|then we don't really have to talk about that as an|D
fe008|i i take that off the agenda.|S
me018|you could try an experiment and say okay i'm about to test for spikes.|S
me018|and then wiggle the thing there.|S
me018|and then go and when they go to transcribe it it could ask them to come and get you.|S
me011|yeah.|B
me011|right.|B
fe008|oh that|D
me018|come get me when you transcribe this and see if there's spikes.|S
me013|um|F
fe008|well okay.|S
me018|no i'm just|D
me013|i mean were this a professional audio recording what we would do what you would do is in testing it is you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that that that things are not giving that kind of performance.|S
me013|and if they are then they can't be used.|S
me011|right.|B
me013|so|F
me013|um let's see.|S
me013|i guess i would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh recording transcription.|S
me013|you know basically you know where we are on the corpus.|S
fe008|good.|D
me013|and then um the other thing which i would like to talk about which is a real meta quest i think deal is uh agendas.|S
me013|so maybe i'll i'll start with that actually.|S
me013|uh um andreas brought up the fact that he would kind of like to know if possible what we were going to be talking about.|S
me013|because he's sort of peripherally involved to this point.|S
me013|and if there's going to be a topic about discussion about something that he uh strongly cares about then he would come.|S
me013|and and i think part of part of his motivation with this is that he's trying to help us out.|S
me013|in the because of uh the fact that the meetings are are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up.|S
me013|and so he figures he could help that out by not showing.|S
me013|and and i'm sure help out his own time.|S
me011|huh.|B
me013|by not showing up if it's a meeting that he's he's|D
me013|so uh in order|D
me013|i'd i think that this is a wish on his part.|S
me013|uh it's actually going to be hard.|S
me013|because it seems like a lot of times uh things come up that are unanticipated.|S
me013|and and|D
me013|but um we could try anyway.|S
me011|right.|B
me013|uh do another try at coming up with the agenda uh at some point before the meeting.|S
me013|uh say the day before.|S
me011|well maybe it would be a good idea for one of us to like on wednesday or tuesday send out a reminder for people to send in agenda items.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me013|okay.|S
me013|you you want to volunteer to do that?|Q
me011|sure.|S
me013|okay.|S
me013|all right so we'll send out agenda request.|S
me013|uh|F
me011|let me|D
me018|that'll be|D
me018|i think that'll help|D
me011|i'll put that on my spare brain or it will not get done.|S
me018|that'll help a lot actually.|S
me013|yeah i have to tell you for the uh for the admin meeting that we have lila does that um every time before an admin meeting.|S
me013|and uh she ends up getting the agenda requests uh uh ten minutes before the meeting.|S
me013|but but but|D
me013|uh but we can try.|S
me013|maybe it'll work.|S
me011|yeah.|S
me018|huh.|B
me011|maybe.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me011|weirder things have happened.|S
fe008|i'm wondering if he were to just uh specify particular topics.|S
fe008|i mean|D
fe008|maybe we'd be able to meet that request of his a little more.|S
me018|i would i would also guess that as we get more into processing the data and things like that there'll be more things of interest to him.|S
me011|well then|D
me013|yeah.|B
me013|actually it|D
me013|this this maybe brings up another topic which is um|D
me013|so we're done with that topic.|S
me013|the other topic i was thinking of was the status on microphones and channels and all that.|S
me011|yeah actually i i was going to say we need to talk about that too.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me013|why why don't we do that?|Q
me011|okay.|S
me011|um the new microphones the two new ones are in.|S
me011|um and they are being assembled as we speak i hope.|S
me011|and i didn't bring my car today so i'm going to pick them up tomorrow.|S
me011|um and then the other question i was thinking about is well a couple things.|S
me011|first of all if the other headsets are a lot more comfortable we should probably just go ahead and get them.|S
me011|so we'll have to evaluate that when they come in.|S
me011|and get people's opinions on on what they think of them.|S
mn014|uhhuh.|B
me011|um then the other question i had is maybe we should get another wireless.|S
me011|another wireless setup.|S
me011|i mean it's expensive but it does seem to be better than the wired.|S
me013|so how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup?|Q
me011|um well i'm pretty sure that you can daisy chain them together.|S
me011|so what we would do is replace the wired mikes with wireless.|S
me011|so we currently have one base station with six wireless mike.|S
me011|possibility of six wireless receivers.|S
me011|and apparently you can chain those together.|S
me011|and so we could replace our wired mikes with wireless if we bought another base station and more wireless mikes.|S
me013|so um|D
me011|and|D
me013|so let's see we|D
me011|so you know it's still it's fifteen minus six.|S
me011|right?|Q
me011|so we could have up to nine.|S
me013|and right now we can have up to six.|S
me011|right.|S
me011|and we have five we're getting one more.|S
me013|yeah.|S
me011|and it's um about nine hundred dollars for the base station.|S
me011|and then eight hundred per channel.|S
me013|oh.|S
me013|so yeah so the only|D
me013|beyond the mike the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that's nine hundred dollars.|S
me011|right.|S
me013|oh we should do it.|S
me011|okay.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me011|okay so i'll look into how you daisy chain them and and then just go ahead and order them.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me018|i don't quite understand how that how that works.|S
me018|if|D
me018|so we're not increasing the number of channels.|S
me011|no we're just replacing the wired the two wired that are still working.|S
me018|okay.|S
me018|okay.|S
me018|i see.|S
me011|along with a couple of the wired that aren't working one of the wired that's not working with a wireless.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me013|basically we found|D
me018|three wireds work.|S
me018|right?|Q
me011|i i guess three wireds work yeah.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me018|yeah.|B
me013|yeah.|F
me013|but we've had more problems with that.|S
me011|yep.|B
me013|and that sort of bypasses the whole the whole jimbox thing and all that.|S
me011|right.|B
me013|and so um we we seem to have uh a reliable way of getting the data in which is through the sony radio mikes.|S
me013|as long as we're conscious about the batteries.|S
me013|that seems to be the key issue.|S
me011|right.|B
me011|everyone's battery okay?|Q
me018|i checked them this morning.|S
me018|they should be.|S
me011|okay.|S
me013|yeah.|F
me013|um because that's the only thing with them.|S
me013|but the quality seems really good.|S
me013|and|F
me013|um i heard from u w that they're they're uh very close to getting their uh setup purchased.|S
me013|they're they're they're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf.|S
me011|well we should talk to them about it because i know that s r i is also in the process of looking at stuff.|S
me011|and so you know what we should try to keep everyone on the same page with that.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me018|s r i?|Q
me018|really?|Q
me011|yeah.|S
me018|oh.|S
me011|they got|D
me011|well maybe this needs to be bleeped out?|Q
me011|i have no clue.|S
me013|uh i don't know.|S
me011|i don't know how much of it's public.|S
me013|probably we shouldn't probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff.|S
me011|right.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me013|but anyway there's there's there's uh uh other activities that are going on there and and uh and nist and u w.|S
me013|so|F
me013|um but but yeah i i think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is is quite positive with the sony.|S
me013|uh radio mikes.|S
me011|right.|B
me013|now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you're talking about changing the headsets.|S
me013|meaning changing the connector which means some hand soldering or something.|S
me013|right?|Q
me011|uh no.|S
me013|no?|Q
me011|we're having the them do it.|S
me011|so it's hand soldering it but i'm not doing it.|S
me013|oh.|S
me013|okay.|S
me011|so they they charge.|S
me013|nothing against you and your hand soldering.|S
me011|right?|Q
me013|but|F
me011|you've never seen my hand soldering.|S
me011|but uh as i said they're coming in.|S
me013|uh okay so that's being done professionally|D
me013|and|F
me013|yeah.|B
me011|i i mean|D
me011|yeah.|S
me011|i mean|F
me013|yeah.|S
me011|as professionally as i guess you can get it done.|S
me013|well it could|D
me013|if they do a lot of it it's|D
me011|i mean it's just their repair shop.|S
me011|right?|Q
me011|their maintenance people.|S
me013|well we'll see what it it's like.|S
me011|yep.|B
me013|that that can be quite good.|S
me013|this|D
me013|yeah okay.|S
me013|good.|F
me013|yeah.|F
me013|so let's go with that.|S
me013|uh|F
me011|and i mean we'll see tomorrow you know what it looks like.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me013|so um uh dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits.|S
me013|uh so he'll be interested in what's going on with that.|S
me013|i guess|D
me013|was the decision last time was that the the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well?|Q
fe008|uhhuh.|S
me013|has that started or is that|D
fe008|yeah.|S
fe008|uh it would be to use his interface and i was going to meet with him today about that.|S
me011|right so the decision was that jane did not want the transcribers to be doing any of the paperwork.|S
me011|so i did the all that last week.|S
me011|so all the all the forms are now on the computer.|S
me011|and uh then i have a bunch of scripts that we'll read those and let the uh transcribers use different tools.|S
me011|and i just want to talk to jane about how we transition to using those.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe008|so he has a nice set up that they|D
fe008|it it will be efficient for them to do that.|S
me013|okay.|S
me013|so anyway|D
me011|i i don't think it'll take too long.|S
me011|so you know just uh a matter of a few days i suspect.|S
me013|so anyway i think we we have at least one uh user for the digits once they get done which will be dave.|S
me011|right.|S
me011|i've already done five or six sets.|S
fe008|okay.|D
me011|so if he wanted to you know just have a few to start with he could.|S
me013|yeah he might he might be asking|D
me011|you know and i also have a bunch of scripts that will like generate p files and run recognition on them also.|S
me013|right.|B
me013|okay.|B
me013|uh is dave|D
me013|i don't know if dave is on the list.|S
me013|if he's invited to these meetings|D
me013|uh|F
fe008|i don't tend to get an invitation myself for them even.|S
me013|if he knows|D
mn014|no no.|D
me011|uh we don't have a active one.|S
me011|but i'll make sure he's on the list.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe008|should we call him?|Q
fe008|i mean is he is he definitely not available today?|Q
me013|i don't know.|S
fe008|should i call his office and see?|Q
me013|uh well it's uh|D
mn014|he was in.|S
me011|i mean he's still taking classes so uh he may well have conflicts.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me013|yeah.|S
mn014|yeah he was in|D
fe008|he wasn't there at|D
me013|yeah so this might be a conflict for him.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
fe008|okay.|B
me013|yeah.|B
me013|okay.|B
me013|uh so|D
me011|yeah didn't he say his signal processing class was like tuesdays and thursdays?|Q
mn014|i think he has a class.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me018|yeah.|S
me018|he might have.|S
me013|oh okay.|S
mn009|you talking about david gelbart?|Q
me011|oh well whatever.|S
me013|yeah.|S
me018|yeah.|S
me011|yeah.|S
fe008|yes.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
mn009|yeah i think he's taking two twenty five a which is now.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe008|okay.|S
mn009|so|F
me018|yeah.|B
me013|okay.|B
me013|so that's why we're not seeing him.|S
me013|okay.|F
me013|uh transcriptions uh beyond the digits where we are and so on.|S
fe008|okay.|S
me013|and the and the recordings also.|S
fe008|um|F
me013|just where we are.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe008|well so um should we we don't want to do the recording status first or|D
me011|well we have about thirty two hours.|S
me011|uh as of i guess a week and a half ago.|S
me011|so we probably now have about thirty five hours.|S
me013|and and that's that's uh|D
me013|how much of that is digits?|Q
me013|it's uh|D
me013|that's including digits.|S
me011|that's including digits.|S
me013|right?|Q
me013|so|D
me011|i haven't separated it out so i have no clue how much of that is digits.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me013|so anyway there's at least probably thirty hours.|S
me013|or something of|D
me013|there's got to be more than thirty hour|D
me013|it couldn't|D
me011|of of non digits?|Q
me013|of of non digits.|S
mn014|huh.|B
me011|yeah absolutely.|S
me013|yeah yeah.|B
me011|i mean the digits don't take up that much time.|S
me013|okay.|S
fe008|okay and the transcribers|D
fe008|i uh don't have the exact numbers.|S
fe008|but i think it would come to about eleven hours that are finished uh transcribing from them right now.|D
fe008|the next step is to that i'm working on is to insure that the data are clean first and then channelized.|D
fe008|what i mean by clean is that they're spell checked.|D
fe008|that the mark up is consistent all the way throughout.|D
fe008|and also that we now incorporate these additional conventions that uh liz requested in terms of um um in terms of having a a systematic handling of numbers and acronyms which i hadn't been specific about.|D
fe008|um for example they'll say uh ninety two.|S
fe008|and you know so how you could|D
me011|nine two.|S
fe008|exactly.|S
me011|right.|B
fe008|so if you just say nine two the there are many ways that could have been expressed.|S
fe008|and i just had them|D
fe008|i i mean a certain number of them did put the words down.|S
fe008|but now we have a convention which also involves having it followed by um a gloss and things.|S
me018|you know jane?|Q
me011|uhhuh.|B
me018|um one suggestion|D
me018|and you may already be doing this.|S
me018|but i've noticed in the past that when i've gone through transcriptions and you know in in order to build lexicons and things|D
me018|if you um just take all the transcriptions and separate them into words and then alphabetize them a lot of times just scanning down that list you'll find a lot of inconsistencies and|D
me011|misspelled.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
fe008|you're talking about the type token frequency listings and i use those too.|S
fe008|you mean just uh on each on each line there's a one word.|S
fe008|right?|Q
fe008|it's one token from the from the corpus.|S
me018|uhhuh.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
fe008|yeah those are extremely efficient.|S
fe008|and and i i agree that's a very good use of it.|S
me018|oh so you already have that.|S
me018|okay.|B
fe008|well that's that's a way that's|D
fe008|you know the spell check basically does that.|S
fe008|but but in addition|D
fe008|yes that's that's exactly the strategy i want to do in terms of locating these things which are you know colloquial spoken forms which aren't in the lexicon.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
fe008|exactly.|B
me018|because a lot of times they'll appear next to each other and uh|D
fe008|and then you then you can do a|D
mn014|yeah.|B
me018|in alphabetized lists they'll appear next to each other and and so it makes it easier.|S
fe008|absolutely.|S
fe008|i agree.|S
fe008|that's a very good that's a very good uh suggestion.|S
fe008|and that was that's my strategy for handling a lot of these things in terms of things that need to be glossed.|S
fe008|i didn't get to that point.|S
fe008|but|D
fe008|so there are numbers then there are acronyms.|S
fe008|and then um there's a she wants the uh actually a an explicit marker of what type of comment this is.|S
fe008|so curly inside the curly brackets i'm going to put either voc for vocalized.|S
fe008|like cough or like laugh or whatever.|S
fe008|nonvoc for door slam.|S
fe008|and gloss for things that have to do with if they said a a spoken form with this this pronunciation error.|S
me011|right.|B
fe008|i already had that convention.|S
fe008|but i i haven't been asking these people to do it systematically.|S
me018|oh that's great.|S
fe008|because i think it most most efficiently handled by uh by a a filter.|S
fe008|that was what i was always planing on.|S
fe008|so that you know you get a whole long list|D
fe008|exactly what you're saying.|S
fe008|you get a whole list of things that say curly bracket laugh curly bracket.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
fe008|then you know it's it's|D
fe008|you you risk less error if you handle it by a filter than if you have this transcriber laboriously typing in sort of a voc space|D
me018|yeah.|B
fe008|so so many ways that error prone.|S
me018|right.|B
me018|right.|B
fe008|so um um i'm i'm going to convert that via a filter into these tagged uh subcategorized comments.|S
fe008|and same thing with you know we see you get a subset when you do what you're saying.|S
fe008|you end up with a with uh you're collapsing across a frequency you just have the tokens.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and you can um have a filter which more efficiently makes those changes.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
fe008|but the numbers and acronyms have to be handled by hand.|S
fe008|because you know i mean|D
me011|you don't know what they could be.|S
fe008|yeah now timit's clear um and p l p is clear.|S
me018|yeah.|B
fe008|but uh there are things that are not so well known in|D
fe008|or or have variant uses like the numbers you can say nine two or you can say ninety two.|S
fe008|and uh|F
me011|so how are you doing the|D
fe008|i'd handle the numbers individually.|S
me011|how are you doing the uh acronyms so if i say p z m what would it appear on the transcript?|Q
fe008|it would be separate.|S
fe008|the letters would be separated in space.|S
me011|okay.|S
fe008|and potentially they'll have a curly bracket thing afterwards.|S
fe008|but i'm not sure if that's necessary clarifying what it is.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
fe008|so gloss of whatever.|S
me011|right.|B
fe008|i don't know if that's really necessary to do that.|S
fe008|maybe it's a nice thing to do because of it then indicating this is uh a step away from indicating that it really is intentional that those spaces are there.|S
fe008|and indicating why they're there to indicate that it's uh the you know uh enumerated or|D
me011|uhhuh.|B
fe008|it's not a good way of saying.|S
fe008|but it's it's the specific uh way of stating these these letters.|S
me011|right.|B
me011|so it sounds good.|S
fe008|and so anyway the clean those are those things.|S
fe008|and then channelized is to then um get it into this multichannel format.|S
fe008|and at that point then it's ready for use by liz and don.|S
fe008|but that's been my top priority beyond getting it channelized.|S
fe008|the next step is to work on tightening up the boundaries of the time bins.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me011|right.|B
fe008|and uh thilo had a a breakthrough with this this last week in terms of getting the channel based um uh speech-nonspeech segmentation um up and running.|S
fe008|and i haven't i haven't been able to use that yet.|S
fe008|because i'm working|D
fe008|this is my top priority get the data clean and channelized.|S
mn014|i actually gave|D
me011|have you also been doing spot checks jane?|Q
fe008|oh yes.|S
me011|okay good.|S
fe008|well you see that's part of the cleaning process.|S
fe008|i spent um|D
fe008|actually um i have a segment of ten minutes that was transcribed by two of our transcribers.|S
me011|oh good.|S
me011|good.|S
fe008|and i went through it last night it's it's almost spooky how similar these are word for word.|S
fe008|and there are some differences in commas because commas i i left them discretion at commas.|S
me011|right.|B
fe008|uh and so|D
fe008|because it's not part of our of our needed conventions.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and um|F
fe008|and so they'll be a difference in commas.|S
fe008|but it's word by word the same in in huge patches of the data.|S
fe008|and i have ten minute stretch where i can where i can show that.|S
fe008|and and sometimes it turns out that one of these transcribers has a better ear for technical jargon.|S
fe008|and the other one has a better ear for colloquial speech.|S
fe008|so um the one the colloquial speech person picked up gobbledy gook.|S
me018|huh.|B
fe008|and the other one didn't.|S
fe008|and on this side this one's picking up things like neural nets and the one that's good on the on the vocabulary on the uh colloquial didn't.|S
me011|right.|B
me018|when|D
me018|for the person who missed gobbledy gook what did they put?|Q
fe008|it was an interesting approximation put in parentheses.|S
fe008|because i have this convention that if they're not sure what it was they put it in parentheses.|S
me018|oh.|S
fe008|so they tried to approximate it but it was|D
me018|oh good.|S
fe008|it was spelled g a b b l|D
me018|sort of how it sounds?|Q
fe008|yes.|S
fe008|more of an attempt to|D
me018|yeah.|B
fe008|i mean apparently it was very clear to her that these this this was a sound these are the sounds.|S
me011|it was a technical term that she didn't recognize.|S
me018|yeah.|S
fe008|but|F
fe008|yeah.|F
fe008|but she knew that she didn't know it.|S
fe008|maybe it was a technical|D
fe008|exactly.|S
fe008|but she even though her technical perception is just really uh you|D
fe008|know i've i'm tempted to ask her if she's taken any courses in this area or if she's taken cognitive science courses.|S
me011|right.|B
fe008|then because neural nets and oh she has some things that are oh down sampled she got that right.|S
me018|huh.|B
fe008|and some of these are rather uh unexpected.|S
me011|obscure.|S
me011|yeah.|B
fe008|but ten solid uh chunk of ten solid minutes where they both coded the same data.|S
fe008|and um|D
me013|and and again the main track that you're working with is eleven hours?|Q
me013|is that right?|Q
fe008|yes exactly.|S
me013|yeah okay.|S
fe008|and that's part of this|D
fe008|eleven hours.|S
me013|is that is that that including digits?|Q
fe008|yes it is.|S
me013|yeah.|S
me013|so let's say roughly ten hours or so of|D
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me013|i mean it's probably more than that but but with of of non digits.|S
fe008|it'd be more than that.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
fe008|because i my recollection is the minutes that digits don't take more than half a minute per person.|S
me013|oh okay.|S
fe008|but um the the total set that i gave them is twelve hours of tape.|S
me013|oh i see.|S
fe008|but they haven't gotten to the end of that yet.|S
fe008|so they're still working some of them are two of them are still working on completing that.|S
me013|oh i see.|S
fe008|yeah.|S
me018|boy they're moving right along.|S
fe008|yeah they are.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe008|uhhuh they're very efficient.|S
fe008|there're some who have more hours that they devote to it than others.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
me018|uhhuh.|B
fe008|yeah.|S
me013|so what what what's the deal with with your|D
mn014|the channel thing?|Q
me013|yeah.|S
mn014|oh it's just uh i ran the recognizer uh the speech-nonspeech detector on different channels.|S
mn014|and it's just in uh in this new multi channel format and output.|S
mn014|and i just gave one one meeting to to liz who wanted to to try it for for the recognizer.|S
me013|oh i see.|S
mn014|as uh apparently the recognizer had problems with those long chunks of speech which took too much memory or whatever.|S
me013|right.|B
me013|yeah.|B
mn014|and so she she will try that i think.|S
mn014|and|F
mn014|i'm i'm working on it.|S
mn014|so i hope|D
me011|is this anything different than the h m m system you were using before?|Q
me013|yeah.|B
mn014|no.|S
mn014|uh i huh use some some different features but not not|D
me011|uhhuh.|B
mn014|the basic thing is this h m m base.|S
me011|so there's still no no knowledge using different channels at the same time.|S
me011|you know what i mean?|Q
mn014|there is some uh as the energy is normalized across channels.|S
me011|across all of them.|S
mn014|yeah.|S
me011|okay.|S
mn014|so|F
mn014|but basically that's one of the main changes.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
me013|uhhuh.|B
me013|what are some of the other features besides the energy?|Q
me013|you said you're trying some different features or something.|S
mn014|oh i just uh huh i just use um our loudness based things.|S
mn014|now as they|D
mn014|before there were they were some in in the log domain and i i changed this to the to the|D
me013|cube root.|S
mn014|yeah.|S
mn014|to|D
mn014|no i changed this to the to the to the loudness thingy with the with the|D
me011|huh.|B
me013|uh.|B
mn014|how do you call it?|Q
mn014|i'm not sure.|S
mn014|with the uh|D
me013|fletcher munson?|Q
me013|no.|S
mn014|i'm not sure about the term.|S
me013|oh okay.|S
mn014|uh i'll look it up.|S
me013|yeah all right.|S
mn014|and say it to you.|S
mn014|uh okay and|F
mn014|yeah.|F
mn014|that's that's basically the the the thing.|S
me013|okay.|B
mn014|yeah and i and i tried to normalize uh uh the features there's loudness and modified loudness um within one channel.|S
mn014|because they're yeah to to be able to distinguish between foreground and background speech.|S
mn014|and it works quite well.|S
mn014|but not always.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
me013|uhhuh.|B
mn014|so|F
me013|okay.|B
me011|good.|B
me013|um let's see.|F
me013|i think the uh|D
me013|were were you basically done with uh transcriptions or|D
me013|so i guess the next thing is this uh bleep editing.|S
me011|right.|S
me011|so the the idea is that we need to have|D
me011|we need to provide the transcripts to every participant of every meeting to give them an opportunity to bleep out sections they don't want.|S
me011|so i've written a bunch of tools that will generate web pages uh with the transcription in it so that they can click on them and piece pieces and they can scroll through and read them.|S
me011|and then they can check on each one if they want it excluded.|S
me011|and then it's a form h t m l form so they can submit it and it will end up sending me e mail with the times that they want excluded.|S
me011|and so uh some of the questions on this is what do we do about the privacy issue.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me011|and so i thought about this a little bit and i think the best way to do it is every participant will have a password.|S
me011|a single password.|S
me011|each person will have a single password user name and password.|S
me011|and then each meeting we'll only allow the participants who were at that meeting to look at it.|S
me011|and that way each person only has to remember one password.|S
me013|i i can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed.|S
me013|i mean if people have|D
me013|uh|F
me013|i mean for me i would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and i would sort of flip through it.|S
me013|and then um if i thought it was okay i'd say it's okay.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
me013|and i|D
me013|uh i mean it depends how this really ends up working out.|S
me013|but i guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was okay or not and needing to listen to it was going to be extremely rare.|S
me011|right i mean so the fact that you could listen to it over the web is a minor thing that i had already done for other reasons.|S
me013|okay.|B
me011|and so that that's a minor part of it.|S
me011|i just wanted some web interface so that people you didn't actually have to send everyone the text.|S
me011|so what my intention to do is that as the transcripts become ready um i would take them and generate the web pages.|S
me011|and send email to every participant or contact them using the contact method they wanted.|S
me011|and just uh tell them here's the web page.|S
me011|um you need a password.|S
me011|so question number one is how do we distribute the passwords?|Q
me011|and question number two is how else do we want to provide this information if they want it?|Q
me013|that's|D
me013|i think what i was sort of saying is that if you just say here is a here is|D
me013|i mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but but i just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper that said uh here's what was said in this transcription is it okay with you.|S
me013|and if it is here's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it's okay.|S
me011|i think that um there are a subset of people who will want printouts that we can certainly provide.|S
me013|and then they'd hand it back to you.|S
me011|but certainly i wouldn't want a printout.|S
me011|these are big.|S
me011|and i would much rather be be able to just sit and leaf through it.|S
me013|you find it easier to go through a large|D
me013|i mean how do you read books?|Q
me011|well i certainly read books by hand.|S
me011|but for something like this i think it's easier to do it on the web.|S
me013|really?|Q
me013|i mean it|D
me011|because you're going to get you know if i i'm i'm in a bunch of meetings and i don't want to get a stack of these.|S
me011|i want to just be able to go to go to the web site and visit it as i want.|S
me013|going to a web site is easy.|S
me013|but flipping through a hundred pounds a hundred pages of stuff is not easy on the web.|S
me011|well i don't think it's that much harder than paper.|S
fe008|i have one question.|S
me013|really?|Q
me011|so|F
fe008|so are you thinking that um the person would have a transcript and go strictly from the transcript?|Q
fe008|because i i do think that there's a benefit to being able to hear the tone of voice and the|D
me013|so here's the way i was imagining it and maybe i'm wrong.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
me013|but the way i imagined it was that um the largest set of people is going to go oh yeah i didn't say anything funny in that meeting.|S
me013|just go ahead.|S
me013|where's the where's the release?|Q
me013|and then there'll be a subset of people.|S
me013|right?|Q
me013|okay there's|D
me013|i mean think of who it is we've been recording mostly.|S
me013|okay there'll be a subset of people who um will say uh well yeah i really would like to see that.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me013|and for them the easiest way to flip through if it's a really large document|D
me013|i mean unless you're searching.|S
me013|searching of course should be electronic.|S
me013|but if you're not|D
me013|so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me013|but see then we're getting more elaborate with this thing.|S
me013|um if if uh you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really really long document.|S
me013|i mean whenever i've had a really really long document that it was sitting on the web i've always ended up printing it out.|S
me013|i mean so it's it's|D
me013|i mean you you're you're not necessarily going to be sitting at the desk all the time.|S
me013|you want to figure you have a train ride and there's all these situations where where i|D
me013|i mean this is how i was imagining it anyway.|S
me013|and then i figured that out of that group there would be a subset who would go huh you know i'm really not sure about this section here.|S
me013|and then that group would need it|D
me013|it seems like|D
me013|if i'm right in that it seems like you're setting it up for the most infrequent case rather than for the most frequent case.|S
me013|so that uh now we have to worry about privacy.|S
me011|well no for the most|D
me013|we have to worry about all these passwords for different people.|S
me011|for the most frequent case they just say it's okay.|S
me011|and then they're done.|S
me011|and i think almost everyone would rather do that by email than any other method.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe008|the other thing too is it seems like|D
me013|um yeah that's true.|S
fe008|go ahead.|S
me011|i mean because you don't have to visit the web page if you don't want to.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me013|i guess|D
me013|yeah i guess we don't need their signature.|S
me013|i guess an email okay is all right.|S
me011|oh that was another thing.|S
me011|i i had assumed that we didn't need their signature that it that an email approval was sufficient.|S
me011|but i don't actually know.|S
me018|are are people going to be allowed to bleep out sections of a meeting where they weren't speaking?|Q
me011|yes.|S
fe008|i also|D
me011|if someone feels strongly enough about it then i i i think they should be allowed to do that.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me018|so that means other people are editing what you say?|Q
me013|uh i don't know about that.|S
me011|yeah.|S
me018|i don't know if i like that.|S
me011|well the only other choice is that the person would say no don't distribute this meeting at all.|S
me011|and i would rather they were able to edit out other people then just say don't distribute it at all.|S
me013|but what they signed in the consent form was something that said you can use my voice.|S
me011|well but if if someone is having a conversation and you only bleep out one side of it that's not sufficient.|S
me013|right?|Q
me013|yeah.|B
me013|yeah but that's our decision then.|S
me013|right?|Q
me011|um i don't think so.|S
me013|i think it is.|S
me011|i mean because if i object to the conversation|D
me011|if i say we were having a conversation and i consider that conversation private and i consider that your side of it is enough for other people to infer i want to be able to bleep out your side.|S
fe008|the|D
fe008|i agree that the consent forms were uh i|D
fe008|i agree with what adam's saying that um the consent form did leave open this possibility that they could edit things which they found offensive whether they said them or didn't say them.|S
me013|i see.|S
me013|okay well if that's what it said.|S
fe008|and the other thing is from the standpoint of the of the|D
fe008|i'm not a lawyer.|S
fe008|but it strikes me that uh we wouldn't want someone to say oh yes i was a little concerned about it.|S
fe008|but it was too hard to access.|S
fe008|so i think it's kind of nice to have this facility to listen to it.|S
fe008|now in terms of like editing it by hand i mean i think it's some people would find that easier to specify the bleep part by having a document they edited.|S
fe008|but but it seems to me that sometimes um you know if a person had a bad day and they had a tone in their voice that they didn't really like you know it's nice it's nice to be able to listen to it and be sure that that was okay.|S
me011|i mean i can certainly provide a printable version if people want it.|S
me013|um i mean it's also a mixture of people.|S
me011|um|F
me013|i mean some people are do their work primarily by sitting at the computer flipping around the web.|S
me013|and others do not.|S
me011|yep.|B
me013|others would consider it|D
me013|this uh a a set of skills that they would have to gain.|S
me013|you know?|Q
me011|well i think most of the people in the meetings are the former.|S
me013|it depends on what meetings.|S
fe008|that's true.|S
me018|so far.|S
me011|so|F
me013|in the meetings so far yeah.|S
me011|yep.|S
me013|but we're trying to expand this.|S
me013|right?|Q
me011|right.|S
me013|so i i i actually think that paper is the more universal thing.|S
me011|and that|D
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me011|well but if they want to print it out that's all right.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
me011|i think everyone in the meeting can access the web.|S
me013|no i think we have to be able to print it out.|S
me013|it's not just if they want to print it out.|S
me011|okay so does that mean that i can't use email?|S
me013|i i think|D
me011|or what?|Q
fe008|because you could send it through email you're thinking.|S
me013|i i|D
me013|well we|D
me011|well i don't think i|D
me013|there was this|D
me011|well i don't think we can send the text through email because of the privacy issues.|S
fe008|good.|S
me013|no.|S
fe008|for security?|Q
fe008|yeah okay good.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me013|right.|B
fe008|good point.|S
me011|um so giving them you think a web site to say if you want to print it out here it is is not sufficient?|Q
mn014|yeah.|B
mn014|i|D
me013|certainly for everybody who's been in the meetings so far it would be sufficient.|S
me013|i'm just wondering about|D
me011|yeah i'm just thinking for people that that's not sufficient for what the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and hand it to them.|S
fe008|you could mail it to them.|S
fe008|get a mailing address.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me011|equivalent.|S
fe008|but i think it's easier to drop in the box.|S
mn014|but|F
mn014|just put the button on on the web page which say please send me the the scripts.|S
fe008|oh that's interesting.|S
me011|that's right.|S
mn014|yeah.|S
me018|what um|D
me018|when you display it on the web page what are what are you showing them?|Q
me018|utterances?|Q
me011|uhhuh.|S
me018|or|D
me018|and so can they bleep within an utterance?|Q
me011|no.|S
me011|whole utterances only.|S
me018|whole utterances.|S
me011|and that was just convenience for my sake that it's uh uh|D
me011|it would end up being fairly difficult to edit the transcripts if we would do it at the sub utterance level.|S
me011|because this way i can just delete an entire line out of a transcript file rather than have to do it by hand.|S
me013|there's another aspect to this which maybe is part of why this is bothering me.|S
me013|um i think you're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this.|S
me011|i mean that's why i did the web form because for me that would be my most convenient.|S
me018|huh.|B
me013|i i i understand.|F
me013|i think that's the bad idea.|S
me018|i know where you're going.|S
me011|oh.|B
me013|see because you're you're uh|D
me013|really!|S
me013|you're going to end up with all these little patchy things whereas really what we want to do is have the the the bias towards letting it go.|S
me013|because you|D
me013|know it|D
me013|there was a|D
me013|one or once or twice in the in the meetings we've heard where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by.|S
me013|but overall people are talking about technical topics.|S
me013|nobody's going to get hurt.|S
me013|nobody's being libeled.|S
me013|you know this is this we're we're covering|D
me013|we're playing the lawyer's game and we're playing we're we're we're looking for the extreme case.|S
me013|if we really orient it towards that extreme case make it really easy we're going to end up encouraging a headache.|S
me013|that i think that's|D
me013|i'm sort of psyching myself out here.|S
me013|i i'm trying to uh|D
me013|but i i think that's|D
me011|i guess i don't see having a few phrases here and there in a meeting being that much of a headache bleeped out.|S
me013|well it's|D
me011|so|F
me013|but|D
me018|i think what morgan's saying is the easier it is the more is going to be bleeped.|S
me013|and and it really depends on what kind of research you're doing.|S
me013|i think some researchers who are going to be working with this corpus years from now are really going to be cursing the fact that there's a bunch of stuff in there that's missing from the dialogue.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
me013|you know it depends on the kind of research they're doing.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me013|but it might be uh it might be really a a pain.|S
me013|and you know where it's really going to hurt somebody in some way.|S
me013|the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out.|S
me013|but i really think we want to make it the rare incidence.|S
me013|and and uh i am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do.|S
me013|and so much fun that they're going to go through and bleep out stuff.|S
fe008|so much fun.|S
me013|and they can bleep out stuff they don't like too.|S
me013|right?|Q
me013|from somebody else as you say.|S
me013|you know so well i didn't like what he said.|S
me011|well i don't see any way of avoiding that.|S
me011|i mean we have to we have promised that we would provide them the transcript and that they can remove parts that they don't like.|S
me013|yeah.|S
me011|so that the|D
me013|no no i i i don't|D
me011|the only question is|D
me013|you've talked me into that.|S
me013|but i i just think that we should make it harder to do.|S
me011|the problem is if it's harder for them it's also harder for me.|S
me011|whereas this web interface i just get email.|S
me011|it's all formatted.|S
me011|it's all ready to go and i can just insert it.|S
me013|so maybe you don't give them access to the web interface unless they really need it.|S
fe008|well i guess|D
me013|so so so|F
fe008|yeah.|B
me013|i'm sorry.|S
me013|so so so maybe this is a a way out of it.|S
fe008|huh.|B
me013|you've provided something that's useful for you to do handle.|S
me013|and useful for someone else if they need it.|S
me013|but i think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that uh they get access to this if they really need it.|S
me011|well|D
me018|so you're saying the the sequence would be more like first adam goes to the contact lists contacts them via whatever their preferred method is to see if they want to review the meeting.|S
me013|right.|S
me018|and then if they don't you're done.|S
me018|if they do then he provides them access to the the web site.|S
me011|well to some extent i have to do that anyway because as i said we have to distribute passwords.|S
me018|or a printed out form.|S
me013|there's there|D
me011|so|F
me013|but you don't necessarily have to distribute passwords is what i'm saying.|S
me013|so|D
me011|well but|D
me018|only if they want it.|S
me011|what i'm saying is that i can't just email them the password because that's not secure.|S
me013|no no no.|S
me013|but you aren't necessarily giving them|D
me011|so they have to call me and ask.|S
me013|right.|S
me013|but we don't even necessarily need to end up distributing passwords at all.|S
mn014|huh|D
me011|well we do because of privacy.|S
me011|we can't just make it openly available on the web.|S
me013|no no.|S
me013|you're missing the point.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|D
me013|we're we're trying we're trying to make it less of an obvious just uh fall off a log to do this.|S
fe008|not everyone gets a password unless they ask for it.|S
me013|right?|Q
me013|so so what i would see is that first you contact them and ask them if they would like to review it for to check for the|D
fe008|yeah.|B
me013|not just for fun.|S
me013|okay?|Q
me013|but to to check this for uh things that they're worried about having said or if they're willing to just send an approval of it at from their memory.|S
me013|um and uh and we should think carefully actually we should review go through how that's worded.|S
me013|okay?|Q
me013|then if someone uh wants to review it uh|D
me013|and i know you don't like this but i'm offering this as a suggestion is that is that we then give them a print out.|S
me013|and then if they say that i have a potential problem with these things then you you say okay well you might want to hear this in context to think if you need that you issue them a password in the|D
me011|but the the problem with what you're suggesting is it's not just inconvenient for them it's inconvenient for me.|S
me011|because that means multiple contacts every time for every single meeting every time anyone wants anything.|S
me011|i would much prefer to have all be automatic they visit the web site if they want to.|S
me011|obviously they don't have to.|S
me013|i know you'd prefer it but the|D
me013|we have|D
me011|yeah.|B
me013|there's a problem with it.|S
me011|so i think you're thinking people are going to arbitrarily start bleeping and i just don't think that's going to happen.|S
fe008|i'm also concerned about the spirit of the of the informed consent thing.|S
fe008|because i think if they feel that uh it's i i|D
fe008|you know if it turns out that something gets published in this corpus that someone really should have eliminated and didn't detect then it could have been because of their own negligence that they didn't pursue that next level and get the password and do that.|S
fe008|um but but they might be able to argue oh well it was cumbersome and i was busy and it was going to take me too much time to trace it down.|S
fe008|so it could that the burden would come back onto us.|S
fe008|so i'm a little bit worried about uh making it harder for them from the legal standpoint.|S
me013|well you can go too far in that direction and you need to find somewhere between i think.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
me013|because|D
me011|it seems to me that sending them email saying if you have an o okay reply to this email and say okay.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
me011|if you have a problem with it contact me and i'll give you a password.|S
me011|seems like is a perfectly reasonable compromise.|S
me011|and if they want a printout they can print it out themselves.|S
fe008|or we could print it up for them.|S
fe008|i mean we could offer that.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
fe008|but but there's uh another aspect to that and that is that in the informed consent form um my impression is that they that we offered them at the very least that they definitely would have access to the transcript.|S
fe008|and and i|D
fe008|i don't know that there's a chance of really skipping that stage.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe008|i mean i i thought that you were|D
fe008|maybe i misinterpreted what you said but it's|D
me013|having access to it doesn't necessarily mean that having it.|S
me011|having it.|S
fe008|giving it to them.|S
me013|right?|Q
fe008|okay.|S
me013|it just means they have the right to have it.|S
me011|well the in|D
fe008|all right.|S
me011|the consent form is right in there if anyone wants to look at it.|S
fe008|fine.|B
fe008|okay.|B
fe008|fair enough.|S
me011|so|F
me013|yeah.|B
me011|you want me to grab one?|Q
fe008|well i could|D
fe008|i'm closer.|S
fe008|i could|D
me011|yeah but you're wired.|S
me011|aren't you?|Q
fe008|yeah.|D
fe008|that is true.|S
me013|um yeah i mean i don't want to fool them.|S
fe008|i don't know|D
me013|i just meant that every any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a a bias that is presented.|S
fe008|oh yeah yeah.|S
fe008|oh i know.|S
me013|right?|Q
fe008|yeah that's true.|S
me013|of and|D
me011|if you agree to participate you'll have the opportunity to have anything anything excised which you would prefer not to have included in the data set.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
me013|yeah.|B
me011|once a transcript is available we will ask your permission to include the data in the corpus for the larger research community.|S
me011|there again you will be allowed to indicate any sections that you'd prefer to have excised from the data base.|S
me011|and they will be removed both from the transcript and the recording.|S
fe008|huh.|B
fe008|well that's more open than i realized.|S
me011|well i mean it|D
me011|the one question is definitely clear with anything as opposed to just what you said.|S
me013|i|D
mn014|yeah.|B
me013|yeah uh no that it|D
fe008|that's true.|S
fe008|that's more severe but the next one says the transcript will be around.|S
me013|that's right.|B
fe008|and it doesn't really say we'll send it to you.|S
fe008|or it'll be available for you on the web or anything.|S
me018|i think it probably leaves it open how we get it to them.|S
me013|i|D
fe008|at least it more often.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe008|it means also we don't have to to give it to them.|S
fe008|i mean like like morgan was saying they they|D
me011|they just have to make sure that it is available to them.|S
fe008|it's available to them if they ask for it.|S
me013|yeah okay.|S
me013|so um i think i have an idea that may be may satisfy both you and me in this which is um|D
me013|it's a it we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded.|S
me013|so i i just want it to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong it gives very i mean nothing hidden very strongly the bias that we would really like to use all of these data.|S
me011|right.|B
me013|that that we really would rather it wasn't a patchwork of things tossed out.|S
fe008|good.|B
me013|that it would be better for um our uh field if that is the case.|S
me013|but if you really think something is going to|D
me013|and i don't think there's anything in the legal aspects that that is hurt by our expressing that bias.|S
fe008|great.|B
fe008|great great.|B
me013|and then then my concern about which|D
fe008|yeah.|B
fe008|i agree.|S
me013|you know you might be right it may be it was just paranoia on my part uh but people just|D
me013|see i'm worried about this interface so much fun that people start bleeping stuff out just as just because they can.|S
me011|it's just a check box next to the text it's not any fun at all.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me013|well i don't know.|S
me013|i kind of had fun when you played me something that was bleeped out.|S
me013|you know?|Q
me013|i|D
me011|well but they won't get that feedback.|S
me011|all|D
me013|oh they won't?|Q
me011|no because it doesn't automatically bleep it at the time.|S
me013|oh good.|S
me011|it just sends me|D
me013|so you haven't made it so much fun.|S
me011|right.|S
me013|oh good.|S
me013|okay.|S
me011|it just sends me the time intervals.|S
me011|and then at some point i'll incorporate them all and put bleeps.|S
me011|i mean i don't want to have do that yet until we actually release the data.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me011|because um then we have to have two copies of every meeting.|S
me011|and we're already short on disk space.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me011|so i i want to i just keep the times until we actually want to release the data and.|S
me011|then we bleep it.|S
me013|okay.|S
me013|all right so i think|D
me013|yeah so if we have if|D
me013|again let's you know sort of circulate the the wording on each of these things and get it right.|S
me013|but but|F
me011|well since you seem to feel uh strongest about it would you like to do the first pass?|Q
me013|okay.|S
me013|uh fair enough.|S
me013|turn about is fair play.|S
fe008|also there is this other question the legal question that that adam's raised uh about whether we need a concrete signature or email suffices or whatever.|S
me013|sorry.|D
me011|yeah.|B
fe008|and i don't know how that works.|S
fe008|there's something down there about if you agree to|D
me013|i'm i'm i'm i thought i i thought about it with one of my background processes.|S
me011|i don't think so.|S
me013|and i uh it's uh it's uh it's fine to do the email.|S
fe008|uh.|S
fe008|fine.|S
fe008|good.|B
me013|okay.|S
me011|yeah because they're signing here that they're agreeing to the paragraph which says you'll be given an opportunity.|S
fe008|okay.|B
me013|yeah.|B
me013|and|D
me011|and so i don't think they need another signature.|S
me013|well and furthermore i|D
me013|it's now fairly routine in a lot of arrangements that i do with people on contracts and so forth.|S
me013|that that uh if it's if it's that sort of thing where you're you're saying uh okay i agree we want eighty hours of this person at such and such amount and i agree that's okay.|S
me013|uh if it's a follow up to some other agreement where there was a signature it's often done in email now.|S
me011|right.|B
me013|so it's it's okay.|S
fe008|great.|B
me013|um|D
me011|so i guess i probably should at the minimum think about how to present it in a printed form.|S
me011|i'm not really sure what's best with that.|S
me011|the problem is a lot of them are really short.|S
fe008|well|D
me011|and so i don't necessarily want to do one per line.|S
fe008|well i|D
me011|but i don't know how else to do it.|S
fe008|i also have this|D
fe008|i i think it's nice you have it uh hearable on the on the web for those who might wonder about um the non nonverbal side.|S
fe008|i mean i i agree that our bias should be as as expressed here.|S
fe008|and but i i think it's nice that a person could check.|S
fe008|because sometimes you know you the words on a on the page come out sounding different in terms of the social dynamics if they hear it.|S
me011|huh.|B
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and i realize we shouldn't emphasize that people you know shouldn't borrow trouble.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe008|what it comes down to but|D
me011|yeah i think actually|D
me011|my opinion probably is that the only time someone will need to listen to it is if the transcript is uh not good.|S
me011|you know if if there are lots of mumbles and parentheses and things like that.|S
fe008|oh you know or what if there was an error in the transcript that didn't get detected and there was a whole uh segment against some personal|D
me011|right.|B
me011|that was all mumbled?|Q
me011|i think microsoft is|D
mn014|yeah.|B
fe008|yeah exactly.|S
mn014|oh.|D
me011|sorry transcribers.|S
fe008|or or even or even there was a a line you know about how huh uhhuh bill gates duh duh duh duh|D
me013|yeah.|B
fe008|but but it was all the words were all visible but they didn't end up there was a slip in the transcript.|S
mn014|oh god.|S
me011|they're going to hate this meeting.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
fe008|yeah that's true.|S
me011|actually liz will like it.|S
me011|know but|F
me013|liz will like it.|S
me013|we had a pretty strong disagreement going there.|S
me011|yep yep that's right.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe008|yeah.|F
fe008|so i don't know.|S
fe008|i mean i i guess we're assuming that the transcript is a close enough approximation and that that my double checking will be so close to absolutely perfect that it that nothing will slip by.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
me013|but it the|D
me013|something might sometime and they uh|D
me013|if if it's something that they said they might|D
me013|i mean you might be very accurate in putting down what they actually said.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|D
me013|but when they hear it themselves they may hear something different because they know what they meant.|S
fe008|i don't know how to notate that.|D
me018|sarcasm.|S
fe008|yeah that's right.|D
me018|how do you how do you indicate sarcasm?|Q
fe008|yeah that's right.|D
me013|no i'm serious.|S
me013|so the so the|D
me013|so we might we might get some feedback from people that such and such was you know not not really what i said.|S
me011|yeah.|B
me011|well that would be good to get definitely.|S
me013|yeah but|D
me013|yeah sure.|S
me011|just for corrections.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me011|so um in terms of password distribution i think phone is really the only way to do it.|S
me011|phone and in person.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
me011|or mail physical mail.|S
fe008|or if|D
fe008|leave it on their voice mail.|S
me018|any sub word level thing.|S
me011|any sub|D
me011|yeah okay.|B
me011|i mean you could do it with p g p or things like that but it's too complex.|S
fe008|you know i just realized something which is of this question about the uh the possible mismatch of|D
fe008|i mean|D
fe008|well and actually also the lawyer saying that um we shouldn't really have them have the people believing that they will be cleared by our checks.|S
fe008|you know?|Q
fe008|i mean so it's like in a way it's it's nice to have the responsibility still on them to listen to the tape and and hear the transcript.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe008|to have that be the|D
me013|well yeah but you can't|D
me013|i mean most people will not want to take the time to do that though.|S
fe008|yeah okay fair enough.|S
fe008|and they're they're absorbing the responsibility themselves.|S
me013|and they they have to|D
fe008|so it's not it's not um|D
fe008|yeah good.|S
me013|but i mean if you were at a meeting and and you you don't think at least that you said anything funny.|S
me013|and the meeting was about you know some some funny thing about semantics or something or uh|D
me011|you probably won't listen to it.|S
me013|yeah.|D
fe008|it is true that that the content is technical.|S
fe008|i and so and we're not having these discussions which|D
me013|yeah.|B
fe008|i i mean when i listen to these things i don't find things that are questionable in other people's speech or in my own.|S
me013|you would think it would be rare.|S
fe008|just|D
fe008|it should be very rare.|S
me013|i mean we're not talking about the energy crisis or something people have|D
fe008|yeah.|B
fe008|yeah okay.|B
me011|how about them energy crises?|Q
me013|yeah.|B
me013|i think we're uh|D
me011|done?|Q
me013|kind of done.|S
me013|actually i was going to|D
me013|did you have anything that's going on or|D
mn009|not really.|S
mn009|no.|S
mn009|um my project is going along.|S
mn009|but um i'm really just here to um fill the project uh the overall progress.|S
me013|yeah.|B
mn009|i don't really have anything specific to to talk about.|S
me013|that's fine.|S
me013|i just didn't want to go by you if you had something.|S
mn009|oh okay.|S
me013|you don't have anything to say.|S
me013|nah.|S
me018|no.|S
me011|oh.|B
me013|transcribers he was rattling the marbles in his brain back and forth just then this this|D
me011|shall we do digits?|Q
me013|oh yeah.|S
me011|um oh by the way i did find a bunch|D
mn009|it um|D
me011|uh we should count out|D
me011|how many more digits to forms do we have back there?|Q
me018|there were quite a few.|S
me011|that's what i thought.|S
me018|uh|D
me011|i i was going through them all and i found actually a lot filed in with them that were blanks that no one had actually read.|S
me018|huh.|B
me011|and so we still have more than i thought we did.|D
me018|oh good.|S
me011|so we have a few more digits before we're done.|D
