me013|okay so let's uh|D
me013|let's discuss agenda items.|S
me011|i should have brought more|D
me013|what did we have?|Q
fe008|yes.|B
me013|uh you you were announce some things.|S
me011|i have a couple things about speaker form|D
me011|about forms in general.|S
me013|okay forms is one thing.|S
me013|uh there's status on on the uh transcription discussion which will take us about thirty seconds.|S
me011|stuff.|S
me013|uh and then uh jose as usual uh the one among us who's actually doing a bunch of things on this.|S
me013|uh he has this and i think we can have some|D
me013|i was just glancing through it so i think we have something to discuss about.|S
mn005|uhhuh.|B
me013|um and um we just sent in that uh n s f pre proposal.|S
me013|but i don't think there's much to say about that except we've sent it in and we'll see what happens.|S
me013|um anybody?|Q
me013|anything?|Q
me013|anything else going on?|Q
fe008|that's it.|S
me013|no.|S
me013|okay.|S
me013|so why don't we do it in that order?|Q
me011|okay.|S
me013|go ahead.|S
me011|i uh probably should have printed out more of these.|S
me011|so one of the things that i've been doing with the digits forms is i've been adding more and more speaker specific information to them.|S
me011|and it's getting pretty crowded and you have to fill it out each time.|S
me011|so what i thought was it would be nice to have a single speaker form that you fill out once.|S
me011|and then on the digits form you just have to put your name down and you can look it up from the speaker form.|S
me011|so i had a first pass of it.|S
me011|and i spoke with jane a bit about how to specify what language and education and that sort of stuff.|S
me011|and so i have a first pass at it.|S
me011|and i was uh just wondering if people had any comments on information that should or shouldn't be on it.|S
me011|and i only did one copy which was really stupid of me.|S
me011|um so i'll just sort of say what it's on and then i can hand it around.|S
me011|so the top of it is uh name sex email or other contact information.|S
me011|and i put the contact information just in case we have people with the same name so that you can distinguish them.|S
me011|and then also just to have a separate contact from the consent form.|S
me011|and then uh we talked a little bit about whether to do how we get at the background.|S
me011|and we could do profession but it's so uniform that we figured what was more important was actually the education level.|S
me011|um at least that would get at some idea of their background.|S
me011|so i have a and|D
fe008|well and it's also relevant to status.|S
fe008|i i can insert that.|S
me011|and relevant to status.|S
mn005|uhhuh.|B
me011|so that what i have is uh|D
me018|status?|Q
fe008|which might affect the discourse aspects.|S
fe008|so go ahead.|S
me018|oh oh stats kind of status okay.|S
fe008|his|D
fe008|uhhuh yeah.|S
me011|so uh i have uh five things that you can circle.|S
fe008|categories.|S
me011|undergrad grad post doc professor and then other with a colon and a place where you can fill in if there's some other.|S
me011|so i think the problem with that is that there's not a necessarily easy equivalent for our visitors who are not used to the u s education levels.|S
me011|and may need some help to translate what that means.|S
me013|how fine a resolution do you need on that for this?|Q
mn005|is the question.|S
me013|i mean maybe not so much.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
me018|student non student.|S
fe008|oh i think undergrad is useful.|S
fe016|can you just write something like position?|Q
fe016|and people can fill in their own you know post doc or visitor or whatever.|S
me013|prone.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me018|sitting.|S
me011|well the problem with that is um i think the same as the problem of profession.|S
me011|that it it will be there will be a tendency all for everyone to put down speech researcher or or something at that granularity.|S
fe016|oh.|S
me011|so i don't think there's a problem asking the education level i at least i don't feel like there is.|S
me011|um i think the only question is whether the what categories should there be?|Q
fe008|yeah.|D
fe008|i think that|D
fe008|so uh did are were you suggesting that it should be more fine grained than this?|Q
me013|no no.|S
me013|less.|S
me011|less.|S
fe008|less?|Q
fe008|what would you suggest as a as a change?|Q
me013|um huh um well do you think there's|D
me013|i don't really know.|S
me013|i mean were you thinking uh that it would be useful for some research later to know say you said undergrad for instance so undergrad versus grad?|Q
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh.|S
me013|do you think that's important?|Q
fe008|i do and the reason is because i think that um well having been a grad student as yeah as others here at at berkeley that um i think there's almost like a quantum leap from undergrad to grad in terms of like the status.|S
me013|okay.|S
fe008|i mean i mean you notice it in various ways like simply trying to meet with a professor during office hours.|S
fe008|you know in in my department it was always the case grad students had a huge amount of different priority.|S
fe008|and were treated as equals and and helpers you know in in research uh uh uh roles and things that they that they|D
fe008|in terms of like the the social dynamics of interactions i would expect them to be less deferent.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and um maybe less assertive of their own views and things like that.|S
me013|i see.|S
fe008|i don't think that we're going to have a lot of undergrads.|S
me011|right.|S
fe008|unless we branch out to different types of meetings but|D
me018|how about you could say if you're giving a talk how likely are you to be challenged?|Q
fe008|this is the dimension.|S
fe008|well this is the dimension.|S
me011|well one of the one of the criteria i had for designing this form is that i didn't want a separate instruction sheet.|S
fe008|yeah but one one dimension.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
me011|and so we'll get to that in a moment when we talk about language also.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me011|is i did not want to have to you know come down and quiz each person and have a uh social dynamics expert being the one who's filling out the answers.|S
me011|i want it to be self evaluating.|S
me011|you can give it to them and they can understand what you're asking.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and it's non threatening.|S
fe008|i mean this this compared to you know exactly what level of professorship and and|D
me011|yep.|S
me018|well sounds like you really need to know something kind of like that.|S
me018|you need to know sort of in this meeting sort of what is your social status.|S
me011|that's a separate question.|S
me011|so we'll we'll get to that in a moment.|S
fe008|well i agree with him though.|S
fe008|i|D
fe008|yeah.|B
fe008|but i i agree that this is that the the motivation was things that could affect social dynamics in ways that are relevant to the research without being threatening to the person.|S
me018|but but but it's going to depend on who's|D
me011|and this particular form|D
me011|i know.|S
me011|so this particular form is speaker is dependent only on the speaker.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me011|not on the meeting.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
me011|you could imagine then having another form that you might want to do during a meeting to get out the relationships.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
me011|but then that's interfering with the meeting.|S
me011|so what i like about this information is you give it to them once and they fill it out once.|S
me011|and and then you have that information.|S
fe008|well and we also discussed the idea of having the separate d t d's would handle maybe specific meeting specific things that might be relevant.|S
me018|i|D
me013|d t d?|Q
fe008|uh the data so that|D
fe008|you know his x m l thing?|Q
fe008|you got the data type definition the document type definition part that it's can be used for relational things.|S
me013|oh.|S
me013|oh okay.|S
mn005|uh yeah.|D
mn005|yeah.|D
mn005|d t d.|D
fe008|yeah.|B
me018|i guess i guess it seems to me like you know i trying to deduce information about the person's status from the meeting independent form will be useless because|D
me011|not at all.|S
me011|i mean the fact that one person's an undergrad and the other's a full professor is interesting.|S
me011|so the question is how much of this information um can|D
me018|but that will depend on what the meeting's about.|S
me018|right?|Q
me011|well absolutely!|S
me018|let's say the undergrad was an expert in physics and|D
me011|but but you want to have that information.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
me011|right?|Q
me011|so if you don't have that information how are you going to do anything?|Q
me018|uhhuh.|B
me018|i guess i'm wondering how can you make a conclusion based on that if you don't know about the meeting?|Q
me013|yeah.|S
fe008|where'd this is just well you know we're we're talking at at a general level of description.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe008|you can always get more specific.|S
fe008|and it may be|D
me011|i mean so what would you suggest?|Q
me018|i don't know.|S
me018|i'm just that's why i was wondering about if you can put something about the|D
me013|right.|B
fe016|can you repeat the categories you had?|Q
mn005|yeah.|B
fe016|maybe they're fine.|S
me011|undergrad grad post doc professor other.|S
fe016|so that yeah i think that's fine except the one thing is there are a lot of icsi|D
fe016|like i don't know what i would be here.|S
fe016|just i'm not a professor.|S
fe016|i'm not a|D
fe016|so so anything that like a visitor icsi visitor or icsi|D
me011|oh that's right.|S
me011|you know i was saying professor|D
fe016|i mean a visiting researcher or whatever.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
me011|yeah when i said professor i guess what i was thinking in my mind was more p h d but not post doc.|S
me013|how about yeah how about post p h d researcher or something?|Q
fe016|so if if we can put something|D
me011|and or maybe post doc change post doc to p h d?|Q
fe016|yeah that then then i think what you have is great.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
me013|right?|Q
fe016|for for that purpose and|D
fe008|so change would we change post doc to post p h d researcher?|Q
fe016|or just|D
fe016|you could say|D
me011|because i think p h d and professor are are distinct.|S
mn005|yeah.|D
me011|aren't they?|Q
me013|yeah.|B
fe016|wait what's a p h d?|S
mn005|it's possible.|S
fe016|like if you have a p h d and you're hanging around here and you're not a professor and you're not a post doc then that's like what we are so there's a bunch of people like that.|S
me011|someone who has a p h d.|S
me013|yeah so for for me there's there's a there are people|D
me013|um this got very tricky in fact when we got involved with the spanish program actually.|S
me013|because uh when we said in our original forms post doc what we were used to from the german program and from the u s standard when you say post doc it meant somebody who had just gotten a p h d who was doing one year someplace.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
fe016|right.|B
me013|but when we did the spanish call many people said oh i want to be uh have a post doc slot and they were twenty years out.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
fe016|right.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
me013|because they were post their doc.|S
fe016|right.|B
fe016|yeah.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
fe016|so you can say post p h d researcher or if there's one more category that's sort of general like that.|S
me013|so|F
mn005|sure.|B
me013|i i i think that|D
mn005|right.|B
me013|it might be hard to do a finer thing than that because whether somebody is going to be dominant in a meeting is really i think it's going to be so clouded by everything else.|S
me013|someone who's just gotten their p h d uh could be very very uh strongly opinionated about something and somebody who's been twenty years out could be shy you know|D
me011|so maybe undergrad grad post p h d and other?|Q
fe008|uhhuh.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
fe008|that's true.|S
me013|what's other?|Q
me011|um other|D
me018|for the european.|S
fe008|it's just to allow.|S
me011|if instead of instead of instead of professor or instead of post doc?|Q
fe016|you i think you could keep professor but you could say post p h d researcher or something.|S
mn005|yep.|B
fe008|it could be it could be that's true.|S
fe016|no instead of post post doc or post p h d just wrap all the people that are post p h d and non professors together.|S
me013|so you want professor to be in a separate category.|S
me013|you think you think uh think think we|D
me011|so as i said undergrad|D
fe016|i think professors probably want it.|S
fe016|i don't care.|S
me011|undergrad grad post p h d professor other?|Q
fe016|yeah.|B
fe016|well yeah the post p h d one is the one that can be like post doc or post p h d researcher or whatever.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
fe016|yeah.|B
me011|right.|B
fe016|then it'd be fine.|S
fe016|i think it's fine.|S
me013|so i'm i'm tending to push toward simpler.|S
me013|even though i know that more detailed means more potential information for someone later who's doing research in in this area.|S
me013|i uh the the the thing making me lean toward simpler where possible is that uh the more a thing|D
me013|many of the meetings that we record uh may be the kind where we just record somebody once.|S
me013|even though we want to get a lot of data that has uh many meetings with the same people.|S
me013|and so the more forms we have and the more lines in the forms that's the more overhead for that one time thing makes it harder to do.|S
me011|well the whole reason that i'm doing it this way is is uh my experience so far has been the exact reverse.|S
me011|that|D
me013|right that's what we've done so far.|S
me011|right.|S
me013|right?|Q
me013|and so i'm saying i expect us to do both kinds.|S
me011|i guess we could have another type of form for less frequent.|S
fe016|yeah.|B
fe008|well one thing so you understand he he he wants you to do this only once for each person?|Q
me013|yes.|S
fe008|okay okay.|S
me013|so i'm saying there are going to be what i imagine once we've collected a lot of data a chunk of it will be uh the same people many times.|S
fe008|so|D
me013|and another chunk of it will be people random meetings that we got with from different people.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe008|uhhuh.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me013|and i think it's we've talked about this before it's useful to have both kinds of data i think.|S
me011|well i think that if if we're planning to do that then we should probably have another set of forms.|S
me013|okay.|S
me011|you know a single form that's the consent form and the speaker information form and not have them do digits.|S
me013|okay.|S
me018|no i like the idea of putting down the the status information.|S
me018|because i think you probably can get a lot of there can be a lot of interesting research on that.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
mn005|uhhuh.|B
me018|i'm wondering could we add something to the form that gets filled out at each meeting that would somehow|D
me011|this is a topic i want to bring up after i get through this.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me018|okay.|S
me011|so that that that's another form that i want to discuss um with the digits forms.|S
me018|well i guess i was thinking maybe you know how you were taking information off of the digits and putting it onto that?|Q
me011|so can we get|D
me011|uhhuh.|S
me018|could we put one more thing on here maybe?|Q
me011|that's what i want to talk about in a|D
me011|yeah i'm i have that as a topic also.|S
me018|okay.|S
me011|so let's finish with the speaker form speaker form and then we'll get over get over to that one.|S
me018|because you said separate forms so i thought maybe|D
me018|okay.|S
me011|so education level undergrad grad post p h d professor other.|S
me011|okay?|Q
mn005|okay.|S
me011|um and then i put optional with a big optional in parentheses age.|S
fe016|wait why is that optional?|Q
me011|because i think a lot of people are sensitive to it and won't want to write it down.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
me011|so i don't want to make them feel like they have to.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe016|i don't know.|S
fe016|it it would be very good to get age for a lot of purposes.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
fe016|i mean a lot of corpora|D
me011|uh sure but if someone doesn't want to write it down i don't want them to say you can't record me.|S
fe016|yeah so we we have these age ranges or something?|Q
me018|oh right.|S
fe008|well it|D
me013|well wait wait wait wait a minute.|S
fe016|you know like|D
me013|um it's not illegal or anything.|S
me013|right?|Q
me013|it's not pushing on anything unethical or illegal whatever to ask for their age.|S
fe016|no not at all.|S
me013|right?|Q
fe016|every most corpora have that you know information.|S
me013|so|D
me013|i suggest you ask for their age.|S
me013|and if they say i don't want to give it say okay.|S
fe008|in in like the london lund they they the researchers themselves estimate the age after the fact.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
fe008|so they say you know uh middle thirties you know fifties or sixties.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
fe008|and they and they just they estimate for the person but|D
me011|well i think that just having on the form saying optional age again means i don't have to be sitting here and explaining the form every time we do this.|S
fe016|yeah that's okay.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe008|and it isn't it isn't that|D
me011|and having a little instruction sheet and say if you're in this range do this and if you're in this rage do that.|S
me013|i see.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
me018|yeah.|B
fe008|and it's and it isn't really that prominent.|S
me011|so|F
me018|how about|D
fe008|it's you know his optional is not really boldface but|D
me018|how about optional but highly desirable?|Q
fe008|please please!|S
mn005|yeah.|B
fe016|age or approximate age.|S
fe016|so somebody can say thirties if they're thirty nine.|S
fe008|actually approximate?|Q
me013|age is optional but those who don't give it will be given the uncomfortable microphones.|S
me011|yeah right.|S
fe008|that's right.|S
fe016|well those who don't give it we will be estimating your age for you.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
me018|yeah if not given we will estimate.|S
fe016|so maybe you'll prefer to|D
mn005|i i think is not|D
me013|the the mean of the estimates from the group will be used|D
me018|yeah.|B
mn005|i think it's not necessary to put uh optional.|S
fe016|yeah people can leave it blank if they|D
mn005|i think people decide uh in that moment.|S
fe016|i i think people in speech are going to want to|D
mn005|because if you put optional i think you you give uh|D
me018|they're very strong willed.|S
me018|you know?|Q
me018|people|D
me011|well i think maybe that's because no one here is sensitive about their age.|S
fe016|they can always lie.|S
me011|but i would rather let them leave it blank than lie.|S
fe016|okay in some sense you could say that please leave blank but but don't lie.|S
me011|so that's why i want to put that's why i want to put optional age.|S
me011|so that if they don't want to put it they leave it blank.|S
me013|they might lie anyway.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
me011|but if you put optional won't they just leave it blank rather than lie?|Q
me013|i don't know.|S
me011|okay.|S
me018|i think i think you can put optional.|S
me013|i mean i mean the the people i've known who've lied about it i think would just lie about it.|S
me018|it's not going to|D
fe016|right.|S
me011|you don't think they'd just leave it blank if it says has a big optional right next to it?|Q
mn005|yeah.|B
me018|you know people who lie about it?|Q
me013|oh yeah.|S
fe016|well they might leave it blank if they didn't care about their age being known but it says optional they might not.|S
me013|hey jack benny was thirty nine for forty years.|S
fe016|anyway it's fine.|S
fe016|i don't know.|S
fe008|well the thing the reason uh one reason for putting optional might be if it uh made the form seem gentler and and not as intrusive kind of thing.|S
me013|kinder and gentler.|S
fe008|yeah i noticed i was afraid you'd i shouldn't say that.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
fe008|they uh that you know if you say optional then it's sort of|D
fe008|if people who get nervous about the age question then they realize that oh well but they're not trying to ask me lots of things.|S
me018|yeah i think it's okay.|S
me013|i don't think it matters.|S
me018|people will put it i i|D
me013|i i don't think it matters.|S
me013|if it makes you more comfortable put optional.|S
me011|it it i think it's better to put optional.|S
me013|i i don't think it's|D
fe016|okay.|S
me011|i mean that's why i put it there|D
me013|then|D
me018|okay.|S
mn005|okay okay.|D
me011|but it seems like maybe you disagree.|S
fe008|i like it.|S
fe008|i think it's softening.|S
me013|i i i don't think it's important but i also don't think it's an important point the other way.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
me013|and i don't want to make you do it some different way than you want to do it.|S
me018|yeah.|B
fe016|yeah it's okay.|S
me013|so|F
mn005|huh.|B
fe008|okay.|B
fe016|as long as we put it high enough up that it doesn't sort of get lost in the optional if there are a lot of other optional things on the form.|S
me011|well i didn't mark anything else as specifically optional.|S
fe016|that's that's the only optional thing.|S
fe008|let's see.|D
fe008|that's the only other one.|S
fe008|that's the only one.|S
fe016|okay.|S
me011|so|F
me011|um and then the next are two sections.|S
me011|one indented separately.|S
me011|so one's for native english speakers and one for non native english speakers.|S
me011|okay so for the native english speaker it asks for a variety of english with three circle boxes.|S
me011|american british indian and other for write in.|S
me013|now what was this thing that|D
me013|who was telling|D
me013|was it steve?|Q
me013|somebody was telling us about asking about uh|D
me018|where you lived between the ages of|D
me011|yep jane and i discussed this and it was it was again the same problem.|S
me011|that it's going to be a self evaluation anyway.|S
me011|and so i don't want to have to be standing over the person and asking them well do you mean that your native language was british when you were born and then it changed to american when you were two and then it changed to and so on.|S
fe008|well also you you you he has a separate subject for region.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and so it's a self assessment of what you think your closest variety is of english.|S
fe008|and then following that a characterization of of region.|S
fe008|now we discussed maybe indicating a a time frame.|S
fe008|so where did you live during your you know childhood and adolescence.|S
me011|right.|B
me018|uhhuh.|B
fe008|which would be|D
me018|which is more objective than somebody saying i think i speak this or that.|S
fe008|yes uhhuh.|S
fe008|although you know i mean a lot of people there won't be much difference.|S
me011|i mean there's room on the form to put a line of instruction but i'm just not sure what it should really be.|S
me013|i i i'm sorry so you're saying|D
fe008|but|F
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me013|uh i i i just missed something though.|S
me013|are you saying that you have both?|Q
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me013|that you're saying uh what is your|D
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me011|so the the for the non for the native english speakers we have variety of english and region.|S
me013|yeah.|S
me011|and that's it.|S
fe008|and that's partly to pick up|D
me011|and then we have another form later down which is um list other language influences.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe016|so what does region mean?|Q
me018|yeah i was just going to ask the same thing.|S
fe016|and like if i see this form i wouldn't be quite sure what you mean by region.|S
me018|region|D
me011|right neither would i.|S
fe016|do you want to have give choices and have them circle one or|D
fe016|i mean|D
fe008|well we when we when we discussed it it was it was where where you lived during your childhood and adolescence.|S
me011|um i don't think we can do that because it would be different for|D
me018|does that mean region of|D
me018|region of the u s or region of the world|D
me011|if you're american english it would be region of the u s.|S
fe008|well it's it's where you lived.|S
me018|okay.|S
me011|that that so that's why i didn't have circle forms.|S
fe016|but i mean|D
me011|because it would be different depending on what your language is.|S
me011|so|D
me018|do you mean state or do you mean more broad than the state level?|Q
me013|huh.|B
me018|you mean like you know southern u s or northeastern or|D
me011|i think it would be however you would identify your own.|S
me011|and as i said i don't really see a way of doing a circle fill in because there would be there would have to be one for american english one for british english one for you know one for each type.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me018|if you wanted to get regions for american english you could copy what they did in timit.|S
fe008|well and also|F
me018|they had divided things up into regions.|S
me011|but but that would mean i would have to do generate a different form for circles if you're american english or british english or indian english.|S
me018|no no.|S
me018|it would only be if you said american english.|S
fe016|yeah maybe not for the others because there aren't going to be enough people to really group them.|S
me018|then you'd put the regions.|S
me018|for the others you would just leave it.|S
me018|yeah.|S
me018|we wouldn't have enough to really make them difference on those.|S
fe016|and you know when you talk about dialects in england i mean that's really|D
fe008|well|F
fe016|every block of london has a different|D
mn005|huh.|B
fe016|so|F
me013|yeah.|S
fe008|i haven't seen what what they did in timit.|S
fe016|my fair lady's|D
fe008|are you do they have a bunch of options like uh|D
me018|oh it's like six regions of the country or something.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe008|i see.|S
me018|very just a limited number.|S
fe008|okay.|D
me018|and then if you're american you would just circle the region where|D
me013|yeah.|D
fe008|well that's the concept.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
me011|uhhuh.|B
me013|yeah and henry higgins could say which block you were from.|S
fe008|well|D
me013|right?|Q
me018|yeah.|S
me013|so that's|D
fe008|that's right.|S
fe008|well that you know that was the concept of having the region thing.|S
fe008|i it would be no problem to change it to options if um if that were desirable.|S
me011|yeah i just don't know what to do about the other varieties of english.|S
fe008|although for different|D
fe008|well that's true.|S
me018|you'd just leave them.|S
fe008|i mean indian english i wouldn't know|D
me018|you don't even ask.|S
fe016|i i there are huge differences you know in the others.|S
fe008|what|D
me011|well that's why i wanted to just leave it something that you could write it down.|S
fe016|so it might be better to just do it for the|D
fe016|yeah you could leave region for for the others but have circled choice for the american english.|S
me018|one one good reason to use the timit ones is if anybody asks you you know about the data later on you can say well i chose these based on timit and|D
fe016|right.|B
fe008|that is kind of nice.|S
me013|what|D
me013|what about just doing the the sort of the steve suggestion uh as as an add on to it?|Q
me013|right?|Q
me013|rather than saying region just say where did you live between the ages of here and here.|S
fe008|that was the concept of region.|S
me018|and that would apply to everybody then?|Q
me018|yeah.|F
me013|just|D
fe008|and it's just the wording of it.|S
me018|and then you could map those to the timit regions later if people wanted to.|S
mn005|uhhuh.|B
me013|and then they they could|D
me013|right yeah they could say it different ways.|S
me018|yeah.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
me018|that's more general.|S
me013|they could say cincinnati or they could say midwest or|D
me018|yeah.|B
me018|that's true.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
fe016|actually that is true for them.|S
fe016|but it means that you're going to get a bunch of different level levels of resolution in your survey it it'll be more of a pain later.|S
fe016|so|F
me013|somebody's going to have to do some data|D
me011|well there could be a circle one.|S
fe016|it depends.|S
fe008|i guess there's|D
me011|right?|Q
me011|so you could say what region did you grow up in from these years.|S
me011|and have a set of of six or seven circles|D
fe016|yeah that that's good.|S
fe016|but if you have it totally free form first of all some people take you|D
me011|yeah.|B
me018|a lot of post processing?|Q
fe016|well and some people would give you more specific information than others.|S
fe016|and that's a waste because you can only use the least common denominator of specificity and generally.|S
me013|yeah but that but the good thing about it is it is it frees you from coming up with exactly what the right categories are.|S
me013|um right?|Q
fe016|i don't know.|S
fe016|later on if if somebody just says midwest now all these other people who said you know then that'll have to become your category.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe016|and it's it's harder later on i it's easier for the person.|S
me013|i see.|S
fe008|there is another problem.|S
fe016|but it's harder for the|D
fe016|it actually less informative for us.|S
fe016|because you can't enforce any minimum level of specificity.|S
me013|but i think that if you're going to have it be general uh|D
fe016|so it's|D
me013|so the idea again was you know you might want to also know if if they grew up in germany or if they grew up|D
me013|and so uh i think you want to the idea the motivation i think for this being suggested before was that it did cover a range of these cases that might um|D
me013|you know if you say your native language was was english but uh you you grew up in germany uh i think this|D
me018|yeah there is actu you made me think about another wrinkle in this whole thing which is that just asking them where they grew up between certain ages isn't enough.|S
me018|because somebody could grow up in germany but live on an army base speaking english.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe008|yeah.|B
fe008|or someone could in in in new york and have i mean any number of different types of speech patterns.|S
fe016|or their parents live|D
fe016|yeah.|B
me018|yeah so you sort of have to say what languages were spoken in the home between the ages of|D
fe016|and their parents|D
fe008|well we have this we have to|D
fe008|so he hasn't given you the overview.|S
fe008|but you have like the native speaker category the non native speaker category.|S
fe008|and then you have other language influences for example bilingual dialects things like that.|S
me018|oh that's nice okay.|S
fe008|now there's this issue of not like you're saying you don't want the forms to be hugely complicated and take half the meeting to complete.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
fe008|so it's trying to there's this trying to trying to hold this balance between the amount of information needed.|S
fe008|and uh you know not taking too much meeting time.|S
fe008|and then in addition add to it the third level of the balance uh um this this issue of not being too intrusive asking in a way that they don't mind.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
fe016|if we release this corpus what do we want?|Q
fe016|i mean if you do this free form um the free form solution where some questions are very open ended then you need someone needs to enter that.|S
fe016|and they'll be notes and it will be very difficult for somebody later actually use that without mapping it.|S
fe008|well i think i think that we need to remember that we have first of all it's not all free form.|S
fe016|it's okay.|S
fe016|but it's|D
fe008|we have several categories that are specifically constrained.|S
fe016|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and in terms of the more open ones we have the we're in the enviable position of having the contact information and also knowing most of the people who will be participating in the meeting data.|S
fe008|we can find it we can resolve certain issues later if|D
fe016|huh.|B
me013|yeah and the question is how extensive this gets?|S
fe016|i mean i guess what you really want is if there's some information you want to know|D
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe016|so we want some rough idea of their dialect basically.|S
fe008|that's it.|S
fe016|then we should have some question where it's not free form except for these people who are who have non american english accents.|S
fe016|there we probably have to have a category non american english and then a few choices.|S
fe016|and we should have something that's simple that people can circle like these timit regions or something so that we have something that minimally you can|D
fe016|because a lot of times if you give the data out that's what people are going to use.|S
fe016|they're going to want some small set of places.|S
fe016|and then but anything additional people can fill out and we can put it in as a note or something.|S
fe016|but if we don't have that someone's got to sit there and figure out you know i've got twenty people who said midwest.|S
fe016|and i've got a few people who said something else.|S
fe016|and these don't overlap or these|D
fe008|isn't it i mean i think that we're going a little bit in a circle because i like the timit suggestion very much.|S
fe008|and i think it's a question of how to incorporate it.|S
fe008|and and we've already suggested i mean it's come up in this discussion that the suggestion that we could have um the timit categories for the american.|S
fe008|and and then make the choice or not as to whether we do it for british.|S
fe016|oh okay so|D
fe016|yeah as long as you have|D
fe008|i mean we sort of discussed one way or the other.|S
fe008|and it doesn't matter to me.|S
fe008|i don't know if adam has has a preference.|S
me013|but but|D
fe008|but we could have you know a a sub categorization for american.|S
fe008|we could even use the timit subcategorization.|S
fe008|i don't know if it has one for british or whatever.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
fe008|but you know just have it you know a short simple form that you can categorize yourself in a in a systematic way.|S
me013|what about the the phrasing that um chuck used uh which was in in relation to the question i was trying to formulate of uh where where did you what|D
me013|what was that what how did you phrase it?|Q
me011|what language was spoken in the home.|S
me013|what language was|D
me013|yeah so it's not where did you grow up but what language was spoken in the home between the ages of what would it be five and twelve or something like that?|Q
mn005|huh.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
fe008|it's a good idea.|S
me011|depends of who you ask what the age range is.|S
fe016|well in the home the influence of the home is much lower age than that.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
fe016|i mean once you go beyond the age five or six then it's the the school influence as well and and|D
fe008|and the peers.|S
fe016|yeah.|S
fe016|so in the home it's sort of your phonetic first level.|S
fe008|that's one part though.|S
fe016|um so it's you know it starts to get sort of complicated.|S
me011|yeah so this is why i|D
fe008|well it's that's not a problem though.|S
me011|so so|D
fe008|i mean that would be a good question to ask.|S
fe008|and then you could add a question.|S
fe008|you know would uh among your peers.|S
fe008|you know.|S
me013|because he does make a good point about the region.|S
fe008|specify the age range.|S
me013|not necessarily again if you're on the army base or|D
fe016|right.|S
me011|well the way it's phrased right now it's clearly asking about language.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me011|and so what it's trying to get at is what you think you speak.|S
me011|now i think that the point is well taken that sometimes people are wrong about what they think they speak.|S
fe016|right.|B
me011|but other than having a trained linguist interview them and ask these very specific questions i don't see a way around it.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
me011|because as you said what you're going to have to stay say is well list the languages that your parents spoke when you were in home and how good they were at it and how long they spoke it.|S
me011|and now list the ones in preschool.|S
me011|and now list the ones in first grade.|S
me011|and now list the ones your friends speak|D
me018|sort of like as soon as you get to the cases on the edge the complexity just shoots up.|S
fe008|yeah that's right.|S
me011|right.|S
fe016|uhhuh.|B
me011|so i want to try to keep the complexity so someone can fill out this form at the beginning of a meeting without taking uh forty five minutes.|S
mn005|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and we're|D
fe008|and then we like i said we have the enviable benefit of knowing most of these people.|S
fe008|and being able to ask them follow ups if we need to.|S
me013|for now.|S
me013|right?|Q
me013|so it's i mean again we are hoping to expand this out.|S
fe008|for now.|S
fe008|that's true.|S
fe008|washington and stuff yeah.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe008|that's true.|S
me011|so i think that adding the the timit categories is a good idea.|S
me011|because that's very easy for a person to fill out.|S
me011|but i think we still have this problem of is it going to be a self evaluation?|Q
me011|or are we going to ask them what was it when you were four years old or what was it when you were six years old or what|D
me011|what's the best way of phrasing the question?|Q
me018|well you know the other thing too is that it seems like one of the reasons you would gather real detailed information about their native language is if you were going to do fine grained phonetic analysis or something.|S
me018|and i don't|D
fe008|well it's|D
me013|and somebody might.|S
me011|or or adaptation.|S
fe016|most of but most of those people don't rely on the self evaluations anyway.|S
me018|well that's what i was going to ask.|S
me018|is that|D
fe016|they'll probably listen to the speech.|S
fe016|so|F
fe008|well i you know i i was thinking of it as|D
fe008|that's a good point.|S
fe008|but i was thinking uh you know with reference to the language model issue which uh|D
fe008|and i guess it could be done inductively.|S
fe008|but if you have a bunch of say r less dialects and uh you know if they|D
fe016|but even you know in switchboard i i remember looking really carefully at|D
fe016|they have information sort of like timit.|S
fe016|i don't know it's how well they categorized.|S
fe016|but they had north atlantic mid atlantic and|D
fe016|you know texas was definitely out on|D
fe016|i mean most of the people from certain places in the south were from specific texas locations.|S
fe016|but other than that you had a huge range of|D
fe016|you know people would say boston and they had nothing like what i would call a boston accent.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe016|so it was|D
fe008|interesting.|S
me018|were they putting down where they lived at the moment they recordings were made?|Q
me018|is that why?|Q
fe016|um no the question was really geared towards trying to get people's self evaluation of their dialect region.|S
me018|rather than where they grew up?|Q
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me018|huh.|B
fe008|but you have a lot of stratification in any region.|S
fe016|and you know for instance you know minnesota midwest is totally different than michigan midwest which is totally|D
me018|yeah.|B
me013|right.|B
fe008|interesting.|B
fe016|these were all settled by very different type people.|S
fe016|so it it's sort of a general help.|S
fe016|but i think that anyone who's doing phonetics wouldn't rely on that they would probably use it as a first pass or something.|S
me018|so then we probably don't need the fine grained information.|S
me011|well maybe should we just|D
me011|then maybe we shouldn't just shouldn't ask.|S
fe016|well i think we do need to make sure about the the non native accents because those are you know|D
me018|yeah.|S
fe016|but we don't need to be really really specific about the others because it won't be very helpful anyway.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
me011|well maybe for the native english speakers we shouldn't even ask the region if it's that unreliable.|S
fe016|i think we should because other databases do.|S
fe016|it's sort of a political thing.|S
fe016|and there are some general|D
fe016|like you will find more new yorkers in the new york category.|S
fe016|but it's not|D
me018|it can't be relied on only.|S
fe016|right.|S
me011|the other thing also is that i'm asking for the variety of english and i did just put american british indian and other.|S
me011|so i didn't put canadian australian and all the other varieties.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe016|but other is there and people will fill that out.|S
me011|but do you think those three are okay?|Q
fe016|they'll see by example.|S
fe016|yeah that's i think that's fine.|S
me018|yeah i think those are good.|S
me011|okay.|S
fe016|they'll say oh i'm not one of these.|S
fe016|i'm canadian or|D
me013|yeah.|B
me013|so internally we have texas and other.|S
mn005|huh.|B
me011|so that for the native english speakers we'll do variety of english regions from the timit labels and another field.|S
fe016|right.|B
fe016|i mean even like l a is totally different than|D
me011|and then|D
fe016|i mean you really can't um|D
fe008|well|F
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe016|we could ask them for more information but i don't think it's necessary and it's not going to solve this problem.|S
me011|i thought this was be fast.|S
me018|yeah.|B
fe008|well that's what the final the the third category was designed to do.|S
fe008|because i mean you have a bunch of different types of accents in new york.|S
fe008|you know.|S
fe008|native speaking new yorkers as a as a function of their social uh groups and their ethnic identifications and their you know.|S
fe016|oh yeah.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe008|there are lots of things that are very identifiable as um you know other other aspects which is why we have this third category.|S
mn005|uhhuh.|B
fe008|so we wanted to certainly distinguish american versus british and other types at that level.|S
fe008|and then allow people to self identify if there are other specific things.|S
fe008|and then in addition this issue of regions with some sort of time frame for the region because i think that if you live in massachusetts now versus you know in childhood and adolescence|D
fe008|so if you if if you|D
me011|air conditioning.|S
fe008|you know.|S
fe008|so region with respect to a time frame is what i would suggest.|S
fe008|where did you live.|S
fe008|i mean what you said.|S
fe008|you know where where where did you live.|S
fe008|or uh what you were saying languages in the home.|S
fe008|but i think that uh a time frame on the region would be useful.|S
fe008|instead of region now say it's a little bit unbounded.|S
me013|um so are you suggesting that you put something in about childhood in there?|Q
fe008|well you know there's this issue of of what age is relevant for the formation of your speech patterns whatever they are.|S
me013|well you could distinguish between pre five and five five to twelve.|S
fe008|and oh that's interesting.|S
me013|right?|Q
me013|so depending on what someone's interest was in the formation of the phonetic kinds of categories or whether or whether you're talking more about their linguistic speech patterns.|S
me013|you know uh|D
me013|so|F
me013|but again it depends how fine we want to get.|S
me013|but we could say uh where did you live before you were five.|S
me013|where did you live after you were five.|S
me013|i don't know.|S
fe008|oh that's interesting.|S
fe008|from five to fifteen or something is a|D
me013|yeah.|B
fe016|i mean i think the question on regions is really to ask people how did they define their dialect region now.|S
fe016|whether they picked it up at the one age or another.|S
fe016|pretty much i mean most people will know whether they have a southern accent or not.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe016|um but they may have lived you know in other places too.|S
fe016|so if we ask the question about dialect regions it makes no sense to say where do you live now.|S
me011|right.|S
fe016|right?|Q
fe016|you ask how would you best define your your accent or your dialect style.|S
me013|right.|S
me011|right the way the way the form reads now i think it's pretty clear that's what we're asking because it says native english speakers variety of english american british indian other region.|S
fe016|okay.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me011|and then we'll have southern english you know whatever whatever the timit categories are.|S
me011|so i think if you look at this|D
fe016|or you could say to somebody how do you define your your the accent that you have.|S
me011|right.|S
fe016|um and then you can ask these other questions as well.|S
fe016|but what we don't want them to think is that they're living in a certain place.|S
fe016|and that therefore they're|D
fe016|i mean nowadays hardly anybody from california has a native californian accent.|S
me013|right.|B
fe008|yeah.|F
fe008|well i i|D
fe008|okay.|F
fe016|so|F
fe008|i don't think it was ever the intent to talk about the region now.|S
fe008|because|D
me011|right so i it seems to me that if you read this form i it's pretty obvious that it's a subcategory of the language that you think you speak.|S
fe016|okay.|S
fe008|it's it's a sub categorization.|S
fe016|as long as it's clear.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me011|not where you live.|S
me011|i mean i don't say anything about where you live on the form.|S
fe016|okay.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe016|okay.|B
me013|okay.|S
me011|so it's just in the section talking about language.|S
fe016|okay.|S
me013|why don't we try it out and see see what kind of responses we get from people.|S
me011|yeah.|B
fe016|yeah.|B
me013|anyway|D
me011|and then uh as jane said the last question is list other language influences bilingual dialects et cetera.|S
me011|and that's just and open ended place for them to do.|S
fe016|oh.|B
fe016|uhhuh.|B
fe016|sounds good.|S
fe008|that's to handle that unusual percent or two.|S
me011|and then|D
fe008|yeah.|B
me011|and then the bottom of the form is for not for them to fill out but for us to fill out for um the aliases and database speaker database that the person is in since we'll eventually anonymize.|S
me011|and this will be a a place for us to connect the two.|S
me011|and then the meetings that they attended.|S
fe016|uhhuh.|B
me011|because there'll be one form for each person.|S
fe016|sounds good.|S
fe008|it's very efficient.|S
me011|okay so|F
me011|yeah i guess i'll fiddle around yet again with the language stuff.|S
me018|i don't think you really have to do all that much.|S
me013|yeah.|S
fe016|it it gets into a can of worms.|S
fe008|well you|D
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe016|i mean the more you ask the more you realize that you're not getting great answers to what you're asking and|D
me018|yeah.|S
me018|right yeah.|S
fe008|well you didn't really talk about the non english speaker categories.|S
fe016|so|F
me011|right.|S
me011|so there's another area which is non native english speakers which asks for native language region and variety of english.|S
me011|and that's it.|S
fe008|because it used to be that germans would learn british english and now i think there's you know is a certain percentage of them who who've to tend toward american english.|S
fe016|what about proficiency in english as well?|Q
me011|proficiency.|S
me011|that's a good idea.|S
me013|uh i|D
fe008|that's hard though for self identification|D
fe016|i|D
fe016|you don't want to do it for political reasons?|Q
mn005|huh.|B
fe016|i mean i'm i wasn't thinking about that.|S
fe016|i was just thinking gee i'd like to know actually|D
me013|i wasn't thinking|D
me013|oh no no.|S
me013|i wasn't thinking political at all.|S
fe016|oh okay.|S
me013|i was just saying looking at applications of people over the years for post docs here.|S
me013|they're generally not very good at assessing their own abilities.|S
me011|well do you think that's that's also because they know that it's a important for them to be good at it.|S
me013|but|D
fe016|okay.|S
fe008|i agree.|S
me013|that could be.|S
me011|so don't don't you think they overrate rather than underrate?|Q
me013|that could be.|S
me013|yes.|S
fe016|well so maybe that's|D
me011|so but|D
me011|no i think proficiency is actually a good thing to have on this sort of form.|S
fe016|maybe we maybe we shouldn't ask it.|S
me011|the the question are what are what would the categories be?|Q
fe016|i don't know.|S
fe008|well i'd|D
fe008|i'd have to i i'd want to relate it back to training.|S
me013|good.|S
me013|bad.|S
fe008|how many years did you study english.|S
fe008|or you know have you lived in the america in a an english country before.|S
fe008|but it seems like that's so|D
fe008|i mean i think that you know if a person who|D
fe016|what about something like how comfortable are you in a meeting conducted in english?|Q
fe016|or how easy is it for you?|Q
fe016|or something like that where it's|D
me013|how how about how long have you been uh in in an english speaking country?|Q
fe016|yeah that's a good one.|S
mn005|yeah.|D
fe008|that'd be okay.|S
mn005|yeah.|S
fe016|something|D
fe016|what do you think?|Q
fe016|what's it|D
mn005|is better.|S
fe016|i mean|D
mn005|i think it's better.|S
fe016|how|D
fe016|yeah?|Q
fe016|how long have you been in an english speaking country.|S
mn005|yeah.|S
fe016|okay.|S
fe008|yeah i like that.|S
fe008|i like that.|S
fe008|that's that's non threatening and it's also an a good indicator.|S
me013|yeah.|S
fe008|and there are people who haven't ever lived in an english speaking country and who are superb.|S
fe008|however um that's you know i do think it's a pretty good indicator.|S
mn005|huh.|B
me018|and then there will be people who live in an english speaking country but all their meetings are held in another language.|S
fe008|that's true too.|S
fe008|or even you know i mean some people who just don't change much in their|D
me018|so|F
mn005|yeah.|B
me011|yeah i'm i don't know.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
me018|yochai's company is like that.|S
me011|being totally monolingual i'm not the right person to ask to talk about this.|S
me018|everybody speaks hebrew.|S
me013|really?|Q
me011|but it just seems to me that that doesn't the length of time doesn't really get at what we're asking.|S
me011|right?|Q
me011|it seems to be that asking about the proficiency even if it's self rated is what we want to know.|S
fe008|except that you have some many biasing factors.|S
me013|yeah.|S
fe008|you have you have people who are highly confident when they really should be a little bit less confident.|S
fe008|and then you have uh other people who are just the reverse and and it|D
me013|yes.|S
fe008|so many things that vary i|D
fe008|and also we want to keep it simple and non evaluative.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
me011|okay.|S
me013|we done?|Q
me011|with that form.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me013|oh there's another form.|S
me011|shall we wait for other forms later or you keep going more form|D
me013|no you got what's the other form?|S
me011|uh the other form is a modified digits form.|S
me011|uh and it's pretty this one's pretty simple.|S
me011|it's it's very much what like the digits forms in front of us except it doesn't ask for sex or native language.|S
me011|um so it's name email time date seat session mike number channel mike type.|S
fe008|why do we need that much information?|Q
fe008|why do we need the email address for example?|Q
me011|uh in case people have the same name.|S
fe008|oh i see.|S
fe008|how often would that happen?|Q
me013|in case people what?|Q
me011|so i wanted|D
me011|have the same name.|S
me013|oh.|S
me011|yeah i'm particularly sensitive to this because a good friend of mine in in seattle was named scott smith and there were fourteen of them in at boeing.|S
fe008|i see.|S
me011|so we could drop email.|S
fe008|so the only so|D
me011|i mean that's not a big deal.|S
me011|it's just uh|D
fe008|well it's an it's an interesting identifier i i now that i realize the the reason for it.|S
fe008|the that's true too.|S
me013|well the other thing is that potentially if this is done over a period of time someone's email could change.|S
me011|right.|S
me011|well the other way i was thinking about it was assigning them an i d.|S
fe008|yeah.|D
me011|but i hate it when people do that to me.|S
me011|when they say here's you i d.|S
me011|don't forget it.|S
me013|oh yeah that's bad.|S
me011|so i i wanted just something that would give us a hint of who the person is if the name field isn't readable or it's a duplicate.|S
me013|thanks.|D
fe008|that's interesting.|S
fe016|how about their birthday?|Q
fe008|good idea.|S
fe016|i don't know.|S
fe016|i mean not not the year not the year.|S
fe008|it's the age question again.|S
me011|your mother's maiden name mother's maiden name.|S
me013|oh i see.|S
me013|then you don't have to ask the age.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe016|not the year but just their birthday.|S
mn005|not the year.|S
fe016|i don't know.|S
fe016|what are the chances of people having the same name?|Q
me011|social security number.|S
fe008|yeah that's right.|S
fe008|and a bank where you frequent|D
fe008|yeah.|B
me018|pin.|S
fe016|they|D
me013|social social security number.|S
mn005|the pin!|S
me011|so although the email email will change i think that's a good way of doing it.|S
fe008|yeah.|D
me011|we'll be able to backtrack from email.|S
fe008|i like that.|S
fe008|i never thought of that as an identifier.|S
fe008|that makes sense.|S
me011|um and then the other thing i was thinking about and it probably wouldn't be on the digits form.|S
me011|but it it is something that some form about the individual meeting.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
me011|now the problem i have with that is i don't know who would be filling it out.|S
fe008|well that i think someone internal to the meeting could do after the fact.|S
fe008|and this would and and we discussed this.|S
fe008|this is with reference to like the d t d.|S
fe008|what you would put in the d t d that's meeting specific?|Q
fe008|so and it could be something like oh by the way the guy giving the presentation today is the student of the professor who you know|D
fe008|whatever.|S
fe008|so speaker a is his professor and they and he's preparing for his quals or some such thing like that.|S
fe008|or it could be you know so-and-so and so-and-so are married.|S
mn005|huh.|B
me011|just to pick up an arbitrary an example.|S
mn005|so-and-so and so|D
fe008|we this wouldn't be relevant all the time.|S
fe008|but you know if there's a big discussion on you know the the um best way to move house then and these people are talking a whole lot then it might be interesting information to say oh by the way they're married or|D
fe008|i i don't mean uh you know.|S
me011|right.|F
me011|so so the sorts of questions i had were one who's going to fill it out and who's going to take responsibility for filling it out in each meeting?|Q
me011|i mean will we will we require it?|Q
fe008|i would tend to leave that spontaneous.|S
fe008|i think that at the stage of uh uh scanning the transcripts after they've been produced by by our by i b m at that point i think that some of these dynamics will appear to be important.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
me011|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and you could you could spend a lot of time enumerating all the different relationships that people have.|S
me011|and that was my other question which is um what sort of information do we want to record?|Q
fe008|yeah.|B
me011|i mean so i think pairwise relationships are pretty easy.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me011|you know source destination relation.|S
me011|are there other sorts of things that might we might want to record?|Q
fe008|well i i was just thinking with reference to uh things that have that bear on the content or the status relations would be the things|D
fe008|without being exhaustive by any means.|S
fe008|but just like i said if there's a a certain topic that comes up in the meeting and that knowing their relationship will clarify it or if there's a certain dynamic that comes up|D
fe008|so i mean a person is asked a whole bunch of questions more than you'd usually think they'd be asked.|S
fe008|and it turns out it's because he's being prepared for a job interview or something like that then it's useful to know that that relationship.|S
me011|right.|B
me011|i think that fits in well with the whole meeting map mapping meetings concept is that's another way of looking at looking at it.|S
fe008|but not to be exhaustive.|S
fe008|interesting.|S
me011|so are there anything other than pairwise?|Q
fe008|oh well yeah you could have people who are all part of the same football league or uh or chess club or|D
me011|oh yeah okay.|S
fe016|so isn't this an open ended like basically a notes column?|Q
fe016|i mean you can imagine wanting you should be able always to attach some notes to|D
me011|yes shirt certainly.|S
fe016|is this the the place where we would do that or is there another place?|Q
me011|i've been i it seems to be that there is we could attach more structure if we wanted to.|S
me011|especially because a lot of these relationships are pairwise power relationships.|S
me013|maybe i was missing something maybe.|S
me013|but i mean this is something one would try to infer.|S
me013|but how do how would you how would you freeze that information about what uh|D
me013|i mean we already have these things about someone's a professor and someone's a student or something.|S
me013|but would you would you some person would be writing okay this person was leading the meeting and that was or or|D
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me013|is that what you mean or|D
me013|what what what uh|D
me011|um just as an example it would be source adam janin destination morgan relationship advisor.|S
me013|oh so you're just putting preexisting relationships that are|D
me011|that are relevant.|S
fe016|i think that starts to there's definitely some clear cases.|S
me013|i see.|S
fe016|but there are a lot of gray areas where the context happens just in that meeting.|S
me013|yeah.|S
me011|yep.|D
fe016|or|D
fe016|i mean where you don't want to sort of have to make a distinction between a pre existing relationship or|D
me013|yeah i|F
fe008|well realize this was the idea was that this would be meeting specific.|S
fe008|otherwise they would it would be possible to have a higher level thing.|S
fe016|but i mean there are some that generalize over many meetings and there are some that don't and there are some things that happen in between meetings.|S
me013|right but that example was not|D
fe008|that's true that's true.|S
me011|right so my example was not a good one because that's|D
me013|yeah.|B
me013|so i mean for today for instance.|S
fe016|and|D
me013|this is the second meeting recorded today.|S
me013|the first meeting was a was a front end meeting.|S
me013|and in that one the basic form of that was uh i was the leader.|S
me013|and i was saying uh what are the results you've gotten in the last week.|S
me013|and they were and uh one person was sort of taking the lead in describing what the results were.|S
me013|and then uh chuck was taking the role of saying well what did you mean by that.|S
me013|so he was sort of like the semi outsider asking curiosity questions.|S
me013|and then it would come back to me with saying well you know you showed me that but you know i think you should do this in the future.|S
me013|so it was very much sort of leader and and and and led sort of relationship.|S
me013|and um the guy i was primarily doing this with uh is is a visiting researcher uh in this meeting uh you are my graduate student.|S
me013|but uh it's not taking that kind of role at all.|S
me013|right?|Q
me011|right.|S
me013|you're you're you're actually leading the meeting for the most part most of this meeting.|S
me011|well it's just because it's my turn.|S
me013|so it's|D
me013|yeah well whatever.|S
me013|so uh yeah so i i don't know.|S
me013|so you're suggesting|D
fe016|i think this one needs to be open ended.|S
fe016|completely open ended.|S
fe016|and the only concern i would have is if there's something we want to be able to say and we can't put it in that field.|S
fe008|well there's i mean.|D
fe008|i you you're the expert on the d t d's.|S
me011|well the d t d's mean we can do whatever however we want it.|S
fe008|but|D
fe008|yeah.|B
me011|but what i what i was thinking uh the reason that i didn't want to make it completely open ended is that it does seems like there is some structure which is common.|S
me011|especially with these pairwise ones where you can describe them and pairwise.|S
fe016|so you mean like|D
me011|and you might want a tool that used that information.|S
fe016|is there a way that we can add keywords or|D
fe016|i don't know what you would call them but little labels for things that we decide are useful things to have?|Q
me011|sure absolutely.|S
fe016|but you know as long as we have this one place where it can all be stored then we're fine i think.|S
me013|right because it seems like it's sort of a|D
fe016|and those will probably occur i mean to us we'll think of a few of them some other researcher will think of some totally different keyword.|S
me011|right.|B
me013|exactly.|F
me013|it's sort of a research question you you're analyzing the meeting and you're deciding uh there's this kind of structure to it.|S
fe016|yeah it's it's it's going to change.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe016|it's going to change.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
fe016|and maybe we want to regroup things under different labels later|D
mn005|interesting.|S
fe016|if we figure out that these pairwise things are|D
me011|right well i think being being in a common organization was one i hadn't thought of that|D
fe008|well|D
me011|so you're football league was a good one.|S
me011|so the ones i've been thinking of are all sort of uh power responsibility.|S
me011|i guess husband wife is yet another one.|S
fe008|and so you know in discourse analysis you get things like the role.|S
me011|ach!|S
fe008|you have you have a role in relationships and it has to do with your negotiating your how you're perceived and how and how the other|D
me011|huh.|B
mn005|role yeah.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
fe008|you know and so there are various things you negotiate.|S
fe008|and i'm i'm wondering if we might be able to do it in sort of a loose way but with by having a searchable field like role.|S
fe008|and then you know within this context this person has the following roles and it could be very loose.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
fe008|but then it would be possible to do something as simple as a grep across a database.|S
fe008|and if you're interested in you know which which which ones this person serves as an advisor in and versus you know a uh uh whatever a leader speaker whatever you could just grep for role and and you know some some particular value.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
me013|so it sounds like having the facility is great.|S
mn005|uhhuh.|B
me013|and then over a period of time as the research happens on this we might develop some of these categories that would be generally useful.|S
me011|some more.|S
me013|and it it sounds like a good thing to do.|S
fe008|and|D
me011|okay.|S
fe008|interesting good.|F
fe008|and systematize also maybe the encoding of it if as we find some are useful and some are not so useful.|S
me011|nope.|B
me011|yeah so what i have right now is all pairwise.|S
mn005|uhhuh.|B
me011|so that's probably not sufficient.|S
fe008|i think you don't need to have that much structure built in and that would be less time consuming to do it this way first and then find out what structure's needed.|S
me011|yeah maybe not.|S
me011|yep okay.|B
me018|what about all of the meetings that have been recorded so far that without this?|Q
me018|will will somebody go back and fill that in or we just won't have it or|D
me011|well i think that in a lot of the meetings people won't be filling this out anyway.|S
me011|so really what i want to have is a place that if a researcher wants that information they can add it.|S
me018|huh.|B
me013|almost all of the meetings that we have are recorded with roughly this group.|S
me011|right.|B
me013|uh and uh you know and a fair minority with the group that we have in the morning.|S
me013|so this is not a lot of people.|S
me013|we could easily there's just a couple other meetings that|D
me011|right.|B
me011|so it we can regenerate a lot of this information.|S
me018|so it wouldn't be that hard to go back and|D
me018|yeah.|B
me013|yeah.|B
me011|but even if we can't generate it i think it's all right to have some of the sections in your database blank that this information was not collected for this meeting.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
me011|and there's just not going to be a way around that.|S
me011|that's just going to happen.|S
me011|like the n s a meeting the networks meeting.|S
me011|i don't think they're going to want to fill out that information.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me011|so|F
me011|okay enough on forms.|S
me013|okay so we're running kind of late.|S
mn005|okay.|B
me013|so we'll probably want to zip through some other things maybe do some more time on on jose's stuff later.|S
me013|um uh status of transcription.|S
me013|uh i guess you know we we recently woke up um our friends.|S
me013|and uh|F
me013|so i i guess you've sent off this the uh c d roms.|S
me013|and you got some response from from uh i b m about|D
me011|they haven't received them yet.|S
me011|but i did get a response from them saying yes we're still alive.|S
me011|we haven't done anything yet basically.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me011|and uh|F
me013|was there some suggestion that they might soon or|D
me011|yeah.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me011|so so they've transferred the responsibility to someone else.|S
me011|i can't remember his name.|S
me013|mccoond.|S
me011|mccoond?|Q
me013|yeah.|S
me011|something like that.|S
me011|but uh|F
me011|and so he sent me email and said he's going to be starting to work on it.|S
me011|and i haven't received anything else.|S
me013|great okay.|S
me011|so|F
me013|well that was that one.|S
mn005|uhhuh.|B
me013|um|F
me011|so tomorrow i'll send a email and just ask if he received it.|S
me011|he should be getting it today.|S
me011|actually he should have gotten it yesterday.|S
me011|but give him a day.|S
me013|um and i think we should just sort of look at this thing from you off line jose.|S
me013|because it's getting kind of late.|S
mn005|yeah.|S
me013|but i mean i think the bottom line just glancing through it is that there's there's a lot of overlap in just energy related things.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
me013|and so you need something else.|S
me013|i mean that's sort of|D
mn005|okay.|S
me013|right?|Q
me013|and uh what the so i'd|D
me018|what about that error that that uh the the supposed|D
me013|the residual error?|Q
me018|no the supposed bug that was that we were|D
me018|we were guessing you had a bug before.|S
me018|because you went through and you concatenated all of these things together|D
fe008|uhhuh.|B
mn005|uh yeah yeah.|S
mn005|i i found the error and i repeated the experiments.|S
mn005|uh and here uh you can find the new results uh with|D
me018|uh.|S
me013|okay so this is post bug fix.|S
mn005|yeah yeah.|B
mn005|okay?|D
me013|good okay.|S
me013|so um so i had two thought just glancing through this.|S
me013|so one is one is that um that uh we might want to talk about normalization.|S
me013|i mean i don't know what normalizations you use.|S
me013|sometimes things have more overlap before you've done some kind of normalization.|S
me013|and we might think about what different kinds of normalizations are possible.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
me013|and the other thing is that if that isn't uh so much of the issue then probably|D
mn005|yeah.|B
me013|i mean residual l p c energy and just plain energy are very closely related even though they're different.|S
me013|and um so um you really may need to go to something that looks at in some sense harmonicity or um um relationship to or fit fit to pitch tracks on uh on either side of of it for instance.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
me011|huh.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
me013|you know so if if there's uh a really bad fit between where the pitch is going in this suppose uh hypothesized region of overlap and the the and one or the other uh side you know then this this this might uh suggest a|D
mn005|another side.|S
mn005|an alteration in in the tracking way.|S
me013|excuse me?|Q
mn005|you mean that uh you um huh|D
mn005|i understand that uh you you mean uh to to study the alteration between the the tracking of the pitch uh if we compare the overlapping zone with a speaker zone.|S
me013|if you have two if you have two if you have uh two people speaking uh and there's an overlap then i mean the first thing is that there should be a mixture of harmonics uh during overlapped voice sections anyway.|S
mn005|in the in the context.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
mn005|uhhuh.|B
me013|and um the any a measure that you have of how much of the energy is due to your best guess at a particular harmonic sequence it's also going to be a smaller fraction.|S
me013|this is you know related to the harmonicity sort of thing.|S
mn005|uhhuh.|B
me013|and then the other thing i'm saying is that if you look at the temporal evolution of the pitch there should be something like a discontinuity there.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
me013|now there's other places where you'll have discontinuities in pitch and speech.|S
me013|but but maybe it'll have something to have a different character.|S
me013|but it seems like energy energy tells you something.|S
me013|but uh if unless this is a normalization problem it looks from your results like there's so much overlap that certainly you need something that isn't energy like in addition to it at least.|S
mn005|uhhuh.|B
mn005|okay.|S
me018|are are the things in the|D
mn005|i don't normalicized uh in these experiments by the moment.|S
mn005|i don't normalicize.|S
me013|okay so the question is is would some kind of normalization help?|S
mn005|yeah.|B
me013|you know uh it could be that if you normalized uh by the overall um energy uh for uh you know some some longer period of time or something uh that that there would be more of a distinction.|S
mn005|nnn.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
mn005|the different zone.|S
me013|uh i i don't know.|S
me018|so uh from from these charts are|D
mn005|yeah.|B
me018|huh i'm just trying to remember where we were.|S
me018|but uh were you were interested in finding out if you can tell the difference between overlap and single speakers by looking at the energy?|Q
me018|like say for example the mean of the energy.|S
me018|was that the idea?|Q
mn005|yeah.|S
me018|okay.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
me018|so if you look at on this page that has uh frame energy.|S
me018|you look at the mean for the overlap that's forty four point sixty two versus the mean for the speakers thirty nine point sixty two.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
me018|so there seems to be more energy when there's overlapping which makes sense.|S
me013|which is the intuition.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
me013|unfortunately there's a standard deviation of like ten.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
me018|but|D
mn005|yeah.|B
me018|yeah.|B
fe008|oh.|B
me013|so for each one|D
mn005|the product of the deviation is the is the variance.|S
me018|different than standard deviation.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me018|yeah.|B
fe016|but are we assuming that you could know the energy for a speaker when there's no overlap?|Q
fe016|i mean i can imagine a model where you say okay you know i'm i'm going to give myself|D
me011|and and and did is this from the mixed signal?|Q
fe016|it's cheating.|S
fe016|but not completely if they're often not overlapping and normalized for the speaker.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
fe016|or is that not allowed?|Q
fe016|i mean what's the|D
me013|well that's what i was suggesting that you want to do some kind of longer time normalization uh with the|D
mn005|yeah.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
mn005|but|D
me013|even if you make a mistake occasionally that that is roughly is there some corresponding to that speaker so that if you if if uh if you|D
fe016|right.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
me013|because that that's going to spread out these distributions really a lot to not do any kind of normalization.|S
fe016|right.|B
me013|and so that that could mask the effect somewhat.|S
me018|so the um just one more clarifying question.|S
me018|on the overlap category is that overlapping of speakers only?|Q
mn005|yeah.|S
me018|it doesn't include some of the other sounds?|Q
mn005|no.|S
me018|okay.|S
mn005|it's a pure overlapping zone.|S
me013|so that's why it doesn't add up down.|S
mn005|i mean that uh overlapping between two three four uh uh speaker.|S
me018|okay.|S
me018|okay.|S
mn005|yeah.|S
me011|okay so there is some normalization already in that they've been volume equalized uh over the entire signal.|S
fe016|right right.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
fe016|right.|B
fe016|that's what makes it seem difficult.|S
mn005|because they they're|D
fe016|because you're already left with a high standard deviation.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
fe016|and they're already roughly|D
fe016|so that each person's hearable.|S
fe016|right?|Q
fe016|sort of equally loud perceptually anyway.|S
me011|right.|S
me011|right.|S
fe008|what about doing it with just the single channels?|Q
mn005|sorry?|Q
fe008|what about|D
fe008|uh|F
mn005|say this graphic?|Q
fe008|well i i'm thinking so they're raising the question about the fact that if you use the mixed signal there's already been a|D
mn005|yeah.|F
mn005|i use the mixed signal without normalization without normalization.|S
me011|well but the mixed signal already has a normalization in it.|S
fe008|i i'm|D
mn005|but but|F
fe008|exactly.|S
fe008|so what i'm wondering is what about doing some of this with the single channel recordings.|S
mn005|uh.|S
mn005|i i don't study the single channel yet.|S
mn005|but uh is uh is an idea.|S
me011|well i think it'll be worse.|S
me011|right?|Q
me011|i think the mixed|D
mn005|to to begin to work with the uh with the single channel now.|S
me013|i have another another thought.|S
me013|um this is this is frame energy.|S
me013|of course frame frames have a lot of variance to them.|S
me013|because different sounds are different loudnesses.|S
me013|so i mean what if you took uh one second chunks or something like that?|Q
mn005|yeah.|D
me013|or or maybe not even a second.|S
me013|maybe a quarter of a second or something.|S
me013|so that you would typically have two or three basically syllable kind of length|D
fe016|yeah like two hundred milliseconds.|S
me013|yeah.|S
fe016|or twenty to twenty five frames.|S
me013|right.|S
me011|or window it.|S
fe016|or|F
mn005|yeah.|B
me013|so then you you'll you know|D
me011|hamming window.|S
me013|something.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
me013|yeah.|S
me013|so so i mean so you know two hundred three hundred four hundred|D
me013|some longer chunk of time.|S
me013|and then you looked at the amount of energy in that.|S
me013|and how does that vary over these different cases?|Q
mn005|uhhuh.|B
fe016|or voiced regions.|S
fe016|i mean can we tell?|Q
me013|or voiced regions.|S
fe008|interesting.|S
fe016|can we sorry i mean is it known whether something's voiced here or is it roughly estimate estimateable?|Q
me013|well i mean you could do a you could first determine that something was voiced or not.|S
fe016|i mean like if one speaker's voicing and the other one isn't and they're overlapping do we know that the first speaker's voicing or not?|Q
me013|well i mean the overlaps are typically more than just a tiny little bit of time.|S
mn005|uh.|B
me013|and so uh there could be voiced and non voiced pieces during the overlap.|S
me011|huh.|B
fe016|uhhuh.|S
fe016|but will we be able to detect the voicing when there's overlap?|Q
fe016|that's what i just wondered.|S
me013|i don't know.|S
me013|because it's it's this this has to do with these questions of harmonicity and so forth.|S
fe016|okay.|S
fe016|so if we could or if you could do some of it|D
mn005|yeah.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
fe016|yeah.|B
mn005|yeah.|S
me013|right?|Q
fe016|then um voiced regions would be like probably more informative for energy.|S
me013|yeah.|F
fe016|because|D
me013|right so you could do something like uh|D
fe016|and and pitch for that matter.|S
me013|but|D
me013|sure.|S
me013|but i think what will be easy for him to do would be to do this thing of looking over a large enough region of time.|S
me013|because if you look over a large enough region of time most of the time you'll have some voiced a fair amount of voiced uh energy in it.|S
me011|right.|B
me013|and so i think that would be|D
me011|and he has on his graph something like forty per cent.|S
me011|it looked like fifty per cent or more are point two seconds or longer overlap.|S
me011|it's i think the last page.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
me013|is it?|Q
fe008|that'll also lessen the standard deviation.|S
mn005|here in the yeah it it's a new new a new diapositive with information about the context for overlapping zone.|S
me011|nope not the last page.|S
mn005|um|F
me011|where was it?|Q
me011|it was one of the tables.|S
me013|what|D
mn005|how define?|Q
me013|are you using a pitch detector in this yet in your experiments?|Q
mn005|uh|D
me013|do you have a pitch detector that you're using?|Q
mn005|my|D
me013|do you do you have a a pitch detector that you are using in these experiments?|Q
fe008|pitch?|Q
mn005|uh i i'm working now with pitch detector.|S
fe016|well it's the fifth page i guess.|S
me013|yeah.|S
mn005|i'm working now but uh i haven't uh results yet.|S
me011|fifth page.|S
mn005|but uh at this moment i i i prepare i am i am preparing the the pitch uh uh tracking pitch tracker uh algorithm that i have.|S
me011|oh it's seventy five per cent!|S
me013|does does it have a voiced unvoiced uh detector in it?|Q
mn005|but uh|D
me013|uh|F
mn005|no.|S
me013|it doesn't.|S
me013|it just finds the it just finds the pitch even when it's unvoiced?|Q
me013|i mean it must have some it has to tell you something.|S
mn005|uh i i|D
fe016|it has to tell you.|S
fe016|it has to give you at least a zero one.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
me013|right?|Q
fe016|i mean uh binary|D
me013|yeah.|B
mn005|it's based on uh a correlation between frame the utterance.|S
me013|yeah.|B
mn005|but uh i don't know what is um uh|D
me013|right.|B
mn005|because it's no my my algorithm.|S
me013|yeah so ordinarily in these things it does tell you that it's it's voiced with a pitch of such and such.|S
mn005|is|D
me013|and it will it will say something like zero.|S
mn005|uhhuh.|S
me013|or you know it'll have something that it says when it's when it can't find a good good uh uh period.|S
mn005|uhhuh.|S
me013|right?|Q
me013|so it's looking for some periodic behavior.|S
me013|and if it can't find a period it tells you for for most things like that.|S
mn005|uhhuh.|B
mn005|for most.|D
me013|so i mean this is getting back to what liz was suggesting.|S
me013|which i think actually is good the more i think of it.|S
me013|that that um for normalization you could do something like take voiced sections and normalize to equalize the energy in that.|S
me013|i'm just still going back to normalization that even though it's roughly normalized uh for overall gain i think it it's it it may not be normalized enough.|S
mn005|uhhuh.|B
mn005|for for both for uh the frame energy and uh residular l p c uh energy too?|Q
me013|uh for both.|S
me013|yeah.|B
mn005|for both.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me013|yeah.|B
mn005|but uh i test different normalization.|S
mn005|i uh|D
mn005|what kind of normalization?|Q
mn005|i i|D
me013|okay so so i think i mean this is something to to experimentally determine.|S
mn005|this is|D
mn005|yeah.|S
me013|but i mean if um|D
mn005|yeah.|B
me013|as i understand it you have you have some regions that uh um are marked as|D
me013|you have training data that you're trying to find a threshold.|S
me013|right?|Q
me013|and so um um if you take um all the things all the uh speak things marked s p k and uh look for the voiced uh energy in them|D
mn005|uhhuh.|B
mn005|uhhuh.|B
me013|and uh|F
me013|well just in in each case take a take a take a frame.|S
me013|take the|D
me013|uh uh|F
me013|if it's if it's voiced include it.|S
me013|just separate out from the from the normal things.|S
fe016|uhhuh uhhuh.|B
me013|separate out voiced.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
me013|right.|S
me013|then you're going to end up with uh a a uh a mean uh standard deviation and so forth.|S
me013|and then do your normalization based on that.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
me013|and once you do that just for voiced|D
me013|um um|F
me013|i guess you'd|D
fe016|you can also look at just the voiced regions later.|S
fe016|i mean that would be the most sensitive measure.|S
fe016|because you know if you're normalizing for voiced and then you look at regions that are voiced with the same robustness in estimation of what voicing is um you should be much more sensitive to the to the overlaps then if you|D
mn005|yeah.|B
fe016|you know if you normalize but you look everywhere at at at fricatives or something you won't really know anything.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe016|so i mean assuming if it's true that the overlap regions are sort of long enough that there's some voicing in each of them by each of the speakers then you should do very well if you do this.|S
me013|right.|B
me013|right.|B
me013|right.|S
fe016|but you'll only know that in the voiced regions.|S
mn005|huh.|B
fe016|but those are close enough to the|D
fe016|you know there's enough voicing going on and off uh that if you can capture the voicing and if you can capture it when there's overlap then you should do quite well there.|S
mn005|uhhuh.|B
mn005|huh.|B
fe008|i'm wondering about um if there|D
fe008|i suppose this is still just that one that one data sample.|S
fe008|right?|Q
fe008|that one meeting?|Q
mn005|yeah.|B
fe008|but it seems like to have it it seems like a very hard test to have it be looking at the energy of all the speakers combined rather than taking you know maybe two extreme speakers out of the mix and seeing if if it's promising with respect to that type of analysis.|S
fe008|if you take like a target speaker and maybe|D
me013|yeah.|S
fe008|well i mean if there's enough data maybe two.|S
fe008|two target speakers.|S
fe008|and then compare that to the mixture of all the speakers.|S
me013|you could do that.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me013|i mean be and if they still overlapped i i the|D
fe008|that's hard.|D
me013|but but i i think that this is a good first thing to just sort of see.|S
me013|and and what this says is that that without any special normalization at least this is there's a lot of overlap here.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
fe008|okay.|B
me013|and so i mean coming back to jose's question|D
me013|i mean there's still this issue of of of how much time|D
me013|i mean|D
me013|what do you look at in order to normalize?|Q
me013|i mean you you get some data in you don't know which it is how do you how do you what period of time do you look over to normalize it by?|Q
mn005|yeah.|S
me013|and and uh that's that's something to think about and experiment with.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
fe016|i think also the harmonics would be very important.|S
fe016|so if you can find voiced regions and|D
me013|yes.|S
fe016|you know if you have two speakers and they're both voicing|D
fe016|unless they have very similar you know pitch you should be able to see the difference in harmonics pretty clearly.|S
me013|right so that's what we were talking about before with with harmonicity measure.|S
fe016|just by counting them.|S
me011|um and the length|D
fe016|i mean|D
mn005|yeah.|B
fe016|yeah so even if you're not exactly sure when the overlap starts and ends because there's some non voiced regions at least you can have these islands of reliability where you're pretty sure.|S
me013|yeah so|F
mn005|yeah.|B
me011|it seems like with the overlaps being fairly long that should make it easier.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
fe016|right.|S
me011|that that was an interesting statistic.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
fe016|and you could put an estimate estimate you know a fuzzy start and end time.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
me011|that they're much longer than i expected.|S
mn005|but this is very short.|S
me011|ninety per cent of them are over two two hundred milliseconds.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
mn005|yeah.|B
me013|yeah.|B
mn005|is a problem to detect.|S
fe016|well it's sort of good though if you're for for your accuracy.|S
mn005|but it's a problem to it's a problem to identify and to detect too with uh the javier system for example.|S
me011|it is good.|S
me011|but it's uh but it surprised me.|S
fe016|uh gives you a little more time to try to detect them.|S
me011|yes.|S
me011|for example.|S
mn005|for example.|S
mn005|it's a problem.|S
me013|yeah.|S
me013|uh well|D
mn005|uh|F
mn005|uh what|D
me013|good.|S
mn005|sorry.|S
me013|yeah.|S
mn005|what what happened with the different contexts?|Q
mn005|because uh uh you are talking about uh the period or the the duration of the the window to uh the the long of the window to to consider normalization.|S
mn005|no?|Q
me013|yeah and i i|D
mn005|but uh we have different contexts.|S
mn005|the the the the period the the the length of the window to to normalize uh the energy is uh in the context of the overlapping zone?|Q
mn005|is uh in the in the left context as in in the right context considering uh the these frames?|Q
mn005|you mean?|Q
me013|i don't know.|S
me013|i i want to think about it.|S
me013|and you should think about it.|S
mn005|yeah.|S
me013|i i i didn't want to just pop out an answer.|S
me013|because i realized i i hadn't thought about it enough.|S
mn005|okay.|S
me011|two hundred milliseconds hamming window.|S
mn005|because because the the the problem is that we have different contexts.|S
fe016|yeah something|D
mn005|different situation and|D
fe016|something like that.|S
fe008|that's true.|S
fe008|that's complicated.|S
fe016|too.|S
me018|just out of curiosity what was the bug?|Q
me013|i'm not sure.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
me018|what was the bug that you found?|Q
mn005|what the|D
me018|the bug from last uh meeting.|S
mn005|uh the bug.|S
mn005|the bug of was the the f seek function in c.|S
mn005|because doesn't work uh when you uh you try to to to to do an a dated access to to a file a big file uh uh moving the the head of the in the hard disk uh forward and backward a lot of time|D
me018|uhhuh.|B
me018|uhhuh.|B
mn005|uh in a moment f seek function doesn't work.|S
me011|huh.|B
mn005|and i had an problem.|S
fe008|uh that's interesting.|S
fe008|and it didn't give you good error messages.|S
mn005|yes this is this is it's incredible.|S
fe008|huh.|B
me018|huh!|B
mn005|i i i do the same in in another in another way.|S
me018|so it was positioning randomly?|Q
mn005|and i haven't problem.|S
me011|did you typecast to long?|Q
me011|or size t or whatever it is?|Q
me011|i don't remember what it is.|S
me011|one of the problems if the file is large um and you're cast to the wrong type.|S
mn005|i i i don't know.|S
mn005|but uh i i think the the position in the file uh doesn't work uh uh in long file.|S
mn005|a very long file.|S
me013|well what he's saying is that the typecasting could be the issue for f seek.|S
me011|right if you're sending at an integer instead of a long.|S
mn005|the typecast?|Q
me011|typecast from integer int i n t or long or unsigned long.|S
mn005|yeah.|B
mn005|uh it's um no no it's unsigned.|S
me011|i think it's|D
me011|yeah.|B
me011|well it's one possibility.|S
mn005|signed.|S
me013|yeah because i think in i mean in general f seek works.|S
mn005|i i i don't know.|S
me013|so it's|D
me011|yep.|S
mn005|i don't know.|S
mn005|but uh i i solved the problem with uh a similar way and i haven't problem.|S
me013|yeah yeah.|B
me011|uhhuh.|B
me013|yeah.|B
mn005|but uh i i i don't know because uh uh it doesn't uh happen to me before.|S
me013|yeah.|B
mn005|but uh i i i have the same codes in different parts.|S
me013|anyway|F
mn005|and uh i i had to to to change all all the points in the in the code uh to substitute uh for another way.|S
me011|yep.|B
mn005|but uh is|D
me013|anyway we're we're missing snacks here.|S
me013|so uh let's let's let's let's do our let's do our digits.|S
mn005|oh okay.|S
me011|shall we do digits?|Q
mn005|sorry.|S
fe008|oh digits.|S
me013|and and uh|F
fe008|okay.|S
me011|okay.|S
me011|are we done?|Q
me011|yes okay.|S
me013|yep.|B
mn005|okay.|B
me011|okay we are going off.|S
