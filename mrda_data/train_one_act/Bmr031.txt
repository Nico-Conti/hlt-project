fe008|well i tend to|D
fe008|there're a couple meetings where there are a lot of preambles like this.|S
fe008|in which case the transcription doesn't start until someone actually says okay.|S
me013|really?|Q
fe008|so we're starting right now.|S
fe016|well that's good.|S
me013|yeah oh yeah the meeting's started.|S
me013|this is this is the real thing.|S
fe008|this is the|D
me013|this is the real thing.|S
me013|oh well never mind!|S
me013|it wasn't.|S
me013|there goes chuck.|S
me013|just kidding.|S
me013|it was.|S
me013|okay.|S
me013|so|F
me011|and chuck gets stuck with the ear plug mike.|S
me013|okay last guy in gets the|D
fe008|yeah.|B
fe008|didn't get the door.|S
me013|oh you just get the door now.|S
me011|but he didn't shut the door.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me011|i got it.|S
me011|since|D
me013|yeah so i i adam sent around this thing about what we were going to talk about.|S
me013|and and we had had this discussion of uh flipping back and forth between an emphasis on on the technology particularly recognition versus uh the recordings and transcriptions and so on.|S
me013|um but um|F
me013|i was asking if we could to uh kind of make it just whatever is happening rather than one or the other.|S
me013|because uh next weekend next week i'll be at a meeting on campus.|S
mn017|sure.|S
me013|and after that i'll be europe for uh several meetings' worth.|S
me013|uh you folks will be gone for a couple of the meetings' worth in in europe also.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
fe016|i overlap exactly with the times you're gone.|S
me013|right?|Q
me013|really?|Q
fe016|i mean|D
me013|okay yeah.|S
fe016|yeah.|B
me013|so|F
me013|so uh you didn't you didn't get an agenda.|S
me013|i guess we've got the usual|D
me011|well because no one no one ever responded with any items.|S
me013|yeah.|S
me011|so i have a couple of minor ones.|S
me011|uh|F
me011|our normal transcription status.|S
me011|just so that we can make some some plans.|S
me011|so what's up with i b m chuck?|Q
me011|do you know?|Q
me018|um i think brian is on vacation now.|S
me018|but uh before he left we gave him uh another set of meetings to give to the transcribers.|S
me018|and|D
me001|how many?|Q
me018|uh what is it?|Q
me011|is is yours working there chuck?|Q
me018|four.|S
mn014|four.|S
me001|oh.|S
me018|four.|D
me011|can you|D
me011|you're you're b?|Q
me018|test.|S
me018|what am i?|Q
fe008|is it turned on?|Q
me011|there's no on.|S
me018|test.|S
fe008|okay.|S
me018|yeah.|S
me011|oh it's just|D
fe008|channel b.|S
me011|i'll let me raise the gain on that a little bit.|S
me018|okay.|B
fe008|channel b.|S
me011|since it's so far from your mouth.|S
me011|sorry.|S
me013|okay so we sent them|D
me018|so we gave them four meetings before he left.|S
me018|and um|F
me018|that's it.|S
me018|so um i don't think we'll hear from him before he gets back.|S
me011|okay.|S
me013|and|D
fe008|do they know about your pie chart?|Q
me018|i don't know.|S
fe008|okay.|S
me018|i don't know.|S
me013|what pie chart?|Q
me011|pie?|Q
me011|oh.|S
fe008|he has a nice pie chart on the uh the current status page.|S
fe016|pie.|S
fe008|which shows the amount of amount of data that had been transcribed.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and the amount out of the entire|D
fe008|and at this point it's not quite half.|S
fe008|wouldn't is that what you'd say with the pie chart?|Q
me018|yeah.|S
fe008|and then of that there's uh a little sliver.|S
fe008|i could try and draw it.|S
fe008|but it's probably better to describe.|S
me013|half the data that's been recorded has been transcribed?|Q
fe008|roughly almost.|S
fe008|not quite.|S
me013|wow that's getting pretty good.|S
fe008|and i haven't actually caught up with uh|D
fe008|since i got back so recently from my vacation.|S
fe008|um i know that the transcribers finished um uh several meetings while i was gone.|S
me018|oh.|S
fe008|and i haven't told you.|S
fe008|because i haven't i haven't figured out which ones they are are yet.|S
me018|right.|S
fe008|but when that happens then that pie will get even closer to the mid line.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
me018|uhhuh.|B
fe008|it's not quite not quite fifty percent.|S
fe008|but really getting close.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe008|i think it will be.|S
me011|okay so also um|D
mn017|you mean pi will be close to one half?|Q
fe008|well not mathematically.|S
mn017|that's new.|S
me011|now that's a strange|D
me013|well if we can have three point one four times as much transcribed as we recorded we really would be doing well.|S
me011|yep.|B
mn017|right.|B
fe008|but it's a nice it's i recommend his his his graphic.|S
me011|um so|F
mn017|you know this this raises some|D
fe008|because it's it's a really nice graphic.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me011|how much|D
mn017|how do you transcribe that?|Q
me011|how much do we need transcribed before it's worth doing some trainings?|Q
mn017|oh uh|F
fe016|huh|F
me011|i mean it seems like probably we have enough now.|S
mn017|we can|D
me011|right?|Q
me011|because like like macrophone wasn't that much data.|S
fe016|you mean|D
me011|right?|Q
me011|and it helped.|S
mn017|well we already use it for digit training.|S
fe016|but but that was read speech.|S
me011|you only used that for digits.|S
mn017|i mean|D
me011|right.|S
mn017|well we did do some training on digits|D
me011|that's right.|S
mn017|uh rather adaptation on digits digits.|S
mn017|i mean supervised adaptation.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
mn017|so|F
mn017|yeah i mean uh|D
fe016|maybe like twenty hours we could try.|S
fe016|but maybe not counting the non native speech.|S
fe016|because if that that just doesn't translate very well.|S
mn017|well|D
mn017|i would i would love to do some um|D
mn017|you know with adaptation you can use fairly small amount of data to improve your performance.|S
me011|right.|S
mn017|um and|F
mn017|you know it's just basically.|S
mn017|uh uh|F
mn017|you know i i don't have to time to to do too much these days.|S
mn017|except what i'm already doing.|S
mn017|so|F
me011|uhhuh.|B
mn017|um but if there's some someone has some free time i'm i'll be happy to show them how it works.|S
mn017|and you can play with it.|S
me011|cool.|S
me011|um|F
me013|uh i thought you you were already using adaptation on the test set.|S
mn017|no supervised adaptation.|S
me011|supervised.|S
mn017|so we're doing unsupervised speaker adaptation.|S
me013|i see.|S
mn017|but you could build a test set which you sort of take your models and do supervised adaptation.|S
me013|oh okay.|S
me013|got it.|S
mn017|and then you start with the speaker adaptation from sort of channel adapted.|S
me013|right.|S
me013|right.|B
mn017|or room adapted.|S
mn017|or whatever.|S
me013|yeah yeah yeah whatever this is.|S
me011|how would you imagine doing a test set on this corpus?|Q
me011|a test set training set division.|S
me011|i mean it's really weird.|S
me011|right?|Q
me011|because it's it would be hard to get speaker disjoint sets.|S
mn017|right.|S
me011|do do we just give up on that?|Q
fe016|right and actually the i was thinking about this.|S
fe016|the original application doesn't really|D
fe016|i mean if you're using this over and over again you're going to be testing on the same the same speakers.|S
me011|well but then you have the supervised versus unsupervised question.|S
fe016|i just mean that it's not a terrible thing to assume that you don't that you don't have disjoint sets.|S
me011|right.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
me011|so|F
fe016|for this particular kind of application.|S
fe016|i mean|D
me011|yeah.|B
me013|yeah.|B
me013|i mean you could have some parts of it that are disjoint and some that aren't.|S
mn017|it's it's sort of like in um broadcast news.|S
me013|and see what the difference is you know on the others.|S
fe016|yeah.|B
me013|yeah.|B
mn017|because you have those people who re occur over and over.|S
me013|yeah.|B
mn017|i mean the anchor speakers tend typically|D
me011|right.|B
mn017|so|F
mn017|um|F
mn017|yeah as long as you're aware that you're doing that that's i don't see that as a problem.|S
me013|you can separate it out and see how if they're|D
me011|and then similarly with subject matter.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me011|that you know if you're training your language model on this meeting only and testing on this meeting only you're going to do a lot better than if you start crossing them.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
fe016|somewhat although what's interesting is that the majority of the words in the language model are actually|D
me013|uhhuh.|B
me011|are the same.|S
fe016|yeah they're actually these like function words.|S
me011|sure.|S
fe016|and yeah and stuff like that.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe016|and there there's a lot of speaker dependence there.|S
fe016|even the transcribers will say they know who the speaker is after a while just from their backchannels.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me011|just from word choice.|S
fe016|and|D
fe016|right.|S
fe016|so so i don't think you're talking the way you write in in other words.|S
me011|most certainly so it's just uh if we're going to do that we should give some thought to how we want to divide it up.|S
me013|yeah yeah so you know maybe someone else would do a lot of the work where probably your advice.|S
me011|yeah and similarly with digits we now have a lot of digits.|S
mn017|yeah.|B
me013|would be helpful.|S
me011|but most of them aren't transcribed.|S
me011|so if we wanted to do a forced alignment on them we could start collecting ourselves up a fairly large digit corpus.|S
me013|yeah well we'd|D
me011|and so same issue.|S
me011|you know we just need to get someone who's interested in that to start looking at it.|S
me013|we want that for sure.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me011|so who's working on digits currently?|Q
me013|uh dave gelbart.|S
me011|okay maybe i'll talk to him and see if he's interested.|S
me013|not right away.|S
me011|yeah certainly.|S
me013|he's got prelims.|S
me011|he wants to pass the prelims.|S
me013|and|F
me013|yeah.|B
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|um one thing uh uh just a uh uh an announcement of sorts is that um chuck is going to be going to a meeting at nist.|S
me013|in uh about a month and a half i guess.|S
me013|they're still working out the date.|S
me013|because they want to gather together sort of one person from each site who is involved in the meeting stuff.|S
me013|since they're going to be doing a bunch of meeting recordings there.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
me013|and so uh|F
me011|is uh are the c m u folks going to be there?|Q
me013|somebody you know it's like one person|D
me013|at the moment it's one person from each site.|S
me013|so there'll be somebody from the c m u and somebody from here and somebody from uh a a number of places.|S
me013|probably somebody from u w.|S
me013|um so|F
me013|yeah it's possible they'll open it up to more people.|S
me013|but but i think you know the main thing is just to|D
me013|uh uh uh uh it's not a it's not a conference.|S
me013|it's not a workshop really.|S
me011|right.|B
me013|it's just connecting with them.|S
me013|so|F
me013|um so then if they start a bunch of recordings then ultimately they'll they'll have training sets and test sets.|S
me013|and and all that all that stuff.|S
me013|and|F
me013|but|D
mn017|but it would be interesting to hear what they intend to do about the speaker overlap for instance.|S
me011|right.|S
me013|yeah.|S
fe016|what's the plan if were we still going to be like a center for transcribing data?|Q
fe016|what happens if they don't deliver things until next year or something when we have less resources?|Q
fe016|or|D
me013|well again the hope is that uh i mean it's it's looking i mean i have to ask these folks.|S
me013|but uh my impression is that the um i b m path is looking you know more promising.|S
me011|yep.|B
me011|it it pretty good.|S
me011|yeah.|B
me013|and if that's the case and if it turns out that uh it's really a relatively small amount of time.|S
me013|for our transcribers to process things before and after.|S
me013|if they really have taken out enough of the of the uh uh work that that it's feasible then maybe we can do it with a smaller staff next year.|S
fe016|uhhuh.|B
fe016|uhhuh.|B
me013|i mean next next year uh in which he's you're referring to is uh next year we we don't have a whole lot of guaranteed funding for this this work.|S
me013|um other funding may come.|S
me013|you know that's but but if we want to just count on uh uh what we know about it's it's more modest than this year.|S
me013|uh it's still there'll still be money.|S
me013|but it's just more modest.|S
me013|so|F
me013|um so i would see us as probably not doing more recordings.|S
me013|at least for for for meetings or or digits or anything.|S
me013|but uh if if we feel that we need to probably still doing some recordings for smartkom or something.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me013|um but otherwise just you know stop that.|S
me013|and just take whatever comes from the other places.|S
me013|which|D
me013|uh|F
me013|i guess we have an unknown rate.|S
me013|if it if it starts being if they're generating this huge amount and we can't handle it then you know we'll tell them.|S
me013|but|F
me013|uh although it would have been nice if that their stuff had come earlier.|S
me013|it's in some ways a good thing.|S
me013|because we've been ironing out this path.|S
me013|so|F
me011|um well i got a email from one of the u w guys.|S
me011|they want to record the meetings at higher uh sampling rate than sixteen kilohertz.|S
me011|uh|F
me011|i didn't ask why.|S
me011|but it seems to me that really doesn't matter.|S
me011|if they have the disk space to do it it seems that that is not a big deal.|S
me011|i was just wondering if anyone had an opinion about mismatched rates.|S
me013|well it's just if that they're sending it to us then we have to have the disk space to do it too.|S
fe008|can't we downsample?|Q
fe008|and uh transcribe on that basis.|S
me013|that would be the hope.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me011|yep.|B
me013|are they doing some nice integer multiple?|Q
me013|or|D
me011|excuse me?|Q
me013|are they doing some nice integer multiple of of sixteen?|Q
me011|no.|S
fe016|are they they're doing like twenty two?|Q
me011|no no no it was like forty something.|S
fe016|or|D
fe016|could|D
fe016|forty eight.|S
fe016|forty forty four.|S
me011|forty four.|S
me011|forty two.|S
me001|so c d.|S
fe016|yeah.|B
fe016|c d rom.|S
mn014|c d.|S
me011|yeah.|B
fe016|yeah.|B
me013|oh forty four point one.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
fe016|forty four.|S
me001|forty four one.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me013|yeah.|B
me011|something like that.|S
me013|oh so that's|D
me013|well you know we record here at at forty eight or something.|S
me011|and then we downsample yep.|S
me013|and then we downsample.|S
me001|but forty eight's a nice multiple of eight.|S
fe016|but but it but forty four and sixteen are not easy.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me013|well you can do it.|S
me001|you can do it i think.|S
fe016|yeah?|Q
me013|oh absolutely you can do it.|S
fe016|it's not lossy?|Q
me013|yeah you can do you can go from anything to anything else.|S
me001|you|D
me013|but but it's it's just it's it's just a little more complicated.|S
me011|you get aliasing.|S
fe016|as long as you're|D
fe016|yeah.|B
fe016|as long as you're not doing the processing on the downsampled.|S
me001|there's probably some|D
fe016|i mean just for transcribing it you mean.|S
me013|it's just like|D
me013|yeah.|S
me013|so|D
me013|yeah i mean it's just slightly more complicated.|S
me013|but it's but you can you can go from any frequency to any other frequency.|S
me013|so it's|D
me011|well the the only thought was if we're going to do a combined corpus does it really matter if some's sampled at one rate and some's sampled at the other?|Q
me011|my feeling is no it doesn't.|S
me011|your audio these days audio tools tend to take care of all of that.|S
me011|but i just wanted to double check with other people before i told them yeah no problem.|S
fe008|also seems like the corpus could all be standardized on on this the uh|D
me011|that's what i was saying.|S
me018|why are why are they asking us?|Q
me011|so so|D
fe008|yeah.|B
me011|i don't know.|S
me011|why are they asking us?|Q
me011|because you know we're sort of doing the corpus.|S
me011|so they want to be as similar as possible.|S
me013|and so i|D
me011|so but i think the answer is if if we tell him no that's not all right what he'll probably say is well we're going to do it anyway.|S
mn017|it could be interesting.|S
me018|well that's that's why i'm asking.|S
me011|but uh|D
mn017|well it will be interesting to find out why they are choosing a higher sampling.|S
me001|yeah.|S
me011|uh|D
me011|yep.|S
me001|it's kind of a|D
me013|well i would suspect it's because it's what the hardware does.|S
fe016|for|D
me011|oh and they just don't want to downsample.|S
fe016|yeah.|S
me013|yeah.|S
me001|well someone's going to have to downsample.|S
mn017|but then they're just they're just there's just deferring the problem to later.|S
me001|yeah.|B
mn017|and they might save themselves a lot of disk space problems by doing it right away.|S
fe016|they're taking up more disk space.|S
me001|yeah it|D
mn014|yeah.|B
me013|i i think it's the sort of thing that's deserving of discussion with them.|S
me011|okay.|S
me013|i i don't think it's like uh they'll ask us we'll give a simple answer.|S
me013|and come back.|S
me013|it needs some back and forth.|S
mn017|i mean that's|D
me013|because it's it's a little gnarly to have parts of the database with different things.|S
mn017|that's like three times three times as much disk space.|S
fe016|yeah.|B
me001|yeah it's four or five times.|S
me013|and it's|D
mn014|yeah.|B
me001|depends what you save.|S
me013|um|F
me013|you know part of the arguments for the higher sampling rate is that maybe there's something you know say in six to ten kilohertz that you might use for for some purposes somewhere.|S
me013|if people are doing a wide range of things|D
me013|doing location.|S
me013|uh you know doing a bunch of things.|S
me013|maybe you know why why throw it away if you don't need to?|Q
me013|um on the other hand|D
me013|um i mean|D
me013|it's sixty kilohertz is plenty.|S
me011|yep that's that's what i thought.|S
me001|yeah.|B
me013|so so|F
me013|so uh i i i think it's it's uh|D
me013|and they are going to be using up a lot of disk.|S
me013|both for them and for us when we're processing their stuff.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
mn017|we should warn them that these disk space issues are going to creep up on them very fast.|S
me013|uh if they|D
me011|yep yep.|B
fe016|they'll have to start kicking people out of the meetings.|S
me013|well if if they're going at forty four they won't even creep.|S
me011|yeah but|D
fe016|like|D
me001|yeah.|S
mn014|yeah.|S
fe016|as long as they have only like three people per meeting.|S
me013|they'll just pounce.|S
me018|how many channels?|Q
fe016|i mean they can just limit the number of people.|S
me011|um i don't remember what their hardware set up was.|S
me011|but it was smaller than ours.|S
me013|well that might help a bit.|S
me011|yeah.|S
me013|yeah actually i think at nist they were there were there was some discussion of fairly high sampling rates too.|S
me011|well with nist i think|D
me013|so|F
me011|they're they're in a different situation because they're doing video.|S
me011|and so compared to the video the audio is just noise.|S
me011|in terms of disk space.|S
me001|uhhuh.|B
me011|literally.|S
me013|i don't think that's true.|S
me011|really?|Q
me013|they're recording fifty channels of mikes.|S
me011|they're not recording all fifty of the array.|S
me011|they're they're cooking it down.|S
me013|yeah they are.|S
fe016|yeah they were they said they were going to record|D
me011|aren't they?|Q
me013|they're recording all of them.|S
fe016|i don't know if there were fifty.|S
fe016|but there were definitely above like twenty.|S
me011|whew.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me011|that's funny.|S
me011|i thought that they were cooking down that data in some way before they were storing it.|S
fe016|it was it was high.|S
me013|i don't believe so.|S
me013|no i don't think so.|S
me013|no so i think they they have actually a very large audio data rate.|S
me013|i think it is comparable to a video data rate.|S
me001|okay.|S
me013|so|F
me018|how in the world are they going to ever distribute this?|Q
me011|yeah distributing|D
me011|they're not going to.|S
me013|uh|F
me018|you're going to have to just get|D
me013|interesting question.|S
me018|because our|D
me011|you'll have to just work on little subsets of it.|S
me011|there's just no way you could get it all.|S
me018|we're we're estimating that ours|D
me018|if we collect say a hundred meetings|D
me018|and each meeting is just the audio.|S
me018|compressed audio's half a gig.|S
me018|so there's fifty gigs just for our corpus.|S
me011|yep.|S
me018|for a hundred meetings.|S
me018|and uh you know|D
me001|that's eight kilohertz?|Q
me013|and that's and that's and that's no video.|S
me011|sixteen.|S
mn014|sixteen.|S
me018|that's sixteen.|S
fe016|sixteen.|S
me001|sixteen.|S
me018|and so|D
me013|sample rate.|S
fe016|you just get like one backchannel at a time or something.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me001|oh it's shortened.|S
me018|even even a distribution of fifty gigs.|S
me001|oh okay.|S
mn014|yeah it's shortened.|S
me001|and then shortened.|S
me018|you know it's if you use d v ds or something that's|D
mn014|yeah.|B
me011|a lot.|S
me018|it's still yeah two or three d v ds.|S
me018|but|D
me013|yeah not if you have to distribute the video also.|S
me011|two or three?|Q
me018|if you use both sides and the two layer and all that.|S
me011|it's a lot more than that.|S
me011|right?|Q
me011|d v d is eight gig.|S
me013|well i think you'll have some interesting discussions next month when you go out there.|S
me018|seventeen.|S
me018|yeah yeah.|B
me013|i mean how are they going to you know what's what's the distribution plan?|Q
me018|uhhuh.|B
me013|if they have something really smart in mind you know maybe we can use it.|S
me013|i mean i mean we talked about sending around a disk or a computer.|S
me011|i think that's definitely the right way to do it.|S
me011|someone sends us disk.|S
me011|we we load it with data and send it back.|S
me011|it's going to be easier than any other method.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|maybe a maybe|D
me011|well if not if you want to burn the c ds you're welcome to it.|S
me018|i say we give it to l d c and let them do it.|S
me011|well yeah.|S
fe016|uhhuh.|B
me011|yeah absolutely if they have a way of doing it.|S
fe016|and there's never any talk|D
me011|i'm thinking prior to that.|S
me001|what's l d c?|Q
fe016|was there ever any talk of taking the um close talking mikes when people aren't talking and deleting those portions?|Q
mn017|linguistic data consortium.|S
me001|huh.|S
fe016|or is the breathing and things|D
me011|we already do that.|S
me011|shorten does that automatically.|S
fe016|yeah?|Q
fe016|okay.|S
me011|that's why you why that's why shorten that's why shorten reduces the size so much.|S
fe016|and if they're still that big?|Q
fe016|i see yeah that's true.|S
me013|that's why it's only fifty gigs.|S
me011|right.|S
fe016|okay so it's still really big even if you're only one person or two people at most are actually talking all the time.|S
me011|yep.|S
fe016|wow!|S
mn017|we should just talk less.|S
fe016|have shorter meetings!|S
me011|well if you talk less it does in fact use less data.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me011|so the channels|D
mn014|yeah.|B
me013|hey it's it's the first time i've ever heard you ask for less data.|S
me011|huh|D
me011|it's actually one way to tell if a microphone is dead in a meeting is if the shortened file is too short.|S
fe016|thanks morgan.|S
mn014|it's really short yeah yeah.|S
me011|then you can be pretty sure that the mike was off.|S
fe008|oh.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
mn017|uh okay.|S
me011|and the unfortunately the table top ones|D
me011|the six table top which we record all the time no matter how many people are there uh don't compress nearly as well.|S
me011|because they're almost always have signal on them.|S
me013|yeah that's probably a lot of it.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
mn014|yeah.|B
me013|and they're going to have mikes like that too.|S
me001|yeah.|B
me011|yep.|S
me013|in fact their array their array will be|D
me011|most of them.|S
me001|all of them are like that.|S
me011|yep so they won't shorten nearly as well.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe016|wow!|S
me011|and i assume they're going to do it lossless.|S
fe016|yeah so so they're really going to have a huge|D
mn017|so so for|D
mn017|for distribution purposes it might make sense to split it by channel uh rather than by meetings.|S
me011|yeah.|S
mn017|so you could distribute like only the near field signals uh uh uh together for a bunch of meetings.|S
me011|yep absolutely.|S
mn017|and then have a second row.|S
me011|and then maybe one far field.|S
me011|you know.|S
me011|it's things or the mixed channel.|S
mn017|yeah.|B
me011|yeah i think there are a lot of ways to do it.|S
me011|but let's not worry about that now.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|yeah.|B
mn017|right.|S
me013|yeah.|S
me011|how are we on disk space chuck?|Q
me018|um we're okay.|S
me018|we've got for the uh compressed meetings we've still got about|D
me018|i think it was four gigs uh on the one disk that we're using.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
me018|and we've got several|D
me018|we've still got uh quite a bit of space on the uh un backed up.|S
me018|so|F
me011|good.|S
me018|but i i think it's probably we should start thinking about where to go next.|S
me018|especially on the backed up disk space.|S
me013|now we bought a little not all that long ago we brought three uh thirty six gigabyte disks.|S
me018|that's the un backed up.|S
me018|yeah those are the|D
me011|yeah we're using those for the for the expanded.|S
me018|so for example the uh guenter's wall street data went onto one of those.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
me018|uh some other experiment things that people are doing are on there.|S
me018|and|F
me018|so if you put it there people will use it.|S
me018|yeah so|F
me013|so i think after that we need another uh rack or something.|S
me018|have to change servers actually.|S
me013|right?|Q
me013|change servers?|Q
me018|well we could we could there are a bunch of disks that we have uh that are smaller.|S
me018|and they're like seventeen.|S
me018|we could go to thirty five.|S
me018|so we could get some extra space out of that.|S
me018|but the right now the server's full.|S
me018|we couldn't add any more disks.|S
me018|we could change a smaller disk for a larger one.|S
me013|we should probably do that while we have the space left on the on the the existing thirty sixes.|S
me018|yeah.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me013|so that we can|D
me018|yeah.|B
me011|yeah the problem with that for backed up media is uh the sysadmins want to keep them at eighteen meg eighteen gig partitions.|S
me013|shuffle it around.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me011|because that takes about a day to get off back up tape.|S
me013|oh.|S
me018|well then there's the other issue is that to to add more disk now um david says we really need to go to new servers.|S
me011|so|F
me018|but he wants to go to new servers not just for us.|S
me018|but for other groups too.|S
me011|for the whole institute.|S
me011|yeah.|B
me018|so there's this sort of coordination issue.|S
me018|and|F
me018|i guess i need to talk to him more about|D
me011|actually going to bigger disks we can do even|D
me011|and just maintain the eighteen gig partitions.|S
me011|you just partition them into multiple.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me018|yeah.|B
me011|so that's probably the next step.|S
me013|that's right.|S
me011|is to get the eighty or ninety gig drives to replace the thirty gig or an eighteen gig that we have now.|S
me013|there are eighty gig drives now that you can get for that?|Q
me011|yeah yeah.|S
me013|see and that's probably what we should send around for these to for distribution of this corpus.|S
me013|this isn't any|D
me011|a whole handful of microdrives.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me018|well when they come out with|D
me011|is is the areal density of the microdrive higher than of a normal drive?|Q
me011|it must be.|S
me018|when they come out with the eighty gig microdrive then we'll just send one of those little things around with all the meeting data.|S
me011|yep.|S
mn014|yeah.|S
me013|yeah that's what i meant.|S
me011|well they have the two gig already.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me011|and i'm i'm just thinking forty of them is probably still smaller in area than uh one normal sized drive.|S
me013|actually what i think what what uh|D
me013|was it was it dave who was suggesting that uh you just get uh uh a a computer?|Q
me011|yep.|B
me013|that has one of these drives in it.|S
me013|and just send the computer around to the different sites.|S
me001|oh god|D
me013|and you can just get it off the computer.|S
me001|put the computer on tour.|S
me013|and press the|D
me011|yeah a laptop.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me013|laptop yeah.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me013|send the laptop.|S
me011|eighty gig laptop.|S
me013|and of course you don't want we don't want to trust the shippers necessarily.|S
me013|so you send a person too.|S
me013|and they just kind of go from site to site.|S
me011|i'll i'll do that.|S
me013|and|D
me013|download their data kind of johnny appleseed.|S
me011|it uh uh unfortunately it takes me a week at each site.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me013|what?|Q
me011|it does take a week at each site.|S
me011|so|F
me013|does it?|Q
me011|yeah absolutely if it's a nice site.|S
fe016|especially hawaii.|S
me013|yeah there's a there's a they really need it in novosibirsk.|S
me011|yeah right.|S
me011|that only takes a day or so.|S
me011|anyway.|F
me013|i'm probably mispronouncing it well.|S
mn017|but the university of hawaii has issued a request.|S
me011|yep.|S
me013|yeah uhhuh that that needs a month.|S
me013|yeah.|B
mn017|yeah.|B
me013|to download.|S
me013|things are slower there.|S
me011|definitely true.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me013|okay.|F
me011|any other items?|Q
me013|so okay so that's the meeting stuff|D
me013|uh|D
me013|so you're we're you said it was almost half.|S
me013|so that means that we have like eighty or so hours.|S
me013|and out of that maybe thirty five or something are transcribed.|S
me018|yeah the the pie chart shows actually meetings that are|D
me018|uh|F
me018|it combines the categories of you know currently in|D
me018|oh well i've got it right there i think.|S
me011|i i saw the pie chart sticking out.|S
me018|yeah there's there's just a few uh|D
me011|so|F
fe008|do you want to write on the on the board?|Q
me018|um yeah.|S
me018|except i i'm tethered.|S
me011|do we care?|Q
me013|he's tethered yeah.|S
me018|uh|F
fe008|i could write on the board.|S
me018|okay.|S
me018|it combines categories.|S
me018|so when we say transcribed we mean either in the process of being transcribed either here or at i b m.|S
me013|oh.|B
me013|yeah.|B
me018|or completed transcription.|S
me018|and it also includes uh checked.|S
me018|so it includes a lot of categories together.|S
me013|i see.|S
me018|so|F
me011|we need different color pens definitely.|S
me018|and that i think that that status thing is kind of old actually right now.|S
me013|oh that's|D
me013|yeah that's not half.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe008|last updated in july.|S
me018|that one that you have?|Q
fe008|oh i'm not sure the one that i saw on the web when i came back.|S
fe008|okay.|S
me018|yeah.|S
me018|the|D
me011|rustle rustle.|S
me018|the date on this one is july twenty sixth.|S
me018|so uh i have to update it.|S
me013|a couple weeks ago yeah.|S
me018|yeah.|B
fe008|okay.|F
me013|but about how much do we have that's sort of uh|D
me018|so we have total number of meetings is seventy eight meetings.|S
me018|and uh uh|F
me018|the total meeting time is seventy five hours.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
me018|and um so|F
me001|oh.|D
me018|the ones that are finished being transcribed as opposed to in the process of being transcribed|D
me018|we've got twenty six hours that are finished being transcribed.|S
me011|oh great.|S
me001|what does that mean?|Q
me001|finished being transcribed.|S
me018|um so there's uh several processes to the transcription.|S
me018|there's uh|D
me018|it ranges from being assigned to a transcriber to them finishing transcription to then being checked.|S
me018|you know with a double check.|S
me001|uhhuh.|B
me018|and so when we say the total transcribed that's the one that's gone through being checked i believe.|S
me018|i think that's what the i have here.|S
me001|okay.|S
mn014|just not yet approved for|D
me018|but not yet approved.|S
mn014|yeah okay.|S
me018|and then there's uh the final one is approved for release.|S
me011|oh.|S
me018|that's after the meeting participants have gone through it.|S
me011|so i should probably send those to you.|S
me011|shouldn't i?|Q
me001|oh.|S
fe008|yes at present there's none of those are on the pie chart.|S
me018|yeah if you know|D
me018|yeah currently that's zero released uh|D
me011|there are five.|S
me018|huh?|Q
me011|there are five.|S
fe008|there're five?|Q
fe008|good.|S
me011|we have five where uh everyone has replied.|S
me018|okay.|S
me018|okay so we have five that are potentially releasable then.|S
fe008|so the the cross hatching there is um is|D
fe008|it's been through the double check.|S
fe008|right?|Q
fe008|i mean it's this is the it's been|D
me018|yeah that's approval in progress.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe008|everything on the|D
me018|yeah.|B
fe008|so i mean it's|D
fe008|when i add a couple more from that uh that were done in my absence i think that we'll be down to about there.|S
fe008|so it's not quite as close to half as i'd thought.|S
fe008|but it's you know|D
fe008|it's more than a|D
fe008|and so these right here have been through the double check.|S
fe008|these haven't.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe008|oh how nice of you.|S
fe008|holding holding the thing so i'm not|D
me011|it was falling off uh|D
fe008|yeah thank you.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me013|okay.|S
me013|uh all right so we still have a long ways to go.|S
me013|but maybe the uh the i b m thing will will help push through the the rest of it somewhat quicker.|S
me013|okay.|S
me011|and there's still uh two people for whom i have not been able to get in touch|D
me011|have never gotten a response from from any of the emails about uh permission forms.|S
me011|so|F
fe008|are they from one of the foreign language ones?|Q
me011|yep.|S
fe008|i mean|D
fe008|okay good.|S
me011|that's so that's why the n s a ones have still not been approved though.|S
fe008|those will figure less prominently in things anyway.|S
me011|yep.|S
me013|yeah it might it might partly just be european summer vacation issues.|S
me011|possibly it's been like four months.|S
me011|so|F
me013|oh.|S
me001|wow!|S
mn017|uh you know those europeans.|S
mn017|they got a lot of|D
fe008|long vacations.|S
me013|right huh.|S
me013|okay.|S
me013|uh what else is going on?|Q
mn014|you|D
me013|why don't we just go around?|Q
me013|because we only have a few minutes.|S
mn014|didn't you want to say something about the hardware set up?|Q
me011|oh that's right.|S
me011|uh|F
me011|yeah we have new hardware.|S
me011|so i want to set it up at some point.|S
me011|so i just wanted to know what meeting schedules were.|S
me013|what new hardware?|Q
me011|uh we have several more wireless channels.|S
fe016|uhhuh.|B
me011|so that we can set up.|S
me011|and get rid of these uh the wired stuff completely.|S
me013|oh.|S
me011|and then also we got replacements for these mikes.|S
fe016|oh really?|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|so what's your question?|Q
me011|yeah.|S
me001|oh.|B
fe016|are they like these?|Q
me011|yeah they're like those.|S
fe016|right?|Q
me011|those are the only two choices right now unfortunately.|S
fe016|okay.|S
me013|so what's your question?|Q
me011|question is when are we not recording any meetings for a couple days?|Q
me011|so that i can do it.|S
me011|and if it doesn't work we won't impact people.|S
me013|well there's a point when a bunch of us are off at eurospeech.|S
me011|so|D
me013|um|F
me011|so what's smartkom?|Q
mn014|nothing this week.|S
mn014|maybe end of next week.|S
me011|end of next week.|S
me011|and is e d u still recording?|Q
fe016|they usually do thursdays.|S
fe016|i don't get a lot of advance notice.|S
fe016|but it's always been either mondays or thursdays.|S
fe016|so|F
me018|thursdays?|Q
fe016|yeah they they often do it after.|S
me011|so if i did it like tomorrow that would be all right it sounds like.|S
fe016|for a while they were doing it after this meeting.|S
me018|oh!|S
fe016|yeah wednesdays fridays|D
me011|okay.|S
me011|so it sounds like no one|D
fe016|definitely definitely wednesday i'm not here.|S
fe016|so i don't record anything.|S
me011|no one early next week.|S
mn014|yeah let me check with robert again.|S
mn014|but i i'm pretty sure that there's nothing this week.|S
me011|okay.|S
me013|okay.|B
me011|and then i'll also re number.|S
me011|so that uh the mikes are in order.|S
fe008|oh thank you thank you.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me013|okay.|S
me011|should help with the transcripts.|S
me013|right.|S
me011|they so right now the channel numbers are discontiguous.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
me011|right.|B
fe008|yeah i mean you know it's an extra step.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me013|okay.|B
me013|so i was just thinking maybe just go around and just briefly look what's other things that are going on.|S
me013|maybe since we don't don't have much of a set set agenda.|S
me013|and we don't have much time.|S
me013|uh|F
fe016|but feel free to overlap.|S
me011|okay we'll all say what we're doing at the same time.|S
fe016|no i mean i always get scared when you do these portions where you're not going to overlap.|S
fe016|because there's less data points.|S
me013|well why don't we we we deliberately pick two people to|D
fe016|i mean people could like backchannel.|S
fe016|and ask questions and stuff.|S
me013|yeah.|S
me013|i'll i'll i'll keep saying uhhuh yeah.|S
fe016|okay.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|this is absolutely natural meetings.|S
me013|we have absolutely no effect from our preconceptions.|S
mn017|so we had|D
fe016|right.|B
mn017|the the transcribers have trouble with your backchannel.|S
mn017|because|D
me013|with my backchannel?|Q
mn017|yeah with your backchannels.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
mn017|because sometimes you have this sort of this this uhhuh that you don't|D
mn017|so there's uh huh.|S
mn017|and then there's aha.|S
fe016|uhhuh.|B
mn017|and it's not quite clear always what what it is you mean.|S
me011|which uhhuh?|Q
me013|which one it is?|Q
mn017|yeah.|S
fe016|but i don't think it's aha.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
fe016|it's more like uh huh.|S
fe016|rather than uhhuh.|S
mn014|i'm|D
mn014|yeah.|B
mn017|yeah.|B
me001|yeah.|B
mn014|i don't like the backchannels at all.|S
mn014|as that's really a problem with the speech nonspeech detection.|S
me001|yeah let's get rid of them.|S
mn014|so|F
me011|that's a|D
me013|well has anybody done anything?|Q
me013|come on.|S
me013|what are we doing?|Q
me011|i mean i'll start if you want.|S
me011|i've been uh most recently rewriting transcriber in java for no particular reason.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe008|well for speed.|S
me011|uh|F
me011|well i mean what happened was that transcriber's very slow to load.|S
me011|so when you have a big meeting it uh especially on a slower machine it can take five minutes before you can start doing anything.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me011|and so i was thinking about why that was.|S
me011|and the data structures i would use.|S
me011|and i found myself unable not to sit down and code it.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me011|so i did.|S
me011|and so i have a big chunk of transcriber now written in java.|S
me011|and it comes up you know in a couple of seconds.|S
me011|um|F
mn017|do you take do you take feature requests?|Q
me001|cool.|S
fe016|great great.|S
fe016|yeah we should talk to you off line about something.|S
me013|well wait a minute.|S
me011|i it's not really probably not worth doing.|S
me013|what|D
mn017|that would|D
mn017|well actually i think it is worth doing.|S
me011|but we can talk about it.|S
fe016|yeah.|S
mn017|because here's the thing we're sort of we're starting to move from transcription to annotation.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
mn017|and the transcriber interface is fine if essentially what you're doing is stringing words together to to make transcripts.|S
me011|annotating.|S
me011|yep.|S
mn017|but um in for instance what we're doing now with uh communicator data but which we would like to do with meeting data is to actually label utterances or words or whatever units you want with uh you know basically doing a multiple choice type of labelling.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
mn017|and for those type of tasks it it's much more efficient to present uh the present a bunch of uh clickable buttons or whatever.|S
me011|yeah.|B
me011|buttons.|S
fe016|uhhuh.|B
mn017|and um|F
fe016|but it has to be multi stream.|S
fe016|they|D
fe016|in other words the beginning of something could be one speaker.|S
fe016|and the end of that unit like question answer pair could be a different speaker.|S
fe016|that's why we can't just annotate the transcripts uh one listening to one at a time.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
fe016|so so that's why the transcriber's nice for sort of listening to it.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
fe016|but you can't actually encode um encode|D
me011|yeah i i understand the problem.|S
fe016|yeah exactly.|S
me011|so|F
fe016|so|F
mn017|and and that's actually a good model which is what this current tool that we're using has is to to associate these labels with um attributes of s g m l tags.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
mn017|so you know you have say a tag for|D
mn017|i don't know.|S
mn017|what type of utterance?|Q
mn017|whether it's a question or a statement or whatever.|S
mn017|and then you have an uh you know an a tag attribute.|S
mn017|and the value of that encodes the choice.|S
me011|right.|B
me011|right.|B
me011|so what i don't have with it so far is it doesn't play wavefiles.|S
me011|and it display wavefiles.|S
me011|i just haven't done that.|S
me011|since that that part wasn't|D
mn017|oh you mean display as in showing the waveform.|S
me011|yep.|S
mn017|okay.|S
me011|yep.|S
me011|and uh and then also a lot of the fancy user interface stuff that's in transcriber i haven't done.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me011|but it works.|S
me013|what's uh the original transcriber written in?|Q
me011|tcl t k.|S
me013|i see.|S
me011|so|F
me013|so|F
me018|are you using|D
me011|which is nice and flexible.|S
me011|but very very slow in comparison.|S
me013|yeah yeah right.|S
me018|are you using the|D
me018|oh you oh you are.|S
me018|we already talked about that.|S
me018|the x m l reading|D
me011|yep sax.|S
me018|sax yeah.|S
me011|because it's much faster than dom and uses less memory.|S
me018|right right.|S
me011|so|F
me011|and then uh|D
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me011|preparing for quals.|S
me011|uh hopefully second week of september if i can ever get warren sack to answer my emails.|S
me011|i probably shouldn't say that on the tape.|S
me013|beep.|S
me011|yeah oh well.|S
me011|i got to remember to beep that out.|S
me018|who was that?|Q
me011|so anyway so i've been preparing for that.|S
me013|not answering your calls huh?|Q
me011|and uh|F
me011|actually i wanted to say off line with you about any literature reviews i should do beforehand.|S
me013|war and peace.|S
me011|war and peace.|S
me011|that's a good choice.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me011|keep me busy.|S
me013|yeah.|S
fe016|it's actually not a bad idea to say beep as a word.|S
fe016|because you can search the transcripts you know for for that to find these places.|S
me011|for beep.|S
me011|that's a good idea.|S
fe016|no i'm i'm totally serious to have one word like beep.|S
me011|no absolutely i agree.|S
fe016|especially with a really long eee like that.|S
me013|yeah.|S
fe016|works great.|S
me013|i'll i'll take that role anytime you want.|S
me013|i like saying it.|S
me013|so|F
me013|okay.|S
mn014|yeah i've been doing a bunch of recognition experiments on meeting data with different uh segmentations with different different automatic segmentations.|S
mn014|but it's not yet finished.|S
mn014|it's work in progress.|S
me013|okay any sense about how how it does on|D
mn014|yeah for uh for for the paper i i want to submit to a s r u to to uh evaluate the quality of the speech nonspeech detection by using it for speech recognition.|S
me013|right but i was just asking if you had a sense yet of of uh whether|D
me013|maybe you already did this experiment.|S
me013|where there's this question of of how much it hurt you or helped you to use segmented versus|D
mn017|yeah but we didn't have the exact comparison.|S
mn014|it|D
mn017|but you know there were|D
mn017|the experiments were based on different segmentations and different transcripts.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
mn017|so we weren't quite sure which whether the difference came from different transcripts for instance.|S
mn017|and so thilo's|D
mn014|so it hurts compared to the ideal segmentation when you have the the manual segmentations.|S
mn014|where you have exact boundaries for each utterances.|S
mn014|sometimes there are some some words are cut off.|S
mn014|or there's some segments are uh assigned to to speech which there is nothing in.|S
mn014|and so there are more insertions.|S
mn014|but most of the time there are more the the number of deletions is higher when when you use the automatic segmentation compared to the ideal one.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
mn014|and so i'm just in in progress of yeah trying to feed the recognizer with un segmented data.|S
mn014|and to see how much worse that is.|S
mn014|so that that i have three things.|S
mn014|yeah un segmented the automatic and the the ideal one.|S
me013|yeah.|B
mn017|but the recognizer's putting up some resistance.|S
mn017|because it doesn't like the un segmented data.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me013|uhhuh.|B
me001|um yeah i just got back from chicago.|S
me001|so|F
me001|um fishing went pretty well.|S
me011|oh yeah all of us are banging.|S
me013|good good.|S
me001|and um i was going to post some results you know with uh|D
fe016|wisconsin fishing.|S
me011|with fishing|D
me001|wisconsin fishing yeah.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me001|uh.|F
me013|so your so your results are about the same as bush's.|S
me011|you should have seen the one that got away?|Q
me013|basically his|D
me001|who yeah right.|S
me001|whose result?|Q
me013|bush's.|S
me013|yeah you're both you know sort of he's he's coming back to the heartland.|S
me013|and|F
me001|yeah right exactly.|S
me001|i did my tour of the heartland.|S
me013|yeah.|S
me018|did you build any houses?|Q
me001|yeah.|B
me001|yeah i built a few built a few houses.|S
me001|um|F
me001|but right now i guess uh i'm working on this paper this isca paper for this workshop that liz and andreas and i are putting together.|S
me001|so we're just getting uh different results for|D
me001|um we fixed up our different uh transcripts with different types of uh annotations.|S
me001|and we re ran re ran alignments.|S
me001|and we're going to develop a new feature database based on those alignments.|S
me001|and do some trees and analysis.|S
me001|so i'm kind of in the middle of that.|S
me001|and|F
me001|hopefully by the twentieth the twenty third.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
fe016|twentieth.|S
me001|the twentieth!|S
me001|yeah we'll have it all straightened out.|S
mn017|yeah.|B
me001|so it's going to be a busy week.|S
mn017|yeah.|B
mn017|you know i'll bet you know bush went on this european trip recently.|S
mn017|and they told him there that they get more vacations.|S
me001|uhhuh.|B
me013|yeah.|B
mn017|so he came back here and thought oh i i can afford some more vacation too.|S
fe016|beep!|S
me013|yeah i i think he's he's been he will have been off like two months out of his first seven in office.|S
me001|yeah it's amazing.|S
mn017|yeah it's hard to keep concentration you know.|S
me013|that's a pretty good deal.|S
mn017|and the focus on the|D
me018|don't even really notice.|S
me018|do you?|Q
me013|anyway.|S
mn017|um.|F
mn017|so while he's vacationing um we've been uh|D
mn017|well basically this is like a joint effort.|S
mn017|uh we were just|D
me013|who are you talking about?|Q
me013|bush or don.|S
me013|yeah.|B
mn017|um|F
mn017|you know apart from getting preparing the the the data for the|D
mn017|um for these experiments for the um uh for this prosody workshop.|S
mn017|we just um we just had a phone call with mari and her students in fact.|S
mn017|and they want to um they're bringing up their own meeting recognizer.|S
mn017|which is based on bill byrne's uh recognizer from johns hopkins.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
me013|based on hub five or like like your|D
mn017|based on their hub five recognizer.|S
fe016|uhhuh.|B
mn017|and uh|F
me013|yeah.|B
mn017|so they've been getting from us the um you know some support in terms of getting the latest transcripts.|S
mn017|and the also the actually the uh transcripts annotated with events.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
mn017|uh like sentence boundaries and stuff like that.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
me013|yeah.|B
mn017|um because one of mari's students was to wants to do some language modeling for uh predicting overlaps and uh stuff like that.|S
me013|yeah.|B
mn017|um|D
fe016|yeah actually we had this from the last time that they were here that it'd be nice to have u w do some work on language modeling that would be trying to get at the same detection as what we do acoustically.|S
me011|can i borrow a piece of paper?|Q
fe016|since they can ramp up much quicker in the language modeling.|S
me011|thank you.|S
fe016|and we you know we'll do the uh prosodic side.|S
fe016|and so this is supposed to be a project that we could actually integrate the posteriors that they get from their language model for every word boundary or every frame boundary.|S
fe016|and then train up the classifiers.|S
me013|yeah.|B
mn017|uhhuh.|B
mn017|uhhuh.|B
fe016|and it's i guess it's an undergrad too that that's going to be doing this work.|S
me001|cool.|B
mn017|yeah.|B
fe016|so|F
mn017|um on the recognition side actually um i think the main person doing that is uh harriet from harriet nock from uh formerly of cambridge.|S
me013|yeah.|B
mn017|um and apparently they get reasonable results.|S
mn017|except in some portions they get very high insertion rates.|S
mn017|even higher than we get with with the um like even you know on lapel mikes with uh background speech.|S
mn017|and so they were trying to track that down.|S
mn017|and|F
mn017|it could be that our recognizer's actually doing relatively well.|S
mn017|because it has a reject model for you know mismatched speech essentially.|S
mn017|or for unspecified speech.|S
mn017|and um so|F
me013|oh!|S
mn017|so uh they'll i sent them our recognition output.|S
mn017|so they can sort of do a line by line comparison.|S
mn017|and see if if they um you know their insertions correspond to our rejects and stuff like that.|S
mn017|so um we'll see what that uh leads to.|S
mn017|um|F
mn017|yeah other than that uh|D
mn017|we're well that's pretty pretty much it as far as meetings are concerned.|S
me013|yeah i mean we're doing uh|D
me013|so i should mention dave and i have sort of been pushing through thinking in terms of an a s r u paper.|S
me013|but i'm still|D
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|i think early next week we'll decide whether we'll we'll do one or not.|S
me013|um but because you know the results are are still confusing enough that that um|D
me011|uhhuh.|B
me013|we got to be convinced we understand what's going on.|S
me013|but it's starting to look like it it's almost the opposite of the usual situation where um you get some really nice result with uh with digits say.|S
me013|and then you go to a large corpus and the result goes away.|S
me013|um we had what looked like a good result in digits but but then when we went to more training data that kind of went away.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|so uh the digits result right now is kind of equivocal.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|um but the conversational speech one while not huge is in sort of hub five or meeting kind of terms.|S
me013|actually it's it's it's not bad.|S
me013|you know?|Q
me013|so so it's it's you know it's like|D
mn017|right.|B
me013|after he did some adjustments more like a percent or so that that absolute that it goes goes down.|S
me011|yeah it's a p h d.|S
me013|and|F
mn017|but is it still true that basically the speaker adaptation um sort of negates much of the advantage?|Q
me013|yeah.|S
me013|no i'm talking about with the adaptation.|S
mn017|with it.|S
me013|without the without the adaptation is a much bigger effect.|S
mn017|okay.|S
me013|so so it's it's very reasonable to think of as an alternative way of getting this kind kind of improvement.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|but i think what ultimately what we have to face with it is that um|D
me013|i mean he gets incredibly good results if you artificially reverberate clean you know close close miked data.|S
me011|right.|B
me013|so i think the thing we really have to face is that our model for what's going on is is wrong.|S
me011|is it wrong?|Q
mn017|right.|B
me013|or incomplete.|S
me013|and that in this situation in particular there's a lot of noise.|S
mn017|right.|B
me013|and noise plus reverberation is not at all the same as just reverberation.|S
me013|so um uh there's that one thing that been thinking of doing is there's a whole lot of work that's been going on in noise suppression in the in the aurora uh team.|S
me013|and so uh they've got some software.|S
me013|and i'm think of of just having us integrate that in.|S
me013|uh because it|D
me011|just combine it see.|S
me013|yeah because it just i mean it just subtracts it out.|S
me013|in fact in fact you can run it in sort of enhancement mode where you get speech out.|S
me013|and and and uh then just run it through the rest of your recognizer.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|so so uh um|F
mn017|yeah.|B
me011|neat.|S
me013|so we're working on that.|S
mn017|okay.|B
mn017|there's some work um that|D
mn017|do you remember this paper or poster by um some c m u folks at uh h l t?|Q
mn017|they were talking about|D
mn017|and and they they referred to an upcoming i cassp paper i think at the time.|S
mn017|someone in karlsruhe i think um worked on uh you know estimating noise from the silent regions.|S
mn017|and then uh doing some explicit|D
mn017|i don't know if it's something akin to parallel model combination or something like that to to uh|D
me013|i mean people have done that for a long time.|S
me013|right?|Q
mn017|right anyway uh so i i i couldn't judge whether this was original or not.|S
mn017|but but it seemed like they got pretty good results on their meeting data.|S
mn017|so we might want to look into that.|S
me013|yeah i i don't remember the paper.|S
mn017|right.|B
me013|but i mean that that's certainly one of the common techniques is to do that.|S
mn017|right.|B
me013|uh and in all the stuff that our team is doing they certainly look at regions that you think are nonspeech in order to get noise statistics.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|but uh|F
mn017|right.|B
me013|i mean there's a host of different things you could do.|S
me013|in the aurora thing we have we have a little bit of a handicap in that they they don't let you uh adjust the the statistical models.|S
me013|so you have to you have to do everything at the feature level.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|um but um um|F
me013|but there's uh you know wiener filtering and spectral subtraction.|S
me013|which are uh sort of can be looked at as minor modifications of one another.|S
me013|um|F
me013|and they've now built up a nice piece of software that does|D
me013|um|F
me013|has this sort of general framework for a for it.|S
me013|so that you can adjust it to sort of any any any one of a dozen ways that people have done this kind of thing.|S
me013|and|F
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|they found a particular set of parameters they liked this week.|S
me013|and we're running with that for a while.|S
me013|but|F
mn017|okay.|B
me013|anything else?|Q
fe016|so well i'll just really briefly um|D
fe016|so i've been working with don and also and and andreas on the this paper on prosody.|S
fe016|and what we're trying to do is predict where people at|D
fe016|given all information up to whatever point in time you're considering try to predict if that's a good location for someone else to jump in.|S
fe016|so that's the idea of that paper.|S
fe016|and that's the same task that mari um a student named dustin and also sarah who was at this last meeting will be looking into doing from the language modeling side.|S
fe016|maybe some kind of you know clustered class n gram or something.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe016|um and also we're we're using a couple of the labelers who are doing emotion to help us um finalize some transcripts for this.|S
fe016|so these undergrad students are really helping us out a lot.|S
me001|yeah.|B
fe016|under don's supervision actually.|S
fe016|so that's good.|S
me001|right.|B
fe016|so these offices are being uh very busy.|S
fe016|don's and the one across from him.|S
fe016|and then also um working with jeremy on communicator emotion labelling.|S
fe016|and most of that up to a few weeks ago was just getting the people labelling these utterances to a computer for emotion.|S
fe016|and that's going pretty well now.|S
me013|what kind of emotions do you label?|Q
fe016|um|F
fe016|well we're mostly looking for places where the person's frustrated with the system.|S
me013|so there's just two categories frustrated and not.|S
me013|or no?|Q
fe016|there there are actually that's how we started it.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe016|and we had different levels.|S
fe016|now we have things like amuse.|S
fe016|like oh you finally got it.|S
fe016|um and disappointed tired like yeah no that's wrong again.|S
fe016|which isn't really mad.|S
fe016|but you know.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe016|so they gave me a lot of feedback the labelers after doing this.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe016|told me what they wanted as categories.|S
fe016|and then there's jokes.|S
fe016|and|F
me013|yeah.|B
fe016|yeah right.|B
fe016|um|F
fe016|there's not a lot of enough frustration for us to really go through quickly.|S
fe016|because we have to label every meeting.|S
fe016|and also things like repeats for the same information and so forth.|S
fe016|and i've been coordinating a little bit with katrin at uh u w who was doing user correction work that she presented at the at the meeting.|S
fe016|so there's some overlap there in what you|D
fe016|there's a correlation between corrections and annoyance or frustration.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe016|um but jeremy's been starting to actually really work on that project now from the acoustic side.|S
fe016|so we have all these wave forms.|S
fe016|and he's been with morgan's help and uh dan ellis's i think looking into spectral tilt a bit.|S
fe016|so he can talk about that.|S
fe016|it's a feature we haven't used before.|S
fe016|um and starting to uh take information from alignments.|S
fe016|and create a database that we can use sort of as a a large feature vector or table to feed to our decision trees.|S
fe016|which will try to give us back an answer from the speech only as to whether the person's frustrated or not.|S
me013|that reminds me of something.|S
fe016|so|F
me013|we we talked about something a ways back and i sort of lost track of it.|S
me013|about having a synthesizer driven with|D
mn014|yeah.|B
mn014|i haven't really had time to do that.|S
fe016|actually i wanted to talk with you about that.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
fe016|because there's a similar project at s r i where we're using we want to do something like that to look at whether or not some of the stylized pitch stuff is um sort of perceptually similar to the kinds of things that people would mark.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
fe016|so i i actually wanted to talk to you about that.|S
mn014|yeah.|S
mn014|maybe after wednesday?|Q
fe016|so|F
fe016|okay yeah because this will be like after|D
me013|yeah because you have this a a s r u deadline.|S
mn014|yeah yeah.|B
fe016|okay yeah this will be after september anyway.|S
mn017|right.|B
me013|but that seemed like it would be fairly straight forward that if you take the take the pitch from the real data feed it into the synthesizer and then process the output with a gain box that you also had energy from the from the real data.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
fe016|so i|D
mn014|yeah.|B
fe016|right.|B
mn014|yeah.|B
fe016|yeah there was just no way to use the energy in festival that was|D
mn017|hey we could use that in the english|D
mn017|we have to do the english synthesis for smartkom.|S
mn017|what if we make the system really annoyed?|Q
fe016|anyway i i should move on.|S
fe016|because we're running late.|S
me013|yeah.|S
fe016|but i wanted to say there's one question in my mind which maybe morgan can talk to jeremy about is how to sort of normalize spectral tilt?|Q
fe016|it's just i'm sort of in this uh area i don't know much about.|S
fe016|and so we should talk off line.|S
me013|okay.|B
fe016|but if you have a certain speaker and you want to sort of get a bunch of data from that speaker but compare it you know directly on a feature to to like a decision tree that won't normalize anything for you once you feed it the features how do you sort of normalize over a particular speaker?|Q
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe016|what kinds of what what makes sense to do with that feature?|Q
me013|well i'll have to hear what he's using given different suggestions he's gotten.|S
fe016|so|F
fe016|yeah.|B
fe016|but that's something we would be glad to have help on.|S
me013|but|F
me013|okay.|S
fe016|so go ahead jeremy.|S
me051|right so i've been looking at spectral tilt.|S
me051|and different ways of perhaps generating it.|S
me051|and um i basically have three ways right now that we're looking at for uh we're going to look at for features.|S
me051|uh one is just looking at um the first cepstral coefficient.|S
me051|and uh using that.|S
me051|um another is looking at the log the difference of log energies between um the high like a high frequency band and a low frequency band.|S
me051|and the third is just um taking a slope um of the linear fit of the spectrum and using that.|S
me051|so those are the three three ways i have right now for generating these spectral tilt numbers.|S
me051|and um|F
me051|hopefully soon we can look at some of the labelled stuff.|S
me051|and look at uh these numbers and see see which ones seem to be working well and things like that.|S
me051|um i also recently wrote a script um that uh generates the kappa statistic.|S
me051|um which is a for labeler agreement.|S
me051|um so been looking at that as well.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me013|i mean wh what specifically what you want to do is remove the the the the average uh speaker tilt in some sense?|Q
fe016|the thing|D
fe016|yeah we we you want to use spectral tilt to try to get at the the voice quality of these utterances.|S
fe016|so you could have something like no versus no.|S
fe016|and these might differ in that way.|S
fe016|but the problem is we don't know we don't we don't know whether the no is frustrated or not.|S
me013|you don't know it|D
me013|yeah yeah.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
fe016|so|D
fe016|right exactly.|S
fe016|and then you also have the different speakers.|S
fe016|and so the sort of question is do you want to average all the data together or do you do you|D
me013|yeah.|B
fe016|you want to capture the change in voice quality within a speaker.|S
fe016|without having to know ahead of time which is which.|S
fe016|because that would be circular.|S
me013|i mean|F
fe016|so|F
me013|maybe maybe this is too obvious to be right.|S
fe016|this is|D
me013|but i mean the the the the normal thing for c one would be to to uh get rid of the mean and and the variance.|S
me013|right?|Q
fe008|to get rid of what?|Q
me013|does that the mean and variance have it be zero mean and unity variance.|S
me011|mean and variance.|S
fe008|okay.|S
fe016|but do you just do this say just in the vowel regions?|Q
me013|and then|D
fe016|and do you|D
fe016|there's there's a whole bunch of um sort of unknowns.|S
me013|right.|B
fe016|and we can try all of them.|S
fe016|and just put them into the tree as features.|S
me013|well the answer's yeah.|S
me013|i mean you want you want it for every place that's voiced.|S
fe016|and|D
mn017|but but you can't do it|D
mn017|i mean you can't just normalize it based on the utterance.|S
mn017|because then you're going to have zero everywhere.|S
mn017|right?|Q
mn017|so you'd have to normalize it based on the|D
me013|no everything for that speaker.|S
fe016|yeah.|S
mn017|yeah okay but that's not really feasible.|S
fe016|everything up to that point.|S
mn017|because you're having a you have a system a dialogue system where you only have access to the what the speaker said before.|S
me013|yeah.|B
mn017|so it'd have to be sort of a causal uh version of that.|S
fe016|oh yeah that's okay.|S
fe016|that that's the sort of we keep you keep uh you keep updating those numbers for future utterances.|S
me011|yeah.|B
fe016|that that would work.|S
me013|yeah i mean but but the main i think the main thing is that|D
mn017|or you|D
me013|the you're right i mean the main distinction is whether it's voiced or or voiced or not.|S
me013|if it's if it's if it's silence or or unvoiced regions then you you you don't really want that in there uh if you can help it.|S
fe016|yeah.|S
me013|but actually i mean just to first order suppose you just didn't do anything smart at all.|S
me013|and just did you know did that it wouldn't be that bad.|S
me013|because you'd get some number that would be skewed by be skewed by that|D
fe016|so you mean you're just using a mean and the and a variance.|S
me013|you know uh uh x x x x x x minus mu over sigma yeah.|S
fe016|you mean just a a z square?|Q
fe016|like|D
fe016|right right right okay.|S
fe016|so it is distributed in a way that you can do this yeah okay.|S
mn017|huh.|B
me013|it it it's it's sort of the first order thing to do.|S
me013|there's uh you know uh obviously much much more arcane things to do and complicated things to do.|S
fe016|okay so that's so that was our sort of.|S
me013|but that's that's the first thing to do.|S
fe016|maybe this will work.|S
fe016|i don't know.|S
me013|and then you know then the next thing is well let's just look at the voiced regions.|S
fe016|okay.|B
me013|you know and that would be a reasonable thing to do.|S
me013|and then if it's really when you look at what|D
me013|since you're looking at something that's sort of in log domain cepstral is like log linearly transformed of a log domain it's probably not that terrible an assumption to pretend it's gaussian anyway.|S
me013|and so the other things that get more more tricky are uh to handle the fact that it's not not really gaussian.|S
me013|and and you may you may not really need that for this.|S
fe016|well we probably won't get that far yeah.|S
me013|yeah so i think that would be that would be the obvious thing to do.|S
fe016|okay.|S
fe016|okay.|B
mn017|well we're not going to build a parametric model of the of the of the feature.|S
fe016|yeah.|B
mn017|right?|Q
mn017|we're just going to we're going to use like thresholding or something.|S
me013|no i understand.|S
me013|it's just it it|D
me013|no it's more that that if you felt something wasn't gaussian and you were trying to .normalize for some kind of uh bias of some sort you might use a non parametric measure.|S
mn017|right right okay.|B
me013|like you might use a median.|S
fe016|median yeah.|S
mn017|right.|B
me013|you know.|S
me013|and rank statistics and all that sort of stuff.|S
fe016|we could just plot plot these for a speaker.|S
me013|but i mean you shouldn't bother with it if it's roughly gaussian.|S
fe016|and|F
fe016|get a bunch of histograms.|S
mn017|right.|B
me013|just|D
me013|yeah.|S
fe016|okay.|B
mn017|okay.|S
fe016|right.|B
mn017|uh yeah.|B
fe016|thanks.|S
me013|sure.|S
me013|uh and i already i already said what i was doing.|S
me013|which is mostly trying to give advice to dave when he he he actually does the real work on this uh reverberation thing.|S
me013|but i think it's it's it's a real uh it's a real learning experience for both of us.|S
me013|and and uh i think it's it's a problem problem area that people really haven't dealt with that much as we know.|S
me013|so uh he kind of did he started off with what was in some sense sort of the first obvious thing to do.|S
me013|although hardly anybody had done it yet.|S
me013|and uh it it does work very well under some conditions.|S
me013|and other conditions it doesn't.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|and now we're understanding trying to understand what those are.|S
me013|it's it's it's fun.|S
me013|do you want to add anything to say anything?|Q
me011|she just got back.|S
me013|how was did you catch fish?|Q
me013|or|D
fe008|no.|S
me013|no no fish okay.|S
fe008|no.|S
me013|you know when bush catches fish.|S
me013|they actually put a bunch of fish in the lake for him.|S
fe008|oh.|S
fe016|really really hungry fish.|S
me001|it's part of the budget.|S
me013|i'm i'm not kidding.|S
me013|really they just they they pre stocked it with with a a|D
me011|the secret service is out there throwing fish into the ocean into the lake.|S
me013|i'm really not kidding.|S
me001|how they|D
me001|they got like scuba gear on and like hooking them?|Q
mn017|but they didn't tell her.|S
me011|uhhuh.|B
me001|uhhuh.|B
me011|hey i caught one this one and it's already cooked!|S
mn017|it you know to keep to keep us uh|D
fe016|it's already dead.|S
me013|yeah so we're ready to increase our federal funding.|S
me011|i think we're done.|S
me011|should we do uh simultaneous digits so that we actually have time for tea?|Q
me013|why why don't we|D
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|yeah let's do that.|S
mn017|okay.|S
mn017|huh.|B
me013|i still don't know if these are going to be any good.|S
me013|but it sure does get us out of here quicker.|S
me013|a one and a two and a three.|S
me011|ready?|Q
