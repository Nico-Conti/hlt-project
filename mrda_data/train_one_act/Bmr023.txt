me013|so i i had a question for adam.|S
me013|have we started already?|Q
fe016|well we started recording but yeah.|S
me013|yeah.|S
me013|is jane around?|Q
me013|or|D
me018|i saw her earlier.|S
me013|uh|B
fe016|she can just walk in i guess or|D
me018|i think|D
me018|yeah.|S
me013|right.|S
me018|she'll probably come up.|S
fe016|since we're starting late i figured we'd better just start.|S
me013|yeah great idea.|S
me013|i was going to ask adam to uh say if he thought anymore about the demo stuff.|S
me013|because it occurred to me that this is late may and the darpa meeting is in mid july.|S
me013|uh but i don't remember what we|D
me013|i know that we were going to do something with the transcriber interface is one thing.|S
me013|but i thought there was a second thing.|S
me013|anybody remember?|Q
fe016|well we were going to do a mock up like question answering or something i thought.|S
fe016|that was totally separate from the interface.|S
fe016|do you remember?|Q
fe016|remember like asking questions and retrieving but in a pre stored fashion.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
me013|right.|B
fe016|that was the thing we talked about i think before the transcriber|D
fe016|come on in.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me013|all right so anyway you have to sort out that out.|S
me013|and get somebody going on it.|S
me013|because we're got a got a month left basically.|S
me013|so|F
fe016|you like these.|S
fe016|right?|Q
fe016|okay good.|S
me013|okay.|F
me013|um|F
me013|okay so what are we else we got?|Q
me013|you got you just wrote a bunch of stuff.|S
fe016|no that was all um previously here.|S
me013|oh.|S
fe016|i was writing the digits and then i realized i could xerox them.|S
me013|oh.|S
me013|oh.|S
fe016|because i didn't want people to turn their heads from these microphones.|S
fe016|so|F
fe016|we all by the way have the same digit form for the record.|S
fe016|so|F
me013|that's cool.|S
fe016|yeah.|S
me013|so the choice is uh which which do we want more the the the comparison uh of everybody saying them at the same time or the comparison of people saying the same digits at different times that|D
fe016|it's just because i didn't have any more digit sheets.|S
me013|i know that.|S
fe016|so|F
me013|but you know which opportunity should we|D
fe016|yeah.|B
mn017|unison.|S
fe016|i mean it actually it might be good to have them separately and have the same exact strings.|S
me013|unison.|S
fe016|i mean we could use them for normalizing or something.|S
fe016|but it of course goes more quickly doing them in unison.|S
me013|i guess we'll see.|S
fe016|i don't know.|S
me013|i guess it's dependent on|D
fe016|see how long we go.|S
me013|how long we go and how good the snack is out there.|S
me013|yeah huh get some advance intelligence.|S
mn014|but anyway they won't be identical as somebody is saying zero in some sometimes you know saying o and so it's not not identical.|S
fe016|right.|S
fe016|right.|B
me013|yeah we'd have to train.|S
fe016|we'd be like a chorus.|S
mn014|okay.|S
me013|yeah we'd have to get get some experience.|S
mn017|greek chorus.|S
me001|yeah.|B
fe016|yes.|B
me013|yeah.|B
me013|really boring chorus.|S
me013|um do we have an agenda?|Q
me013|adam usually tries to put those together but he's ill.|S
me018|i've got a couple of things to talk about.|S
me013|so|F
me013|yeah.|S
me013|uh what what might those be?|Q
me018|uh i b m stuff and um just getting uh meeting information organized.|S
me013|meeting info organized.|S
me013|okay.|S
me013|um|F
mn017|are you implying that it's currently disorganized?|Q
me018|in my mind.|S
me013|is there stuff that's happened about um uh the s r i recognizer et cetera?|Q
me013|those things that were happening before with|D
me013|you guys were doing a bunch of experiments with different front ends and then with|D
mn017|well|F
me013|is is that still sort of where it was uh the other day?|Q
mn017|we're improving.|S
me013|we're improving.|S
mn017|yeah.|S
me018|now the the you saw the note that the p l p now is getting basically the same as the m f c c.|S
me013|right.|S
me018|right?|Q
me013|right.|B
mn017|yeah actually it looks like it's getting better.|S
me013|oh.|S
mn017|so but but it's not|D
me013|just with with age kind of.|S
mn017|with age yeah.|S
me013|yeah yeah.|B
mn017|but uh that's not directly related to me.|S
mn017|doesn't mean we can't talk about it.|S
mn017|um it seems it looks i haven't the it's the experiment is still not complete.|S
mn017|but|F
mn017|um it looks like the vocal tract length normalization is working beautifully actually.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
mn017|using the warp factors that we computed for the s r i system and just applying them to the icsi front end.|S
me013|that's pretty funny.|S
mn017|yeah.|B
fe016|so you just need to copy over to this one.|S
me013|okay.|S
mn017|just had to take the reciprocal of the number because they have different meanings in the two systems.|S
fe008|okay.|B
me013|uh!|S
me013|yeah well that's always good to do.|S
mn017|yeah.|B
me013|okay.|B
me013|okay|F
me013|uh|F
mn017|but one issue actually that just came up in discussion with liz and and don was um as far as meeting recognition is concerned um we would really like to uh move uh to uh doing the recognition on automatic segmentations.|S
me013|yeah.|B
mn017|because in all our previous experiments we had the uh you know we were essentially cheating by having the um you know the the hand segmentations as the basis of the recognition.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
mn017|and so now with thilo's segmenter working so well i think we should consider doing a|D
mn014|huh so.|B
me001|come on.|S
mn014|yeah we but|D
me013|think you think we should increase the error rate?|Q
mn017|uh doing|D
mn014|anyway yeah.|S
me013|good.|S
mn014|yeah.|S
mn017|yeah.|S
me013|yeah.|B
mn017|yeah.|B
mn014|that's what i wanted to do anyway.|S
fe016|yeah.|B
mn017|yeah.|B
mn014|so we should just get together and|D
mn017|yeah.|B
fe016|and even the good thing is that since you um have high recall even if you have low precision because you're over generating that's good.|S
fe016|because we could train noise models in the recognizer for these kinds of uh transients and things that come from the microphones.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
mn017|right.|S
mn014|yeah.|S
fe016|but i know that if we run recognition unconstrained on a whole waveform we do very poorly because we're we're getting insertions in places what that you may well be cutting out.|S
mn017|well|F
mn014|yeah.|B
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe016|so we do need some kind of pre segmentation.|S
mn017|we should we should consider doing some extra things like um you know retraining or adapting the the models for background noise to the to this environment for instance.|S
fe016|huh|B
fe016|yeah.|S
mn014|yeah.|S
fe016|and yeah using thilo's you know posteriors or some kind of or|D
mn017|so|F
fe016|right now they're they're discrete.|S
fe016|yes or no for a speaker to consider those particular speaker background models.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
fe016|so|F
mn017|right.|B
fe016|there's lots of interesting things that could be done.|S
mn014|yeah.|S
mn014|yeah we should do that.|S
fe016|so|F
me013|good.|F
me013|so uh why don't we uh do the i b m stuff?|Q
me013|you had some thing about that?|Q
me018|yeah so um talked with brian and gave him the alternatives to the single beep at the end of each utterance that we had generated before.|S
me013|right.|B
me018|and so|F
me013|the uh chuck chunks.|S
me018|yeah.|F
mn014|huh|B
me018|the chuck chunks.|S
me018|right.|F
me018|and so he talked it over with the transcriber.|S
me018|and the transcriber thought that the easiest thing for them would be if there was a beep and then the a number a digit and then a beep uh at the beginning of each one.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me013|yeah.|B
me018|and that would help keep them from getting lost.|S
me018|and um so adam wrote a little script to generate those style uh beeps.|S
me018|and so we're|D
mn017|where'd you get the digits from?|Q
me018|i came up here and just recorded the numbers one through ten.|S
fe008|they sound really good.|S
me018|so|F
fe016|that's a great idea.|S
me018|does it sound okay?|Q
fe008|yeah.|S
me018|so um yeah we just used those.|S
mn017|and do you splice them into the waveform?|Q
mn017|or|D
me018|yeah he then he i recorded actually i recorded one through ten three times at three different speeds and then he picked.|S
mn017|right.|B
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me018|he liked the fastest one so he just cut those out and spliced them in between uh two beeps.|S
mn014|it will be funny.|S
fe008|it sounds like a radio announcer's voice really.|S
mn014|uh|D
me018|does it?|Q
fe008|yeah yeah.|B
mn014|it will be funny when you're really reading digits and then there are the chunks with with your digits in.|S
me018|yeah with my|D
fe016|oh right.|S
fe008|oh that's right.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me018|that'll throw them.|S
fe008|now actually|D
me018|huh?|Q
fe008|we're are we handling|D
me013|uh maybe we should have you record a b c for those or something.|S
me018|huh maybe.|S
me018|and she said it wasn't going to the transcriber said it wouldn't be a problem because they can actually make a template uh that has beep number beep.|S
mn014|okay.|S
me018|so for them it'll be very quick.|S
me013|yeah.|S
me018|to to put those in there when they're transcribing.|S
me018|so um we we're going to send them one more sample meeting.|S
me018|uh and thilo has run his segmentation.|S
me018|adam's going to generate the chunked file.|S
me018|and then um i'll give it to brian and they can try that out.|S
me018|and when we get that back we'll see if that sort of fixes the problem we had with uh too many beeps in the last transcription.|S
me013|okay do do what do you have any idea of the turn around on on those steps you just said?|S
fe016|great.|B
me013|uh|F
me018|uh our our on our side?|Q
me018|or including i b m's?|Q
me013|including i b m's.|S
me018|well i don't know.|S
me018|the last one seemed like it took a couple of weeks.|S
me013|okay.|B
me018|um maybe even three.|S
me018|uh that's just the i b m side.|S
me018|our side is quick.|S
me018|i mean i i don't know how long does your|D
mn014|it should be finished today or something yeah.|S
me013|well i meant the overall thing.|S
me013|the reason i'm asking is because uh jane and i have just been talking and she's just been doing uh a you know further hiring of transcribers.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me018|uhhuh.|B
me018|uhhuh.|B
me013|and so we don't sort of really know exactly what they'll be doing how long they'll be doing it and so forth.|S
me013|because right now she has no choice but to operate in the mode that we already have working.|S
me018|right.|B
me013|and uh|F
me013|so it'd be it'd be good to sort of get that resolved uh soon as we could.|S
me018|yeah.|F
me013|and then|D
me018|i yeah i i hope we can get a better estimate from this one that we send them.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
me018|so um|F
me018|i i don't know yet how long that'll take.|S
me013|yeah um|F
me013|i mean in particular i would i would really hope that when we do this darpa meeting in july that we sort of have we're we're into production mode somehow.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
me013|you know that we we actually have a stream going and we know how how well it does and how and how it operates.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me013|i think that would that would certainly be a a very good thing to know.|S
me018|right right.|S
me013|okay.|B
me013|uh|F
me013|maybe before we do the meeting info organize thing maybe you could say relevant stuff about where we are in transcriptions.|S
fe008|okay so um we uh the transcribers have continued to work past what i'm calling set one.|S
fe008|which was the the set that i've been uh okay talking about up to this point.|S
fe008|but uh they've gotten five meetings done in that set.|S
fe008|right now they're in the process of being edited.|S
fe008|um the um|D
fe008|let's see.|S
fe008|i hired two transcribers today i'm thinking of hiring another one.|S
fe008|which will because we've had a lot of attrition.|S
fe008|and that will bring our total to|D
me013|they die off after they do this for a while.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
me018|burn out.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe008|well you know it's it's various things.|S
fe008|so one of them had a baby um you know one of them really wasn't planning|D
mn017|oh that was an unforeseen side effect of|D
fe008|uh one of them um had never planned to work past january.|S
fe008|i mean it's all these various things.|S
fe008|because we you know we presented it as possibly a month project back in january.|S
fe008|and and and and um|F
fe008|so it makes sense.|S
fe008|uh through attrition we we've we're down to to two but they're really solid.|S
fe008|we're really lucky the two that we kept.|S
fe008|and um well i don't mean i don't mean anything against the others what i mean is we've got a good cause a good core no we had a good core.|S
fe016|well they won't hear this since they're going they won't be transcribing this meeting.|S
fe008|yeah but still i mean i it's just a matter of we we're we've got uh|D
me013|no backs.|S
fe008|two of the ones who who um had been putting in a lot of hours up to this point and they're continuing to put in a a lot of hours.|S
fe008|which is wonderful and excellent work.|S
fe008|and so then in addition um i hired two more today and i'm planning to hire a third one with this within this coming week.|S
fe008|but but the plan is just as uh morgan was saying we discussed this and the plan right now is to keep the staff on the on the leaner side.|S
fe008|you know?|Q
fe008|rather than hiring like eight to ten right now.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe008|because if the i b m thing comes through really quickly then um we wouldn't want to have to uh you know lay people off and stuff.|S
fe008|so|F
fe008|and this way it'll i mean i got really a lot of response for for my notice.|S
fe008|and i think i could hire additional people if i wish to.|S
me013|yeah and the other thing is i mean in the unlikely event|D
me013|and since we're so far from this it's a little hard to plan this way.|S
me013|in the unlikely event that we actually find that we have uh transcribers on staff who are twiddling their thumbs.|S
me013|because you know there's you know all the stuff that that was sitting there has been transcribed and they're and they're faster the the pipeline is faster than uh than the generation.|S
me013|um|F
me013|uh in in the day event that that day actually dawns uh i i bet we could find some other stuff for them to do.|S
me013|so i i think that uh uh as we were talking if we if we hire twelve then we could you know run into a problem later.|S
fe008|oh yes.|S
me013|i mean we also just couldn't sustain that forever.|S
me013|but but um for all sorts of reasons.|S
me013|but if we hire you know we have five on staff five or six on staff at any given time then it's a small enough number so we can be flexible either way.|S
fe008|good.|S
fe008|okay.|S
me013|good.|D
fe016|it'd be great too if um we can we might need some help again getting the tighter boundaries.|S
fe016|or some hand to experiment with um you know to have a ground truth for this segmentation work.|S
fe016|which i guess you have some already that was really helpful and we could probably use more.|S
mn014|huh yeah that was a thing i i planned working on is uh to use the the transcriptions which are done by now and to to use them as uh|D
fe016|oh.|B
fe016|oh the new ones.|S
mn014|yeah.|S
fe016|with the tighter boundaries yeah.|S
mn014|yeah.|S
mn014|and to use them for for training a or for whatever yeah.|S
mn014|to to create some speech nonspeech labels out of them.|S
mn014|and yeah but that that's a thing was what i'm just looking into.|S
fe016|okay.|S
fe008|the the the pre segmentations are so much are so extremely helpful.|S
fe008|now there was uh i guess|D
fe008|so a couple weeks ago i needed some new ones and it happened to be during the time that he was on vacation.|S
fe008|for just very few days you were away.|S
mn014|yeah.|S
fe008|but it happened to be during that time i needed one.|S
fe008|so i so i started them on the non-pre-segmented and then switched them over to yours.|S
fe008|and um they um you know they always appreciate that when they have that available.|S
fe008|and he's uh usually uh uh um um|D
fe008|so they really appreciate it.|S
fe008|but i was going to say that they do adjust it once in a while.|S
fe008|you know once in a while there's something like|D
mn014|yeah sure.|S
fe008|um and actually you talked to them.|S
fe008|didn't you?|Q
fe008|did you have you|D
mn014|yeah.|S
mn014|i talked to helen.|S
fe008|and and and she was|D
fe008|and so i asked her|D
fe008|i mean they're very perceptive.|S
fe008|i really want to have this meeting of the transcribers.|S
fe008|i haven't done it yet but i want to do that.|S
fe008|and she's out of town um for a couple of weeks but i want to do that when she returns.|S
fe008|um because she was saying you know in a in a span of very short period we asked it seems like the ones that need to be adjusted are these these these things.|S
fe008|and she was saying the short utterances uh the um|D
fe016|huh|B
mn014|huh|B
mn014|yeah.|B
fe008|you know i mean you're you're aware of this.|S
mn014|yeah.|S
fe008|but but actually it's so correct for so much of the time that it's an enormous time saver.|S
fe008|and it just gets tweaked a little around the boundaries.|S
fe016|that's great.|S
fe008|so|F
fe008|um yeah i think it'd be interesting to combine these.|S
mn014|yeah.|S
fe016|is there actually a record of where they change?|Q
fe016|i mean you can compare do a diff on the|D
fe016|just so that we knew|D
fe008|you could do it.|S
fe008|it's it's complicated in that um hhh hhh|D
mn014|yeah.|B
mn014|actually when when they create new yeah new segments or something it will be uh not that easy.|S
mn014|but huh i think one could do that.|S
fe016|i mean if we keep a old copy of the old time marks j.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
fe016|just so that if we run it we know whether we're which ones were cheating.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
mn014|yeah.|S
fe016|and|D
mn014|that would be great yeah to know that.|S
fe008|there is a there is one problem with that and that is when they start part way through then what i do is i merge what they've done with the pre segmented version.|S
fe016|which one would be good.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
fe008|so it's not a pure it's not a pure condition.|S
fe008|what you'd really like is that they started with pre segmented and were pre segmented all the way through.|S
fe016|uhhuh.|B
fe008|and um i uh the|D
fe008|it wasn't possible for about four of the recent ones.|S
fe008|but it will be possible in the future.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
fe008|because we we're um|D
fe016|huh that's great.|S
mn014|it would.|S
mn014|yeah.|S
fe016|yeah as long as we have a record i guess of the original automatic one we can always find out how well we would do from the recognition side by using those boundaries.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
mn014|yeah.|B
fe016|um|F
fe016|you know a completely non cheating version.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
mn014|yeah.|B
fe016|also if you need someone to record this meeting i mean i'm happy to for the transcribers|D
fe016|i could do it or chuck or adam.|S
fe008|thank you.|D
me013|okay.|F
me013|so uh you were saying something about organizing the meeting info?|Q
me018|yeah so um uh jane and adam and i had a meeting where we talked about the reorganization of the directory structure for all of the meeting|D
me013|did you record it?|Q
me018|no.|S
me018|for all the meeting recorder data.|S
me018|we should have.|S
me018|um and so we've got a plan for what we're going to do there.|S
me018|and then jane also prepared a um started getting all of the the meetings organized so she prepared a a spreadsheet which i spent the last couple of days adding to.|S
me018|so i went through all of the data that we have collected so far and have.|S
me018|been putting it into uh a spreadsheet with start time the date the old meeting name the new meeting name the number of speakers the duration of the meeting comments you know what its transcription status is all that kind of stuff.|S
me018|and so the idea is that we can take this and then export it as h t m l and put it on the meeting recorder web page.|S
fe016|oh great.|S
me018|so we can keep people updated about what's going on.|S
me018|um i've got to get some more information from jane.|S
me018|because i have some some gaps here that i need to get her to fill in.|S
me018|but so far um as of monday the fourteenth um we've had a total number of sixty two hours of meetings that we have collected.|S
me018|and um|F
me018|uh some other interesting things average number of speakers per meeting is six.|S
me018|um|F
me018|and i'm going to have on here the total amount that's been transcribed so far.|S
me018|but i've got a bunch of|D
me018|uh that's what i have to talk to jane about figuring out exactly which ones have have been completed and so forth.|S
me018|but um this'll be a nice thing that we can put up on the the web site and people can be informed of the status of various different ones.|S
me018|and it'll also list uh like under the status if it's at i b m or if it's at icsi uh or if it's completed or which ones we're excluding.|S
me018|and and there's a place for comments so we can um say why we're excluding things and so forth.|S
me018|so|F
me013|now would the ones that um are already transcribed we we have enough there that|D
me013|you know we've already done some studies and so forth.|S
me013|and|F
me013|um shouldn't we go through and do the business of of having the um uh participants approve it uh for approve the transcriptions for distribution and so forth?|Q
fe008|um interesting idea.|S
fe008|in principle i i would say yes although i still am doing some the final pass editing.|S
fe008|trying to convert it over to the master file as the being the channelized version.|S
fe008|and it's yeah it seems like i get into that a certain way and then something else intervenes and i have to stop.|S
fe008|cleaning up the things like the uh uh places where the transcriber was uncertain.|S
fe008|and and doing spot checking here and there.|S
fe008|so um uh i guess it would make sense to wait until that's done.|S
fe008|um but but|D
me013|well let me put in another sort of a milestone kind of as as i did with the uh uh the the pipeline.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
me013|um we are going to have this darpa meeting in the middle of july.|S
me013|and i think it it'd be|D
fe008|yes.|S
me013|given that we've been we've given a couple public talks about it already spaced by months and months i think it'd be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available.|S
me013|um|F
fe008|it'll certainly be done by then yeah.|S
me013|right so we can we we want to be able to say here is a subset that is available right now.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
fe008|that's right.|B
me013|and that's has been through the legal issues and so forth.|S
fe008|that's right.|B
me013|so|F
fe008|yeah that's right so that|D
me013|okay?|Q
fe008|okay.|S
me013|so by before july.|S
mn017|and they don't have to approve you know an edited version they can just give their approval to whatever version.|S
fe008|well maybe|F
me013|well in principle yes but i mean if if if somebody actually did get into some legal issue with it then|D
mn017|yeah but i mean the editing will continue presumably if if errors are found they will be fixed.|S
mn017|but they won't change the the content of the meetings.|S
me018|content really.|S
fe008|well see this is the this is the issue subtleties.|S
mn017|so|F
fe016|well if jane is clarifying question question then you know how can they agree to it before they know her final version?|Q
fe008|the other thing too is there can be subtleties where a person uses this word instead of that word which could've been transcribed in the other way.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe016|thing|D
fe008|and and they wouldn't have been slanderous if it had been this other word.|S
fe008|you know?|Q
me013|it you know there is a point at which i agree it becomes ridiculous.|S
me013|because you know you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say you know that should be a period and not a question mark.|S
me013|right?|Q
me013|and you don't you there's no way that we're going to go back and ask everybody do you approve this uh you know this document now.|S
me013|so|F
me013|so i think what it is is that the the the the thing that they sign i i haven't looked at it in a while but it has to be open enough that it sort of says okay from now on you know now that i've read this you can use do anything you want with these data.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me013|and uh but i think we want to|D
me013|so assuming that it's in that kind of wording which i don't remember um i think we just want to have enough confidence ourselves that it's so close to the final form it's going to be in a year from now that they're|D
fe008|uhhuh.|S
fe008|i agree.|S
fe008|huh i totally agree.|S
me013|uh.|B
fe008|it's just uh a question of uh if if the person is using the transcript as the way of them judging what they said and whether it was slanderous then it seems like it's it's it needs to be more correct than if we could count on them re listening to the meeting.|S
fe008|because it becomes uh in a way a a uh a legal document.|S
fe008|if they've agreed to that.|S
me013|well i forget how we|D
me013|right i forget how we ended up on this.|S
me013|but i remember my taking the position of not making it so so easy for everybody to observe everything.|S
me013|and adam was taking the position of of having it be really straightforward for people to check every aspect of it including the audio.|S
me013|and i don't remember who won adam or me.|S
me013|but|F
fe008|well if it's only the transcript though i mean this this is my point that that|D
me013|uh the|D
me013|uh that's why i'm bringing this up again because i can't remember how we ended up.|S
fe008|then it becomes|D
me013|that it was the|D
me013|he wanted to do a web interface that would make it|D
fe008|well if it's just the audio|D
me013|that would give you access to the transcript and the audio.|S
fe008|well.|F
me013|that's what adam wanted.|S
fe008|uhhuh.|B
me013|and i don't remember how we ended up.|S
fe016|i mean with the web interface it's interesting because you could allow the person who signs to be informed when their transcript changes.|S
fe016|or something like that.|S
fe016|and i mean i would say no like i don't want to know.|S
fe016|but some people might be really interested.|S
fe016|and then in other words they would be informed if there was some significant change other than typos and things like that.|S
me013|you decided you were whispering satanic incantations under your breath when you were|D
fe016|i don't know what happened to the small heads thing.|S
fe016|but i um i'm just saying that like you know you can sort of say that any things that are deemed|D
me013|they disappeared from view.|S
fe016|anyway i mean i agree that at some point people probably won't care about typos but they would care about significant meaning changes.|S
fe016|and then they could be asked for their consent i guess if if those change.|S
fe016|because assuming we we don't really distribute things that have any significant changes from what they sign anyway.|S
mn017|that's|D
mn017|how about having them approve the audio and not the transcripts?|Q
fe016|oh my god!|S
me013|uh|F
fe008|that would be simpler.|S
fe008|if we could count on them listening.|S
fe016|but no one will listen to the hours and hours of|D
me018|talk.|S
mn017|well that's okay.|S
mn017|we just have to give them a chance to listen to it and if they don't that's their problem.|S
me001|that's|D
me001|huh huh.|B
fe016|you you|D
fe016|that's like|D
fe008|unfortunately uh in in the thing that they signed it says transcripts.|S
mn017|no i'm serious!|S
fe008|you'll be you'll be provided the transcripts when they're available.|S
mn017|really?|Q
me013|yeah.|S
fe016|i i think|D
me001|huh|B
mn017|huh|B
mn014|yeah.|B
fe016|that's a lot to ask for people that have been in a lot of meetings.|S
fe008|yeah.|B
fe008|yeah.|B
me013|anyway haven't we we've gone down this path a number of times i know this can lead to extended conversations and and not really get anywhere.|S
me013|so let let me just suggest that uh off line that uh the people involved figure it out and take care of it before it's july.|S
fe008|yes.|S
me013|okay so so that in july we can tell people yes we have this and you can use it.|S
fe008|yes.|B
fe008|it's done ready available.|S
fe008|good.|B
me013|uh|F
me013|so let's see.|S
me013|what else we got?|Q
me013|uh don did did a report about his project in class.|S
me013|and uh an oral and written written version.|S
fe016|well.|B
me013|so that was stuff he was doing with you.|S
fe016|i mean it's i guess one thing we're learning is that the amount|D
me013|yeah.|B
fe016|we have eight meetings there.|S
fe016|because we couldn't use the non native all non native meetings.|S
fe016|and it's well probably below threshold on enough data for us for the things we're looking at.|S
fe016|because the prosodic features are very noisy and so you you need a lot of data in order to model them.|S
fe016|um so we're starting to see some patterns.|S
fe016|and we're hoping that maybe with i don't know double or triple the data with twenty meetings or so that we would start to get better results.|S
fe016|but we did find that some of the features that i jane would know about that are expressing sort of the distance of um boundaries from peaks in the utterance and some local um range pitch range effects like how close people are to their floor are showing up in these classifiers.|S
fe016|which are also being given some word features that are cheating because they're true words.|S
fe016|um so these are based on forced alignment.|S
fe016|word features like um word frequency.|S
fe016|and whether or not something's a backchannel and so forth.|S
fe016|so we're starting to see i think some interesting patterns.|S
me013|so the dominant features including everything were those those quasi cheating things.|S
me013|right?|Q
me013|where these are|D
me001|sometimes not.|S
fe016|i think it depends what you're looking at actually.|S
me001|yeah sometimes positions in sentences obviously or in spurts was helpful.|S
fe016|right.|B
me001|i don't know if that's cheating too.|S
fe016|um|F
mn017|spurts wouldn't be.|S
mn017|right?|Q
fe016|spurts is not cheating except that of course you know the real words.|S
fe016|but roughly speaking the recognized words are going to give you a similar type of position.|S
me001|right.|B
me001|right would they give you the same number of words though?|Q
fe016|it's either early or late.|S
me013|right.|B
fe016|not exactly but|D
me001|but somewhat?|Q
fe016|yeah it should be.|S
me013|on the average.|S
fe016|well we don't know.|S
fe016|and actually that's one of the things we're interested in doing is a sort of|D
mn017|have you tried using just time as opposed to number of words?|Q
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe016|so|F
me001|i think uh|D
me001|just time position like when the word starts?|Q
mn017|yeah.|S
mn017|well no i mean time time position relative to the beginning of the spurt.|S
fe016|uh|B
me001|i don't know if that was in the|D
fe016|you know|D
me001|start.|S
fe016|yeah.|B
fe016|uh we didn't try it.|S
me001|yeah there's all these things to do.|S
fe016|but it's|D
me001|like there's a lot of different features you could just pull out.|S
mn017|yeah.|B
mn017|i mean that wouldn't be cheating because you can detect pause pretty well within the time.|S
me001|right.|S
fe016|right.|S
me013|how about time position normalized by|D
fe016|and it depends on speaking rate.|S
me013|yeah yeah.|B
fe016|speaking rate yeah.|S
fe016|yeah that's actually why i didn't use it at first.|S
me001|yeah.|B
me013|yeah.|B
fe016|but we one of the interesting things was|D
mn017|uhhuh.|B
fe016|i guess you reported on some punctuation type?|Q
fe016|finding sentence boundaries finding disfluency boundaries.|S
me001|yeah.|S
fe016|and then i had done some work on finding from the foreground speech whether or not someone was likely to interrupt.|S
fe016|so where you know if i'm talking now and someone and and andreas is about to interrupt me is he going to choose a certain place in my speech either prosodically or word based.|S
fe016|and there the prosodic features actually showed up.|S
fe016|and a neat thing|D
fe016|even though the word features were available.|S
fe016|and a neat thing there too is i tried some putting the speaker|D
fe016|so i gave everybody a short version of their name.|S
fe016|so the real names are in there.|S
fe016|which we couldn't use.|S
fe016|uh we should use i d's or something.|S
fe016|and those don't show up.|S
fe016|so that means that overall um it wasn't just modeling morgan or it wasn't just modeling a single person.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe016|um|F
fe016|but was sort of trying to uh get a general idea.|S
fe016|the model the tree classifier was trying to find general locations that were applicable to different speakers.|S
fe016|even though there are huge speaker effects.|S
fe016|so|F
fe016|the but the main limitation now is i because we're only looking at things that happen every ten words or every twenty words we need more more data and more data per speaker.|S
fe016|so|F
fe016|it'd also be interesting to look at the e d u meetings.|S
fe016|because we did include meeting type as a feature.|S
fe016|so|F
fe016|whether you were in a meeting recorder meeting or a robustness meeting did matter to interrupts.|S
fe016|because there are just fewer interrupts in the robustness meetings.|S
me001|uhhuh.|B
fe016|and so the classifier learns more about morgan than it does about sort of the average person.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe016|which is not bad.|S
fe016|it'd probably do better than um but it wasn't generalizing.|S
fe016|so it's|D
me013|yeah.|B
fe016|and i think don um well we have a long list of things he's starting to look at now over the summer.|S
fe016|where we can|D
fe016|and he'll be able to report on more things in the future.|S
fe016|but it was great that we could at least go from the you know jane's transcripts and the uh recognizer output and get it to this point.|S
fe016|and i think it's something mari can probably use in her preliminary report.|S
fe016|like yeah we're at the point where we're training these classifiers.|S
fe016|and we're just reporting very preliminary but suggestive results that some features both word and prosodic work.|S
fe016|the other thing that was interesting to me is that the pitch features are better than in switchboard.|S
fe016|and i think that really is from the close talking mikes.|S
fe016|because the pitch processing that was done has much cleaner behavior than than the switchboard telephone bandwidth.|S
mn017|better in what sense?|Q
fe016|um well first of all the pitch tracks are have less um halvings and doublings than than switchboard.|S
fe016|and there's a lot less dropout.|S
fe016|so if you ask how many regions where you would normally expect some vowels to be occurring are completely devoid of pitch information.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe016|in other words the pitch tracker just didn't get a high enough probability of voicing for words.|S
fe016|for for you know five|D
me013|huh.|B
fe016|there are much fewer than in switchboard.|S
fe016|so the missing we had a big missing data problem in switchboard.|S
fe016|and so the features weren't as reliable.|S
fe016|because they were often just not available.|S
fe016|so that's actually good.|S
me018|could it have to do with the the lower frequency cut off on the switchboard?|Q
fe016|maybe i mean the we had telephone bandwidth for switchboard.|S
fe016|and we had the annoying sort of telephone handset movement problem that i think may also affect it.|S
me018|huh.|S
fe016|so we're just getting better signals in in this data.|S
fe016|which is nice.|S
fe016|so|F
me013|yeah.|B
fe016|anyway don's been doing a great job .|S
fe016|and we hope to continue with um andreas's help and also some of thilo's help on this.|S
me013|great.|S
fe016|to to try to get a non cheating version of how all this would work.|S
mn014|yeah sure.|S
mn014|yeah.|B
me013|has has uh we just i think just talked about this the other day but has has anybody had a chance to try changing uh insertion penalty sort of things with the with the uh uh using the tandem system input for the|D
mn017|oh yeah i tried that.|S
mn017|it didn't um help dramatically.|S
me018|were they out of balance?|Q
mn017|the|D
me018|i didn't i didn't notice.|S
mn017|there were a little|D
mn017|the relative number of|D
mn017|i think there were a higher number of deletions actually.|S
me013|oh.|S
fe016|deletions?|Q
mn017|so you uh so actually it it preferred to have a positive uh negative insertion penalty.|S
mn017|which means that um|D
me013|uhhuh.|B
mn017|but you know it didn't change the|D
mn017|by adjusting that the um|D
me013|okay.|B
mn017|yeah the error changed by probably one percent or so.|S
mn017|but you know given that that word error rate is so high that's not a|D
me013|okay so that|D
me013|so that's so that's not the problem.|S
mn017|that's not the problem.|S
me013|yeah.|B
mn017|no.|S
mn017|but uh we just um|D
mn017|uh|F
mn017|you know chuck and i talked and the next thing to do is probably to tune the um the size of the gaussian system um to to this to this feature vector which we haven't done at all.|S
mn017|we just used the same configuration as we used for the for the standard system.|S
me013|huh.|B
mn017|and for instance uh dan dan just sent me a message saying that c m u used um something like ten gaussians per cluster.|S
mn017|you know each each mixture has ten gaussians.|S
me018|uhhuh.|S
me018|huh we're using sixty four.|S
mn017|and and we're using sixty four.|S
me018|right?|Q
mn017|so that's obviously a big difference.|S
me018|yeah.|B
mn017|and it might be way off.|S
mn017|and give very poorly trained uh you know gaussians that way.|S
me013|huh.|B
mn017|uh and poorly trained mixture weights.|S
mn017|so so we have|D
mn017|the turn around time on the training when we train only the a male system with uh you know our small training set is less than twenty four hours.|S
mn017|so we can run lots of uh basically just brute force.|S
mn017|try a whole bunch of different um settings.|S
me013|okay.|S
mn017|and uh with the new machines it'll be even better.|S
mn017|so|F
me013|yeah we get twelve of those.|S
me013|huh?|Q
mn017|yeah.|S
mn017|but the p l p features work um uh you know continue to improve the|D
me013|okay.|S
mn017|um|F
mn017|as i said before the uh using dan's uh uh vocal tract normalization option works very well.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
mn017|so um i ran one experiment where we're just did the vocal tract normalization only in the test data.|S
mn017|so i didn't bother to retrain the models at all.|S
mn017|and it improved by one percent.|S
mn017|which is about what we get with uh with you know just actually doing both training and test normalization um with um the uh uh with the standard system.|S
mn017|so in a few hours we'll have the numbers for the for retraining everything with vocal tract length normalization.|S
mn017|and so that might even improve it further.|S
me013|great.|B
mn017|so it looks like the p l p features do very well now with after having figured out all these little tricks to to get it to work.|S
me013|yeah.|B
mn017|so|F
fe016|wait so you mean you improve one percent over a system that doesn't have any v t l in it already?|Q
me013|good.|D
mn017|exactly yeah.|S
fe016|okay.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me013|okay so then then we'll have our baseline to to compare the currently hideous uh uh new thing with.|S
mn017|right|D
me013|but|D
mn017|right and and what that suggests also is of course that the current switchboard m l p isn't trained on very good features.|S
me013|yeah.|B
mn017|uh because it was trained on whatever you know was used uh last time you did hub five stuff.|S
mn017|which didn't have any of the|D
me013|right but all of these effects were like a couple percent.|S
mn017|uh|D
me013|right?|Q
me013|i mean the|D
mn017|well but if you add them all up you have uh almost five percent difference now.|S
me013|add all of them|D
me013|i thought one was one point five percent and one was point eight.|S
mn017|yeah and now we have another percent with the v t l.|S
me013|that's three point three.|S
mn017|um actually and it's|D
mn017|right it was it was there was|D
mn017|um|F
mn017|what's actually interesting is that with|D
mn017|um well you maybe another half percent if you do the v t l in training.|S
mn017|and then interestingly if you optimize you get more of a win out of rescoring the um uh the n best lists.|S
mn017|uh and optimizing the weights.|S
mn017|um uh than|D
me018|than you do with the standard?|Q
mn017|yeah.|S
me013|yeah but the part that's actually adjustment of the front end per se as opposed to doing putting v t l n in or something is it was a couple percent.|S
mn017|so|D
mn017|right.|S
me013|right it was it was there was there was one thing that was one and a half percent and one that was point eight.|S
me013|so and and|D
me013|let me see if i remember what they were.|S
me013|one of them was uh the change to uh because it did it all at once to uh from bark scale to mel scale.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|which i really feel like saying in quotes.|S
me013|because they're essentially the same scale.|S
fe016|yeah why did that|D
me013|but the but but but any individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|so that's why i wanted to look|D
me013|i still haven't looked at it yet.|S
me013|i i want to look at exactly where the filters were in the two.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|and it it's probably something like there's one fewer or one more filter in the sub one kilohertz band.|S
me013|and for whatever reason with this particular experiment it was better.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|one way or the other.|S
fe016|huh.|B
me013|um it could be there's something more fundamental.|S
me013|but it you know i i don't know it yet.|S
me013|and the other and the other that was like one and a half or something.|S
me013|and then there was point eight percent.|S
me013|which was|D
me013|what was the other thing?|Q
me018|well that was combined with the triangular.|S
me018|right?|Q
me013|yeah those those two were together.|S
me018|yeah right.|S
me013|we weren't able to separate them out.|S
me013|because it was just done in one thing.|S
me013|but then there was a point eight percent which was something else.|S
me013|do you remember the|D
me018|the low frequency cut off.|S
me013|oh yeah so that was that was uh that one i can claim credit for uh in terms of screwing it up in the first place.|S
me013|so that someone until someone else fixed it.|S
me013|which is that um i never put|D
me013|when|D
me013|we had some problems before with offsets.|S
me013|this this went back to uh i think wall street journal.|S
me013|so we we had uh|D
mn017|huh.|B
me013|everybody else who was doing wall street knew that there were big d c offsets in in these data in those data.|S
me013|and and and nobody happened to mention it to us.|S
mn017|huh.|B
me013|and we were getting these like really terrible results.|S
me013|like two three times the error everybody else was getting.|S
me013|and then in casual conversation someone mentioned uh well i guess you know of course you're taking care of the offsets.|S
me013|i said what offsets.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me001|uhhuh.|B
me013|and at that point you know we were pretty new to the data.|S
me013|and we'd never really like looked at it on a screen.|S
me013|and then when we just put it on the screen and wroop!|S
me013|there's this big d c offset.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|so um in p l|D
fe016|there was a like a hum or or when they recorded it?|Q
me013|no it's just it it's it's not at all uncommon for for recorded electronics to have different um d c offsets.|S
fe016|or just|D
fe016|huh.|S
me013|it's it's you know no big deal.|S
me013|it's you know you could have ten twenty maybe thirty millivolts whatever.|S
me013|and it's consistently in there.|S
me013|the thing is most people's front ends have pre emphasis with it with zero at zero frequency.|S
me013|so that it's irrelevant.|S
me013|uh but with p l p we didn't actually have that.|S
me013|we had we had the equivalent of pre emphasis in a a uh fletcher munson style weighting that occurs in the middle of p l p.|S
me013|but it doesn't actually have a zero at zero frequency.|S
fe016|huh.|B
me013|like uh uh typical simple pre emphasis does.|S
me013|we had something more fancy.|S
me013|it was later on.|S
me013|it didn't have that.|S
me013|so at that point i oh we better have a have a high pass filter.|S
me013|just you know just take care of the problem.|S
me013|so i put in a high pass filter at uh i think ninety ninety hertz or so uh for a sixteen kilohertz sampling rate.|S
me013|and i never put anything in to adjust it for different different sampling rates.|S
me013|and so well so you know the code doesn't know anything about that.|S
me013|and so this is all at eight kilohertz.|S
me013|and so it was at forty five hertz instead of at instead of at ninety.|S
mn017|huh.|B
me013|so um|F
me013|i don't know if dan fixed it or or uh what he|D
mn017|well he made it a parameter.|S
me013|he made it a parameter.|S
me013|so yeah i guess if he did it right he did fix it.|S
me013|and then and then it's taking care of sampling rate.|S
me013|which is great.|S
me018|what what is the parameter?|Q
me013|he had a|D
me018|is it uh just the lower cut off that you want?|Q
mn017|it's called uh h h.p.f.|S
me013|h|D
me013|yeah does h.p.f. on on his feature.|S
mn017|and but h.p.f. you know when you put a number after it uses that as the hertz value of the cut off.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
me013|yeah.|B
me018|oh okay.|S
mn017|so|F
me013|i mean frankly we never did that with the rasta filter either.|S
me013|so the rasta filter is actually doing a different thing in the modulation spectral domain depending on what sampling rate you're doing.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|which is another old old bug of mine.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|but um|F
me013|um so that that was the problem there was we we we had always intended to cut off below a hundred hertz.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|and it just wasn't doing it.|S
me013|so now it is.|S
me013|so that that helped us by like eight tenths of a percent.|S
me013|it still wasn't a big deal.|S
mn017|okay.|B
mn017|well but um well uh again after completing the current experiments we'll we can add up all the uh differences.|S
me013|oh yeah.|S
me013|but but i guess my my point was that that um the hybrid system thing that we did was uh primitive in many ways.|S
mn017|and and|D
mn017|right.|S
me013|and i think i agree with you that if we fixed lots of different things and they would all add up we would probably have a a a competitive system.|S
me013|but i think not that much of it is due to the front end per se.|S
me013|i think maybe a couple percent of it is as far as i can see from this.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|uh unless you call well if you call v t l the front en front end that's uh a little more.|S
me013|but that's sort of more both kind of.|S
me018|one experiment we should we'll probably need to do though when um at some point is since we're using that same the net that was trained on p l p without all these things in it for the tandem system we may want to go back and retrain.|S
me013|right.|S
me013|but|F
mn017|well that's what i meant in fact yeah.|S
me018|yeah yeah.|S
me018|for the tandem you know.|S
me018|so we can see if it what effect it has on the tandem processing.|S
mn017|so so the thing is is do we expect|D
me013|uhhuh.|B
mn017|uh at this point i'm i mean you know i'm wondering is it can we expect uh a tandem system to do better than a properly trained you know a gaussian system trained directly on the features with you know the right choice of parameters?|Q
me013|well that's what we're seeing in other areas yes.|S
me013|right?|Q
me013|so it's so|D
me013|um um|F
me018|so we but but we may not i mean if it doesn't perform as well we may not know why.|S
me018|right?|Q
me018|because we need to do the exact experiment.|S
mn017|right.|S
me013|i mean the reason to think it should is because you're putting in the same information and you're transforming it to be more discriminative.|S
me013|so um|F
me013|now the thing is in some databases i wouldn't expect it to necessarily give you much.|S
me013|and and part of what i view as the real power of it is that it gives you a transformational capability for taking all sorts of different wild things that we do.|S
me013|not just the standard front end.|S
me013|but other things like with multiple streams and so forth.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|and allows you to feed them to the other system with this through this funnel.|S
me013|um so i think i think that's the real power of it.|S
me013|i wouldn't expect huge huge improvements.|S
me013|um but it should at least be roughly the same and maybe a little better.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|if it's you know like way way worse then you know|D
mn017|right.|S
me018|so morgan another thing that andreas and i were talking about was|D
me018|so in the first experiment that he did we just took the whole fifty six uh outputs.|S
me018|and that's um basically compared to a thirty nine input feature vector from either m f c c or p l p.|S
me013|uhhuh.|B
me013|uhhuh.|B
me018|but one thing we could do is|D
me013|let let let me just ask you something.|S
me013|when you say take the fifty six outputs these are the final nonlinearity outputs?|Q
me018|yeah through the regular tandem outputs.|S
me013|and they're and|D
me013|through the k l t?|Q
me018|through the k l t.|S
me013|okay.|S
me018|all that kind of stuff.|S
me013|and so so then you do you use all fifty six of the k l t?|Q
me013|or|D
me018|that's what we did.|S
me018|right?|Q
me013|okay.|S
me018|so one thing we were wondering is if we did principal components and say took out just thirteen and then did deltas and double deltas on that|D
me013|yes.|B
me013|yes.|B
me018|so we treated the first thirteen as though they were standard features.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me018|i mean did dan do experiments like that to|D
me013|uh talk with stephane.|S
me013|he did some things like that.|S
me013|it was either him or carmen.|S
me013|i forget.|S
me018|huh.|B
mn017|uhhuh.|S
me013|i mean these were all different databases and different you know in h t k and all that.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me013|so it it may not apply.|S
me013|but my recollection of it was that it didn't make it better but it didn't make it worse.|S
me018|huh.|B
me013|but again given all these differences maybe it's more important in your case that you not take a lot of these low variance uh components.|S
me018|because in a sense the net's already got quite a bit of context in those features.|S
me013|yeah.|B
me018|so if we did deltas and double deltas on top of those we're getting sort of even more.|S
me013|which could be good or not.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me013|yeah.|S
me013|yeah worth trying.|S
mn017|but there the main point is that um you know it took us a while but we have the procedure for coupling the two systems debugged now.|S
mn017|and i mean there's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we're feeding the tandem features.|S
mn017|uh either generating them or feeding them to this to the s r i system.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
me018|yeah.|B
mn017|but|D
me013|there might be.|S
mn017|it's|D
me013|because that's a pretty big difference.|S
mn017|yeah.|S
me013|but|F
mn017|and i'm wondering how we can how we can debug that.|S
me018|yeah.|S
mn017|i mean how|D
mn017|um|F
me013|huh.|B
mn017|i'm actually quite sure that the feeding the features into the system and training it up.|S
me013|what if|D
mn017|that that i think that's this that's essentially the same as we use with the with the p l p features.|S
mn017|and that's obviously working great.|S
mn017|so um|D
me018|yeah there could be a bug in in the somewhere before that.|S
mn017|there we could|D
mn017|the another degree of freedom is how do you generate the k l t transform?|Q
me018|uhhuh.|B
me013|that's|D
mn017|right?|Q
mn017|we|D
me018|right.|S
me013|well and another one is the normalization of the inputs to the net.|S
mn017|yeah.|B
me013|these nets are trained with particular normalization.|S
me013|and when that gets screwed up it it can really hurt it.|S
me018|i'm doing what eric|D
me018|eric coached me through then that part of it.|S
me018|so i'm pretty confident in that.|S
me013|okay.|S
me018|i mean the only slight difference is that i use normalization values that um andreas calculated.|S
me018|from the original p l p.|S
mn017|right.|S
me018|which is right.|S
me018|yeah.|B
mn017|right.|B
me018|so i i do|D
me018|oh we actually don't do that normalization for the p l p.|S
me018|do we?|Q
me018|for the just the straight p l p features.|S
mn017|no the the s r i system does it.|S
me018|s r i system does that right.|S
mn017|yeah.|S
me013|right.|B
me013|well you might|D
me018|so that's that's another|D
mn017|so there's there is there is room for bugs that we might not have discovered.|S
me018|yeah.|B
me013|yeah.|B
me018|uhhuh.|B
me013|yeah i i would actually double check with stephane at this point.|S
mn017|but|F
me013|because he's probably the one here|D
me013|i mean he and dan are the ones who are at this point most experienced with the tandem.|S
me018|uhhuh.|B
me013|thing and there may there may be some little bit here and there that is not not being handled right.|S
me018|yeah it's hard with features.|S
me018|because you don't know what they should look like.|S
me018|i mean you can't just like print the the values out in ascii and you know look at them see if they're|D
me013|not unless you had a lot of time.|S
fe016|well|F
me013|and|D
fe016|uh and also they're not i mean as i understand it you you don't have a way to optimize the features for the final word error.|S
fe016|right?|Q
mn017|right.|S
fe016|i mean these are just discriminative.|S
fe016|but they're not um optimized for the final|D
mn017|they're optimized for phone discrimination.|S
fe016|right so it there's always this question of whether you might do better with those features if there was a way to train it for the word error metric that you're actually that you're actually|D
mn017|not for|D
me013|that's right.|S
me013|well the other|D
me013|yeah the|D
mn017|huh|D
me013|well you actually are.|S
me013|but but it but in an indirect way.|S
fe016|well right it's indirect so you don't know|D
me013|so what and you may not be in this case.|S
me013|come to think of it.|S
me013|because uh you're just taking something that's trained up elsewhere.|S
me013|so what what you what you do in the full procedure is you um uh have an embedded training.|S
me013|so in fact you the the net is trained on uh uh a uh viterbi alignment of the training data that comes from your full system.|S
me013|and so that's where the feedback comes all around so that it is actually discriminant.|S
me013|you can prove that it's it's a|D
me013|uh|F
me013|if you believe in the viterbi assumption that uh getting the best path uh is almost equivalent to getting the best uh total probability um then you actually do improve that by uh by training up on local local uh local frames.|S
me013|but um we aren't actually doing that here.|S
me013|because we did we did that for a hybrid system.|S
me013|and now we're plugging it into another system.|S
me013|and so it isn't it wouldn't quite apply here.|S
me018|so another huge experiment we could do would be to take the tandem features uh do s r i forced alignments using those features and then re do the net with those.|S
mn017|do|D
me013|uhhuh.|B
fe016|huh uh exactly exactly.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe016|so that you can optimize it for the word error.|S
me013|yeah another thing is since you're not using the net for recognition per se but just for this transformation it's probably bigger than it needs to be.|S
mn017|but|D
fe016|yeah.|B
me013|so that would save a lot of time.|S
mn017|and there's a mismatch in the phone sets.|S
me018|huh.|B
mn017|so you're using a a a larger phone set than what|D
me013|yeah actually all those things could could could could uh could affect it as well.|S
me018|yeah yeah.|B
me013|the other thing uh just to mention that stephane this was an innovation of stephane's which was a pretty neat one.|S
me013|uh and might particularly apply here given all these things we're mentioning.|S
me013|um stephane's idea was that um discriminant uh approaches are great.|S
me013|even the local ones given you know these potential outer loops which you know you can convince yourself turn into the global ones.|S
me013|um however there's times when it is not good.|S
me013|uh when something about the test set is different enough from the training set that that uh the discrimination that you're learning is is is not a good one.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|so uh his idea was to take as the input feature vector to the uh gaussian mixture system uh a concatenation of the neural net outputs and the regular features.|S
mn017|oh we already talked about that.|S
fe016|yeah that|D
me013|yeah.|B
me018|uhhuh.|B
fe016|didn't you did you do that already?|Q
mn017|yeah.|B
fe016|or|D
mn017|no but we we when when we when i first started corresponding with dan about how to go about this i think that was one of the things that we definitely went there.|S
fe016|oh that makes a lot of sense.|S
fe016|huh.|B
me013|yeah.|B
me013|yeah i mean i'm sure that stephane wasn't the first to think of it.|S
mn017|yeah.|B
me013|but actually stephane did it.|S
me013|and and and it helped a lot.|S
mn017|uhhuh and does it help?|S
me013|yeah.|S
mn017|oh okay.|S
me013|so that's that that's our current best best system in the uh uh in the aurora thing.|S
mn017|oh okay.|S
fe016|yeah that makes sense.|S
me013|yeah.|B
mn017|and do you do a k l t transform on the on the combined feature vector?|Q
fe016|as you should never do worse.|S
me013|i i uh missed what you said.|S
mn017|do you you do a k l t transform on the combined feature vector?|Q
me013|yeah.|S
mn017|okay.|S
me013|well actually i uh you should check with him.|S
me013|because he tried several different combinations.|S
mn017|because you end up with this huge feature vector so that might be a problem unless you do some form of dimensionality reduction.|S
me013|yeah i uh|D
me013|what i don't remember is which came out best.|S
me013|so he did one where he put put the whole thing into one k l t.|S
me013|and another one since the the p l p things are already orthogonalized he left them alone and and just did a k l t on the on the on the net outputs.|S
mn017|uhhuh.|B
me013|and then concatenated that.|S
mn017|huh.|B
me013|and i don't remember which was better.|S
me018|did he did he try to|D
me018|so he always ended up with a feature vector that was twice as long as either one of the|D
me013|no i don't know i i don't know.|S
me013|you have to check with him.|S
me018|yeah.|S
mn017|okay actually i have to run.|S
me013|i'm into big ideas these days.|S
fe016|yeah.|S
mn017|uh|F
fe016|we need to close up.|S
fe016|because i need to save the data and um get a call.|S
me013|not to mention the fact that we're missing snacks.|S
me013|yeah.|B
fe016|right.|S
fe016|did people want to do the digits?|Q
me013|uh|D
fe016|or um do them together?|Q
me013|um|F
me013|i i i think given that we're in a hurry for snacks maybe we should do them together.|S
fe016|i don't know.|S
fe016|should we just|D
fe016|okay.|S
fe016|i mean are we trying to do them in synchrony?|Q
fe016|that might be fun.|S
fe016|adam's not here so he's not here to tell me no.|D
me013|well it's it's it's not you know it's not going to work out.|S
me013|but we could we could just uh uh see if we find a rhythm.|S
me013|you know.|S
fe016|sure.|S
me013|what|D
me013|uh o s or zeroes?|Q
me013|we want to agree on that?|Q
fe016|maybe just whatever people would naturally do.|S
fe016|i don't know.|S
me013|oh but if we were a singing group we would want to decide.|S
me013|right?|Q
fe016|be harmony.|S
fe016|yeah yeah.|B
fe008|mine's identical to yours.|S
me013|we might|D
fe008|is that correct?|Q
fe016|sorry so i set up.|S
fe016|and we didn't have enough digit forms.|S
fe008|oh i see.|S
fe016|so i xeroxed the same one seven times.|S
me013|so these are excellent.|S
fe008|oh i see.|S
me013|why don't we do|D
me013|anyone have a problem with saying zero?|Q
fe016|no.|S
me013|is zero okay?|Q
fe008|yeah.|D
me013|okay.|S
me013|one and a two and three.|S
