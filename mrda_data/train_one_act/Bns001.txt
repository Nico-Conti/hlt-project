mn082|uh okay.|F
mn082|so then let's start with our weekly meeting.|S
mn082|the last time's uh we learned too much i believe.|S
mn082|so|F
mn082|uh today i have two topics.|S
mn082|and the first topic um we have a new member in our group.|S
mn082|miguel sanchez.|S
mn082|i believe everybody knows him very well in the meantime because he stayed here quite a little time.|S
mn021|hi.|S
mn082|and i think he is talking to everybody in the meantime.|S
mn082|so but anyway i would like that miguel sanchez will introduce himself a little bit concerning his background what he intend to do.|S
mn082|and because i discussing with him uh uh many things concerning uh his skills and what the n.s.a. group intends to do.|S
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn082|i hope there will be a match uh then for his future work.|S
mn082|and the second topic is then to discuss a proposal in much more detail.|S
mn082|i believe we still haven't left our starting position.|S
mn082|and um yesterday i also discussed with wilbert some things.|S
mn082|and i would like to focus on the question what problem we are going to solve with such a proposal.|S
mn082|not so will they have a common activity within the group itself and maybe with other partners outside.|S
mn082|but the technical problem.|S
mn082|but that's under the second topic.|S
mn082|so first i would like that miguel will told us a little bit about his skills and and uh his background.|S
mn021|okay.|S
mn021|okay.|S
mn021|thank you joe.|S
mn082|so please.|S
mn021|well i uh as all of you know i came from from spain.|S
mn021|from the uh polytechnic university of valencia.|S
mn021|and uh i um just finished my p.h.d. thesis about uh power saving techniques for wireless networking.|S
mn021|uh in fact i have developed an algorithm to control the radio frequency power uh of a wireless transceiver.|S
mn021|and uh i've been working also in routing issues especially in the so-called ad hoc wireless networks.|S
mn021|where uh you have a set of uh mobile nodes and no other infrastructure.|S
mn021|no base stations.|S
mn021|so all the routing functions are done by the node by the same nodes.|S
mn021|okay?|Q
mn021|so nodes act as both end points and routers.|S
mn021|uh|F
mn021|i've in the study for some time these kind of networks.|S
mn021|and uh in fact there are a lot of of research uh articles about this this kind of networks because you know uh huh infrastructure based network network has been a long topic of research.|S
mn021|so|F
mn021|for example routing on on wired networks is a a topic still to be researched.|S
mn021|but it has an important background.|S
mn021|but mobile this kind of mobile networks is a little bit uh newer.|S
mn021|especially because uh until not so long uh the the things were too heavy to have a computer a wireless transceiver on a more or less portable thing.|S
mn021|so with the advent of this new technology low power uh high uh processing capability and wireless uh networking capability in a really small package new kind of devices are are being built and are appearing in the market.|S
mn021|and uh well this is more or less what i have done.|S
mn021|and the kind of uh things i'm interested is more or less all around this these kind of networks.|S
mn021|but i could say uh in general mobile service is not only about uh these specific kind of networks.|S
mn021|but in general about uh services uh over mobile or services that can benefit from the uh capability of nodes to move around.|S
mn021|and uh well i i've been teaching now for twelve years uh at a computer sciences school in my university.|S
mn021|i've been teaching computer networks.|S
mn021|and well i am more or less uh knowledgeable about well t.c.p.i.p. networking i.s.o. uh networking.|S
mn021|and uh|F
mn021|well i'm i'm a computer guy.|S
mn021|so i'm really um well i can say uh proudly uh more or less computer skilled.|S
mn021|i mean uh operating systems uh programming languages uh networking.|S
mn021|so this kind of things i think i'm more or less well-trained.|S
mn021|so|F
mn021|this is i think um my first presentation.|S
mn021|next maybe next meeting i will uh do a small sketch about uh my past work and well presenting some a little bit more detailed approach with some schemes and and some things from previous talks so you can have a better idea of the kind of work i've been doing.|S
mn021|okay?|Q
mn082|uhhuh.|S
mn021|thank you.|S
mn082|so thanks miguel.|S
mn082|yeah we discussed it yesterday that you'll maybe will have a talk next tuesday.|S
mn021|yeah.|S
mn082|but give me a sign and send me an abstract so that i can announce it then for the next meeting.|S
mn021|yeah.|S
mn021|that's okay.|S
mn082|um|F
mn082|one short other topic is uh claudia did a lot of work concerning the web pages in the meantime.|S
fn083|oh.|S
fn083|okay.|S
mn082|and despite busy stuff with waivers and uh and visas and whatever uh she found the time to um write with what we discussed before and in the form of h.t.m.l. stuff.|S
mn082|and we want to put it on the web pages in the next days.|S
mn082|so i will send an email then to everybody that they should check their web pages whether they're aligned with um their own views and opinions of what we should what should be presented on the web pages.|S
mn082|and any feedback is then well appreciated.|S
mn082|no?|D
mn021|okay.|B
mn082|so|F
mn082|let's switch to the project proposal.|S
mn082|um i mentioned that it is still|D
fn083|uh.|F
fn083|sorry.|S
fn083|can i|D
mn082|yeah?|Q
fn083|maybe i can add something.|S
mn082|claudia|D
fn083|yeah if there's anything else which we what we could add on the web site.|S
fn083|so for example if you have a small abstract or some pictures or whatever about the work you did before what you are planning to do here that would be fine.|S
mn021|okay.|S
fn083|because now we can add some more stuff there.|S
fn083|or if you have something or if somebody has some slides or articles whatever he wants to be published there.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn082|then everybody sees the structure how it is uh structured really structured.|S
fn083|yeah.|S
fn083|and|F
mn082|then maybe you can easy offer some additional input which should be presented then on the web pages.|S
fn083|yeah it depends what what everybody wants to do.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn082|yeah.|B
fn083|so|F
fn083|about the projects will be something.|S
fn083|then about publications will be another point.|S
fn083|and yeah additional information about how is life in berkeley and yep i don't know some some hints some web sites or links which are useful when somebody arrives or stuff like that.|S
mn082|yeah it is.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B
mn082|half collection of necessary information.|S
mn030|but there's no personal homepage for everybody?|Q
mn030|or is it planned or not?|Q
mn082|yeah you can have|D
mn030|or|F
mn082|yeah you can have it.|S
mn082|because as uh uh uh|D
mn030|i'm not interested in this.|S
mn030|that makes work.|S
mn082|no.|S
mn082|but this is oh uh everybody's obliged to do it for his own you know.|S
mn030|yeah.|S
mn082|so there is not uh claudia is not the webmaster here to uh get the collection for for for everything.|S
mn030|okay.|S
fn083|oh oh no i'm not doing it for everybody.|S
mn082|so|F
fn083|but what i can|D
mn082|this is responsible for uh everybody's responsible for his own.|S
mn082|yeah.|F
fn083|yeah but but what is planned is that i do something like previous you know layout and give everybody the uh uh the possibility to the chance to put his content inside.|S
mn030|sure.|B
mn030|okay.|S
mn030|his name and so on.|S
fn083|so that the layout is for everybody the same.|S
mn030|yeah.|B
mn021|well like have a blueprint.|S
fn083|so about the projects and stuff.|S
mn030|okay.|B
mn030|uhhuh.|B
fn083|so there will be something.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn082|yeah.|B
mn082|okay.|S
mn082|thanks.|S
mn082|so|F
mn082|let's switch to the proposal.|S
mn082|i ask everybody whether read it in the meantime and understand everything.|S
mn082|yeah.|D
mn082|everybody say yes?|Q
mn082|yeah?|Q
mn030|yes.|S
mn082|yes.|S
mn082|okay.|S
mn082|um|F
mn082|from my point of view as i mentioned before we still in the starting position.|S
mn082|i think the four building blocks on the network level will have really a major impact on on current um available wireless networks and uh also for future generations.|S
mn082|and what the missing thing is really what kind of problem we are want to solve with such a project proposal.|S
mn082|and wilbert yesterday mentioned and he is right that what kind of maybe service we are really going to offer.|S
mn082|the linkage between such kind of application also interactive multimedia application and uh this kind of networking stuff is um maybe not very well aligned.|S
mn082|because there will be of course a portion of mobile access to such kind of application.|S
mn082|but i think that's not the majority.|S
mn082|and that is not the major focus of um this kind of um this kind of application anyway.|S
mn082|so i would like to to uh split in principle the discussions of what kind of application tsk um far away.|S
mn082|and i would like to more to focus if we have certain kind of vision concerning these building blocks and the network um what kind of problem we are going to solve.|S
mn082|what kind of uh um um glue between these four building blocks exists.|S
mn082|and what kind of synergy effects in principle as if they work and fit very well together exists for networking stuff.|S
mn082|and what kind of service could we provide in that area.|S
mn082|we will have these kind of uh really closely working together of these four building blocks.|S
mn082|so maybe uh wilbert you can start to oder to to tell the group about what you mentioned yesterday concerning certain kind of ideas.|S
mn082|maybe it's a brainstorming um of of these things.|S
mn082|and maybe we can comment later on these uh these ideas.|S
mn082|and i saw you still discuss with with uh mark right?|S
mn082|some stuff.|S
mn082|was it also related with with these things?|Q
mn081|no.|S
mn082|no.|S
mn082|okay it was.|S
mn081|this afternoon you mean?|Q
mn082|yeah.|S
mn081|no this was unrelated to to the things of yesterday and last weeks.|S
mn082|okay.|S
mn082|yeah yeah.|B
mn082|then maybe then one one uh sentence before.|S
mn082|i believe everybody fits very well in these kind of things.|S
mn082|because from the mathematical description with q.s. in advance me as an expert for quality of service and uh michael as an expert for uh m.p.l.s. and wilbert an expert for for multicast and uh i discussed with miguel it's uh maybe a little bit the shift to active routing.|S
mn082|but it is still in the area of routing.|S
mn082|so my idea is in principle to have independently of any funding independently of any outer contact such such a core activity in principle.|S
mn082|and we can see how much from the outer world can fit in.|S
mn082|first of all the first stage is the institution which is behind everybody.|S
mn082|that means uh k.p.n. in your case and siemens in our case.|S
mn082|and maybe then in the broader world here other partners registered in the proposal|D
mn082|tomorrow i will go to cisco for instance.|S
mn082|and i will discuss uh all this kind of things.|S
mn082|maybe they have certain additional activities and they're interested in the results before.|S
mn082|the benefit here is in principle that the results are available.|S
mn082|they are not restricted any way.|S
mn082|if you have your own common activity that makes a little bit more easier.|S
mn082|and uh if there is a technical linkage between such uh um between the outer world and us okay the better it is.|S
mn082|but anyway if we come to a certain kind of uh common work within the core of the n.s.a. group i think that's really beneficial to everybody.|S
mn082|and uh especially wilbert if you have in mind to go in the huh uh really from the project proposal view i think we can build it on this this core.|S
mn082|you know?|Q
mn082|and go to the outer world with and and and align it in a certain way.|S
mn082|for instance that it also fit maybe to k.p.n. and siemens and in other companies.|S
mn082|yeah.|F
mn081|yeah and this probably has to be a brainstorm right now.|S
mn082|yep.|S
mn081|um what i told joachim yesterday was that uh uh for my company the company i work for they are more interested in in an explicit service than in core technology.|S
mn081|me on the other hand i'm more interested in uh core service or core technology myself.|S
mn081|so i'm i was thinking about uh how i could combine the both of them.|S
mn081|k.p.n. was um they're interested in having uh like six people or something working on the project for one year.|S
mn081|or maybe uh three people working on the project for two years.|S
mn081|and have a kind of a demonstration uh for a specifically u.m.t.s. service.|S
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn081|i was thinking that um as a well not really a u.m.t.s. service but yesterday what i discussed with joachim was uh a little bit based on your ad hoc networking also.|S
mn081|that it would be interesting to have a kind of a device where you can switch from a wavelan technology to um u.m.t.s.|S
mn081|i think that's uh it's in in the future that will be a main competitor of uh of u.m.t.s.|S
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B
mn081|too like the the the lucent uh equipment has a huge scope already.|S
mn081|like five hundred feet or or even more sometimes.|S
mn081|so that's it's might be interesting for a service to walk into a building or whatever is available on that network.|S
mn081|you can switch from u.m.t.s. or uh uh to wavelan technologies.|S
mn082|huh.|B
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B
mn082|uh maybe i will write a few keywords on the on the whiteboard.|S
mn081|sure.|S
mn082|okay?|Q
mn081|of course it sounds strange for a company that does u.m.t.s. to switch to to be able to switch or provide the service to switch to wavelan.|S
mn081|but at the end it makes it easier for your and cheaper for your customers.|S
mn081|so if they don't do it somebody else will probably do it.|S
mn021|and you can build a a an a a double technology adapter too.|S
mn021|so you can market these double technology adapters.|S
mn021|and this can be a a potential uh um you know uh income too.|S
mn081|yeah.|S
mn021|because you just have to license uh uh wavelan technology.|S
mn021|you can build uh the whole thing.|S
mn081|yeah.|S
mn021|this u. u.m.t.s. wavelan mixed together.|S
mn081|and|D
mn081|yeah something like that could be possible.|S
mn081|maybe even a u.m.t.s. to wavelan gateway.|S
mn081|or i'm not sure if that's possible like u. if u.m.t.s. contains redirects or whatever like switches.|S
mn081|i'm not sure about it.|S
mn081|it could be.|S
mn021|huh.|B
mn021|i think they are using different uh radio technologies.|S
mn021|so uh at the physical level they're they're they are not compatible.|S
mn081|it's not a problem.|S
mn081|no but you could have a u.m.t.s. gateway that translates everything to that uh local.|S
mn021|yeah.|S
mn021|yeah.|S
mn081|if you will.|S
mn021|that that's right.|S
mn082|yet the basic idea is in principle to switch seamlessly between wireless lan technology whatever and u.m.t.s.|S
mn082|right?|Q
mn081|yes.|S
mn082|and you see the benefit that in principle the customer will save a lot of money.|S
mn082|because if in-house communication like wavelan or maybe i see it also in the american market some wavelan communication in the outer world will be available the and that is your assumption that the more cost uh extensive um u.m.t.s. connection could be principle used i would like to say over wavelan.|S
mn082|and then i have a normal wavelan connection right?|S
mn081|yes.|S
mn082|and the router and the wavelan connection goes into the core internet elsewhere.|S
mn082|and the connection is not dropped between this seamless hand off i would like to say.|S
mn081|uhhuh.|S
mn082|right?|Q
mn082|or what or|D
mn081|well.|F
mn081|if connection is lost i am i'm not sure if sometimes you'd simply have to drop a connection if you have outstanding connections.|S
mn082|what|D
mn035|yeah.|S
mn081|but that's uh one thing of the internet.|S
mn081|right?|Q
mn081|it's should be able to unplug a host bring it somewhere else and everything continues like it should be.|S
mn081|i'm not sure if it's uh if you really have to uh save a connection for all applications.|S
mn081|i i don't think so.|S
mn082|yeah but if this is the final goal.|S
mn082|it should be as much as possible available that you do not have to break the connection if you switch between the subnets' technology.|S
mn082|right?|Q
mn021|yeah but i i have a point uh regarding the this question is uh the cost function.|S
mn021|i mean.|F
mn021|uh|F
mn021|what about the user who is switching from one let's say zero cost area network to another network where he has to pay?|Q
mn021|it is okay for the service to continue when he uh switches from one network to another.|S
mn021|but probably the user wants to be aware that he's switching from one place from one network to another.|S
mn021|because maybe while he's uh having let's say a video conference uh over the the wavelan oh he's not paying any extra cost.|S
mn021|but when he continues with this service on the u.m.t.s. he's having to cover uh an important let's say an important cost or some cost non-null cost.|S
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|non-null.|S
mn021|so uh|F
mn021|this can be something that probably the user wants to be aware of.|S
mn021|of course this doesn't mean that the user wants the connection to be dropped when he switches to the uh uh from the zero cost area network to to the uh um non-null cost area network.|S
mn021|but maybe some users want to do this.|S
mn021|because they say okay.|S
mn021|i'm not willing to pay any back for this service.|S
mn021|because i'm just watching uh you know the sports news.|S
mn021|so if i switch if if because of my motion i'm switching or i'm going out of the coverage of the of the uh wave uh wireless uh local area network well i i want the service to be uh stopped.|S
mn021|and this can be some pattern then that some users will follow.|S
mn035|yeah.|S
mn082|yeah but if your|D
mn082|uh i believe everybody is aware about the u.s.a.i.a. architecture.|S
mn082|and uh this one is here this stuff is here also related to this kind what is mentioned there concerning the end system.|S
mn082|and in my uh considered end system there is a certain kind of policy concerning how to use subnets technologies and and all these kind of things.|S
mn082|how to use quality of service you know in advance.|S
mn082|because you have to pay for certain technologies and maybe for certain services.|S
mn082|and that should not be done automatically.|S
mn082|but it could be done automatically.|S
mn082|but nevertheless there must be a certain kind of um user interaction always possible that you could set up a certain kind of mini database how to deal with all these kind of things.|S
mn082|i think that's not a problem.|S
mn082|but uh what i i would like to ask wilbert here and we discuss it yesterday is it only the usage of that p.c.m.c.i.a. card where you have instead of g.s.m. today u.m.t.s. and instead of wireless lan today also wireless lan.|S
mn082|remember your four and one card uh concerning um|D
mn082|what is the name from|D
mn082|no.|S
mn082|dacom.|S
mn081|oh the one i have sitcom?|S
mn082|where you can enable four technologies and you plug in in your laptop.|S
mn081|yeah.|B
mn082|and then you have every four uh subnet layer technologies available in your laptop.|S
mn082|is that the problem?|Q
mn082|yeah that's not the problem.|S
mn082|right.|S
mn081|um|F
mn081|well the switching itself could be a problem.|S
mn082|why?|Q
mn081|well it's a depends.|S
mn081|maybe you are.|S
mn081|i don't know.|S
mn081|so that could be a topic for research.|S
mn082|yeah but this|D
mn081|so maybe you know more about it.|S
mn082|yeah but this is only the probing to figure out that you get at a certain location the information that a certain coverage of a certain subnet technology is available.|S
mn082|and if so then what miguel mentions then you add a certain kind of policy to switch or not to switch to this kind of technology.|S
mn081|yeah.|B
mn082|right?|Q
mn081|yes.|S
mn082|but this is end system related.|S
mn082|that's not network related.|S
mn082|i see no network related stuff within these in this uh idea.|S
mn081|um|F
mn082|it's only to set up|D
mn082|for me it's like a laptop to plug one p.c.m.c.i.a. and currently will have two p.c.m.c.i.a. cards and i compare g.s.m. with u.m.t.s.|S
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B
mn082|and today i would like to have g.s.m.|S
mn082|and then i have my g.s.m. connectivity.|S
mn082|and i cannot use it other technology.|S
mn082|only g.s.m. because the interfaces the driver interface does not permit me to switch between the between different technologies.|S
mn082|so if i want to go to wireless lan i have to stop my connection and put in my wireless lan p.c.m.c.i.a. card.|S
mn082|and then i can go on and set up the the same connection one more time.|S
mn082|and what you have in mind to do it a bit more seamlessly and that makes an only sense for me if both technologies in principle were close together in that sense for application.|S
mn082|for instance the application would be that i have my laptop here.|S
mn082|and i work here with with my device.|S
mn082|any kind of device.|S
mn082|and i work here in wireless lan area.|S
mn082|and then i go outside and want to go still on leaving the coverage of uh of the uh wireless lan.|S
mn082|and at a certain state the device uh receives certain signals that the coverage of u.m.t.s. or g.s.m. is available.|S
mn082|and at that state you automatically or based on the certain kind of user profile switched to the um u.m.t.s. or g.s.m. uh network.|S
mn082|that's the only senseful application.|S
mn082|from my understanding that means only to have a certain kind of control layer for the different drivers.|S
mn082|which you also mentioned as a u.s.a.i.a. architecture.|S
mn082|and uh then to do the switching for an existing stream or application between these uh transparently to this application between those uh these both technologies.|S
mn082|maybe there's more potential.|S
mn082|i don't see it.|S
mn082|but maybe you have a additional idea.|S
mn082|and i don't think that this end system device uh architecture which will come automatically.|S
mn082|and i believe there's a lot of activity throughout the world.|S
mn082|because this seamlessly communication is always mentioned elsewhere where you where you listen to.|S
mn082|so|F
mn082|uh|F
mn081|if if you can leave it out the network that will be really cool.|S
mn081|that's what you what i would like to do.|S
mn081|so|F
mn081|yes.|F
mn021|but when quality of service comes to the uh scene well i think we have a a bigger problem.|S
mn021|because maybe this this uh uh seamless migration cannot be seamless at all.|S
mn021|because maybe the the quality of service we are getting when we are connected to a certain network let's say high-speed networking cannot be sustained when we are switching to a different technology.|S
mn021|so this is another thing that is uh putting a little bit in more trouble our our scheme.|S
mn021|or|F
mn082|now i would like not to hear only three opinions.|S
mn082|but maybe there are also other opinions.|S
mn021|okay.|B
mn021|yeah.|B
mn021|oh sorry.|S
mn082|and maybe everybody should uh give a short|D
mn035|i think you|D
mn082|let us understand built for everybody and their whether their comments.|S
mn035|yeah.|B
mn035|i think we should|D
mn035|in this thing of seamless handoff or handovers should think more maybe in different layers?|Q
mn035|so one layer is having the seamless handover.|S
mn035|it's clear if a technology doesn't provide that quality of service you can't do magic and have it.|S
mn035|there are certain constraints on that.|S
mn035|it's true.|S
mn035|that's still in mind.|S
mn035|but for with the cases there there it is possible.|S
mn035|so that should be made possible then?|Q
mn021|uhhuh.|S
mn021|yeah.|S
mn021|yeah.|S
mn035|so|F
mn021|it can be done.|S
mn021|it is just huh uh trying to to to to to pinpoint the the possible problems.|S
mn035|yeah.|S
mn035|there are still enough problems in doing it.|S
mn035|yeah.|S
mn035|yep.|S
mn035|but it might be the wrong thing to promise uh ten megabits to everywhere.|S
mn035|there you are.|S
mn035|but saying okay if it's a if the technology is okay you can do it.|S
mn021|yeah.|S
mn021|in fact if you take the slower technology of the ones you are planning to to support you can offer this this uh this throughput as uh the minimum warranty you you can get.|S
mn035|yep.|B
mn035|yep.|B
mn035|yeah.|B
mn021|so if everybody is is asking for less than this minimum amount no problem at all.|S
mn021|but in this case maybe not too much effort should be put on providing this quality of service.|S
mn021|because you just have a usually a huge bandwidth compared on a a with what the user is is using.|S
mn035|yeah.|B
mn035|yep.|B
mn035|uhhuh.|B
mn021|i mean if you have a ten megabits bandwidth and the user is asking two kilobits per second of course you can uh build uh certain reserve mechanisms to warranty the user these two kilobits per second bandwidth.|S
mn021|but probably in it isn't it is not worth because you have so many uh available bandwidths that maybe uh it is not a problem.|S
fn083|huh?|Q
fn083|oh!|S
fn083|okay.|S
mn082|uh|F
mn082|okay.|S
mn021|oh okay.|S
mn082|good luck.|S
mn081|the the thing is that we are looking for a research topic on on those uh four areas.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|and the building blocks.|S
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|multicast not a topic.|S
mn081|so|F
mn081|so we|D
mn082|routing?|Q
mn081|so so we went through uh uh to through multicast.|S
mn081|so this architecture with|D
mn081|well at least no wireless environment or a mobile i.p. environment comparable to uh u.m.t.s. environments we really did not find any well difficulties there.|S
mn081|on the blackboard that is.|S
mn081|of course in real life there will probably be some problems.|S
mn021|have you have you read about this uh barwan project held at berkeley university?|Q
mn082|well what you the pointer the pointer you sent yesterday.|S
mn081|iceberg?|Q
mn021|yeah.|S
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|i i didn't find the time yeah to do so.|S
mn021|okay.|S
mn082|but|F
mn082|uh|F
mn081|you mean the iceberg project?|Q
mn021|barwan.|S
mn081|barwan of uh e.s.|D
mn021|barwan.|S
mn035|how's it start?|Q
mn081|i know there's one that's of uh randy katz.|S
mn021|uh it was another related project called daedalus.|S
mn081|yes.|S
mn021|and uh well it seems they what they were doing was some kind of uh things somehow similar to this.|S
mn081|they worked together little bit with nokia?|Q
mn021|uh don't know.|S
mn081|palo alto?|Q
mn081|mountain view?|Q
mn021|i i i i just uh take a a quick uh look at the at the thing.|S
mn021|because i i was uh read about this uh a long time ago.|S
mn021|and it the the latest report i i found was in nineteen ninety eight.|S
mn021|and in this report well they they they have uh some slides some uh papers some well a lot of things.|S
mn081|huh.|B
mn021|and well the main thing and the quick uh thing i i was uh looking at was a a video available in m. in m.p.g.m. peg format.|S
mn021|and uh|F
mn021|well what this video was presenting was a kind of test of of one guy with a portable computer moving across different networks.|S
mn021|so starting at the c.s. department at berkeley.|S
mn021|and then going out the street.|S
mn021|switching to the a campus wide network.|S
mn021|uh um i think it's a metricom uh network.|S
mn021|which is uh a test|D
mn082|a ricochet here right?|S
mn021|ricochet.|S
mn021|yeah.|S
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn021|that's right.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn021|and then finally switching to i think it was city p.d. or something like this.|S
mn021|okay?|Q
mn021|i as uh as the as the user is moving out of the of the coverage area of this second network.|S
mn021|and well what they have built is a a kind of uh proxy structure.|S
mn021|so they are they are putting most of the work of this adaptational layer on on the side of the proxies.|S
mn021|so the client or the server is not changed.|S
mn021|it is the proxy the one that does the work.|S
mn081|yeah.|B
mn021|okay?|Q
mn021|so you can even for example use|D
mn021|it's the same?|Q
mn082|uh we just discussed a lot about proxies.|S
mn021|oh okay.|S
mn082|that's a fun.|S
mn081|i like them.|S
mn081|so|F
mn021|okay.|S
mn021|i|D
mn021|it is just that that well maybe we can we can take a look at oh maybe a more in-depth look at this project.|S
mn021|just to see if we are doing the same or if we are doing something similar.|S
mn021|it would be important for us to to highlight the differences.|S
mn081|yeah.|S
mn021|because if not well they can say oh you are doing the same thing.|S
mn021|this was done now.|S
mn081|or maybe talk to them about operations they thought of but didn't touch yet.|S
mn021|yeah well we are close.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn082|uh maybe a few comments.|S
mn082|first of all um do you mind miguel to write the name of the project on the whiteboard?|Q
mn021|yeah.|S
mn021|no problem.|S
mn082|so that everybody|D
mn082|uh i i will send also the pointer which miguel sent to me to everybody so that everybody can take a look to this uh project.|S
mn081|i was|D
mn082|and uh i don't know what information is available.|S
mn082|because i didn't find the time currently to check it out.|S
mn030|it's a project of the u.c.|S
mn082|but first of|D
mn021|yeah.|S
mn030|oh yeah.|S
mn021|u.c. uh berkeley.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn081|when did you go through this?|Q
mn021|yeah.|S
mn021|i'll i you uh i seen uh uh reports from nineteen uh ninety six ninety seven and ninety eight.|S
mn081|because yesterday i was uh well coincidentally i bumped into this project here.|S
mn021|maybe the project|D
mn021|uh|F
mn081|it's funny.|S
mn082|uh sorry?|Q
mn082|uh do|D
mn081|yeah yesterday i was just surfing a little bit.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|S
mn082|uh.|S
mn081|and then from nokia i came to this that project.|S
mn082|uh.|S
mn082|okay.|S
mn082|i see.|S
mn081|so|F
mn082|yeah.|B
mn081|nokia research.|S
mn021|i think that that the leader was uh professor katz.|S
mn081|and then|D
mn082|okay.|F
mn081|that's right.|S
mn081|and he's also board in nokia research.|S
mn021|okay.|B
mn081|so|F
mn082|uhhuh.|S
mn082|then the second thing is that uh daimler-chrysler research here in palo alto as well as in germany ulm is doing in principle the same with a car.|S
mn021|uhhuh.|S
mn082|they have a specific antenna for uh g.s.m. oh g.p.s. and and for future extended g. uh g.s.m. networks and wireless lan and and other and other network technology.|S
mn082|in the roof of the car they have a lot of servers.|S
mn082|in the trunk of the car then they collect data how it is with handoff and all these kind of things.|S
mn082|and they are driving around the different areas.|S
mn082|and the same car exists here in palo alto uh based on wireless lan g.s.m. and 2x ricochet networks.|S
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn082|they collect the collect collecting a lot of data concerning the seamless handoffs and whether it works very well with speed.|S
mn082|and um|F
mn082|uh thomas is going to build mobile i.p. stuff in their servers.|S
mn082|uh|F
mn082|because they want to|D
mn082|so i think there is a lot of activities in the area.|S
mn082|uh|F
mn082|and my third uh comment is uh if we are going something in that direction that is quite different from this thing here.|S
mn082|but anyway maybe as a core technology with a real product in mind.|S
mn082|i see some difficulty because nobody currently has here certain kind uh of u.m.t.s. know how.|S
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn082|and you need it definitely.|S
mn082|because then it must be your uh bible i would like to say that you are very familiar with u.m.t.s. if you want to go in in that way.|S
mn082|and as far as i know the u.m.t.s. standardization is not finished yet.|S
mn082|ninety percent maybe or eighty percent.|S
mn082|i i'm not sure.|S
mn082|but uh|F
mn021|yeah.|S
mn021|let me let me ask you a question about uh u.m.t.s. or or third or possible generation wireless communication systems.|S
mn082|that|D
mn082|yeah.|S
mn021|uh from the point of view of the user uh is there uh something more that nnn that than more speed?|Q
mn021|is there any other advantage from the point of view of the user or of of the terminals?|Q
mn082|users of of u.m.t. s?|Q
mn021|yeah.|S
mn082|you can request certain kind of q.s.|S
mn082|you can even request it in g.p.s.|S
mn082|but it's not end to end quality of service.|S
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B
mn082|it is only um what the gateways get.|S
mn021|okay.|S
mn021|yeah.|B
mn082|and within the core network there are certain kind of tunnels set up in the core network itself of the access provider.|S
mn082|not the internet backbone core.|S
mn082|and you use certain kind of tunnel mechanism to combine in principle the base station cluster control.|S
mn082|but this is uh is controlled by a certain kind of node.|S
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B
mn082|and you have the gateway to the p.d.n. or the public data network.|S
mn082|and between both there's a certain kind of tunnel set up.|S
mn021|but in fact|D
mn021|but in fact now at the g.s.m. level what you have is that every voice channel you use provides a a a pretty fine fixed uh data speed.|S
mn021|so we can say that every voice channel has an an uh implied um quality of service.|S
mn021|which is nnn ninety six hundred bits per second.|S
mn021|full duplex.|S
mn082|you mean now for g.s. m?|Q
mn021|doesn't it?|Q
mn082|or|D
mn021|yeah.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn082|yeah.|B
mn021|so|F
mn082|yeah what is what means quality of service.|S
mn082|a certain degree.|S
mn082|right?|Q
mn021|yeah.|S
mn082|uh|F
mn082|sometimes we have some|D
mn021|no but um but not only because of of data speed.|S
mn021|but also about delay.|S
mn021|you know.|F
mn021|because g.s.m. networks were developed to uh with a voice service in mind.|S
mn021|uh delay is also considered in these networks.|S
mn021|so|F
mn021|uh in fact for every voice channel you have uh a pretty fine maximum uh delay and jitter and a a a specified um data speed.|S
mn021|so you can scale up scale up this uh this um thing by using several channels.|S
mn021|so in fact you have using just g.s.m. technology you have more or less the same building blocks as you can get uh with the u.m.t.s.|S
mn021|i mean that one thing is that the technology is a little bit different.|S
mn021|that uh the base station thing is different.|S
mn021|and maybe uh the the internal routing uh inside the network is different.|S
mn021|but from the point of view of the mobile things uh i'm not sure if if|D
mn082|it's packaged data oriented.|S
mn082|it's not really circuit switched.|S
mn082|in u.m.t.s. you have always g.p.s. as a a involvement in the core network.|S
mn082|you have in principle the path which still is available for for the g.s.m. network.|S
mn082|also they use in principle the same uh the same mechanism.|S
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn082|but you also have a uh packet oriented communication that's on the g.p.s. stuff.|S
mn082|and that's also related to u.m.t.s.|S
mn021|yeah but the you know it is also being uh developed this g. uh p. d.p.r.s. thing g.p.r.s. thing.|S
mn082|so|F
mn082|that is|D
mn021|which is uh uh packet data over g.s.m.|S
mn021|so|F
mn021|i mean uh i don't see that a a lot of difference.|S
mn021|we can expect a lot of differences uh from the uh mobile terminal point of view uh when uh u.m.t.s. be deployed.|S
mn021|what i'm trying to say is that is that well uh maybe uh it is not a big problem that any of us uh be uh um were um a u.m.t.s. expert.|S
mn021|because uh i i don't see it i think that the u.m.t.s. thing is more a technology issue than a research issue.|S
mn021|maybe i'm wrong.|S
mn021|just|D
mn021|um|F
mn082|no i think there's a lot.|S
mn021|explaining my|D
mn082|yeah.|F
mn082|i think there's a lot of research.|S
mn082|but the question is is this uh a research in which direction we are going?|Q
mn021|i mean to be done here.|S
mn082|and because|D
mn082|for|D
mn021|not not at the|D
mn021|of course you know i'm i i agree with you that there are a lot of things to be developed.|S
mn021|but but the point is that uh this is probably not here.|S
mn021|because uh well you know the the the orientation of our group which is uh networks services and applications not uh wireless technology or the underlying wireless technology.|S
mn030|you think more about hardware technology.|S
mn021|yeah.|S
mn030|so there is a lot of hardware to develop but not|D
mn021|you know radio frequency technology.|S
mn021|wide band uh c.d.m.a.|S
mn021|these kind of things all have a lot of things to be to be uh researched.|S
mn021|but uh i don't think this is not something we are doing here.|S
mn082|right.|S
mn082|but bear in mind the picture is a is a little bit different.|S
mn082|the picture i have in mind concerning u.m.t.s. is first of all if you use u.m.t.s. only for voice like you did it or are doing now for g.s.m. it's not worth to have this kind of network.|S
mn082|and currently in europe where it will be deployed first i believe it will be very hard in principle to get some money back if you have only for using it for voice.|S
mn021|voice.|S
mn021|yeah.|S
mn082|because they paid a lot of money.|S
mn082|so|F
mn082|what is the point?|Q
mn082|the point is that you use the u.m.t.s. to connect to the internet and have certain kind of services which are still not available up to now.|S
mn082|but the problem is if you have the internet content and you have maybe your small uh um device of maybe only evolution based for for these uh new technologies for for certain mobile phones then you have certain kind of problems.|S
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B
mn082|you know?|Q
mn082|because you cannot use these things.|S
mn082|and wap is not an answer for for these kind of things.|S
mn082|you know?|Q
mn082|so|F
mn082|the i believe there is a lot of research work.|S
mn082|and also if you see the end to end scope of the internet from the mobile node up to the certain kind of server correspondent node or whatever you call this destination then you have certain kind of models for instance for the quality of service and all these kind of things.|S
mn082|and then is u.m.t.s. only one link where you have certain kind of subnet layer technology.|S
mn082|and you have to match these things anyway.|S
mn082|it's like a normal ethernet.|S
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B
mn082|whatever you see it is only an additional subnet layer technology.|S
mn021|yeah.|B
mn082|and you have all the things mapped to the uh to to the to the the internet stuff in principle to this technology.|S
mn082|and furthermore you see that the trend is to put more i.p. technology really really i.p. technology and not certain kind of modifications and adaptations to their access network itself.|S
mn082|and|F
mn082|there's a lot of potential as i believe for for uh certain research work.|S
mn082|but the question is first of all do we have the competence to do something like that?|Q
mn082|first of all.|S
mn082|second we are not hardware builders in that sense to set up certain kind of end systems.|S
mn082|we can design them yeah from the protocol layering.|S
mn082|and and maybe have some simulations or whatever.|S
mn082|but isn't the final outcome really such a device?|Q
mn082|prototype linux based.|S
mn082|and we go around here and we have maybe a g.p.s. base station sponsored by ericsson.|S
mn082|since they are living not so far away.|S
mn082|and and maybe wavelan connection here.|S
mn082|now a testbed.|S
mn082|and then then figure out that it works?|Q
mn082|so that's my point.|S
mn081|well just to make the list a little bit longer.|S
mn082|yep.|S
mn081|um you could also think about uh session management.|S
mn081|i do along with uh the network applications and services uh as you might know.|S
mn081|it's a a|D
mn081|if you can do it in the end systems or at specific servers then i'm in favor of that.|S
mn081|but session management i mean uh the authentication if you go from one network to the other it's not solved.|S
mn081|uh|F
mn081|nobody really wants a a guest on your network.|S
mn081|unless you get some money through some way uh through some way.|S
mn081|then there is also the session management in the sense that a lot of these things at the barwan project as you said go through proxies.|S
mn081|there might be kind of handoffs at uh at proxies.|S
mn081|like the zip uh zip proxy that we also discussed before a little bit.|S
mn081|that that's i think also in the line of uh session management.|S
mn081|then there is this uh perfect thing uh the berkeley sockets.|S
mn081|it's almost perfect.|S
mn081|they kind of skipped uh layer five uh session management or session layer i think.|S
mn081|that's um normally with if you do a socket programming it's directly the application protocol on layer four uh t.c.p. socket or layer five for u.d.p. socket.|S
mn081|there might also be some research|D
mn081|well.|F
mn081|could you introduce such a session management?|Q
mn081|or|F
mn081|what they do right now is they make it part of the application level protocol.|S
mn081|that's what they do most often.|S
mn081|like with session management for mobile the uh applications such as instant messaging or uh talks and so on uh like zip it's just doing a a reconnect.|S
mn081|if they think that the network is different or different capabilities come into play they simply do a reconnect.|S
mn081|so it's part of the protocol.|S
mn081|that's all what i think about session management.|S
mn081|like part of in proxies or is it embedded in application level protocols.|S
mn082|but it's really higher level.|S
mn082|right?|Q
mn082|it's no more related to a network.|S
mn081|it's|D
mn082|we are leaving the network area.|S
mn082|that's dangerous.|S
mn081|so how do you want to focus on network services.|S
mn082|because if you go to the|D
mn082|if you|D
mn082|for me that's starting with middleware aspects.|S
mn082|you know?|Q
mn081|well|D
mn082|and|D
mn081|so network applications if you look at the name of the group one thing is that um they used to call a a a network that was uh if it was like distributed between two systems connected by a network.|S
mn081|if you look at network from the o.z. layer then it's uh level two or something or maybe level three but everything below three.|S
mn081|so there are i think two two different interpretations of uh network.|S
mn082|no i believe network is if you see it really from from the i.p. protocol suite is then layer one in principle up including layer four.|S
mn082|despite the fact that layer four is only residing normally in the end system and in the gateways.|S
mn081|but are there network applications then?|Q
mn082|yeah.|B
mn081|so the the name is network services and applications.|S
mn081|so what could be an example of a network application if you look at the o.z. stick?|Q
mn082|yeah we have i think some.|S
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|do you see this word application related to a network?|Q
mn082|or do you see this word independently?|Q
mn082|that was never discussed in detail.|S
mn082|network services and applications.|S
mn082|so everything in the world.|S
mn081|okay.|S
mn082|or is the application related to the network?|Q
mn082|for my understanding and as far as we discussed so such a long time uh these applications should.|S
mn082|for instance ecommerce.|S
mn081|okay okay well they will i didn't want to get a discussion now.|S
mn082|and it's really really|D
mn082|yeah|F
mn082|you know?|Q
mn082|that|D
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|no no uh that is a typical application i think.|S
mn082|which is in principle also a little bit related to uh to the network.|S
mn082|but not any application.|S
mn082|and we also have the aspects for security.|S
mn082|miguel you mentioned here authentication and and triple a..|S
mn082|but we do not have any expert anymore.|S
mn082|because hannes was an expert for that.|S
mn082|so the problem for me it still exists that we have in principle here basic building blocks in the proposal from the networking side.|S
mn082|we could have a certain kind of application.|S
mn082|and there's a lot of activities in the outside world.|S
mn082|and i believe there's a lot of contacts.|S
mn082|or there could be a lot of contacts uh with with these people.|S
mn082|especially at uh georgia tech.|S
mn082|i know on next week on tuesday.|S
mn082|tuesday right.|S
mn082|we will go to u.c.b.|S
mn082|there are three guys.|S
mn082|then morgan mentioned one.|S
mn082|i do not know exactly um uh what he is doing.|S
mn082|but he's also interesting in some kind of collaboration.|S
mn082|he's also a professor in the u.c.b.|S
mn082|and uh many universities.|S
mn082|maybe claudia mentioned duisburg.|S
mn082|and uh in principle most of the university have some activities in that area.|S
mn082|we will not take care about these one.|S
mn082|but we can use them as um for field uh field trial access.|S
mn082|and and and maybe some support.|S
mn082|and and whatever kind of thing.|S
mn082|and we focus really on the networking stuff.|S
mn082|and going in more detail in this area.|S
mn082|and the alternative is maybe what uh|D
mn082|currently we have only uh this uh proposal from wilbert to go more in the smaller scope.|S
mn082|figure out some potential from maybe this uh wavelan u.m.t.s. stuff.|S
mn082|and and starting from that.|S
mn082|or are there other suggestions?|Q
mn030|i think we uh have already so much work put into this proposal.|S
mn030|why to switch now?|Q
mn030|so i don't see the reason for that.|S
mn030|maybe the application we suggested is not the best one.|S
mn030|so we have to think about an application which which is um um for mobile users more relevant.|S
mn030|i don't know.|S
mn030|maybe video games.|S
mn030|if you are traveling|D
mn030|uh it's boring to travel.|S
mn030|and then you decide to play a video game with somebody else who's traveling.|S
mn082|yeah you know it's still mentioned in the proposal.|S
mn030|so|F
mn082|and|F
mn082|um|D
mn082|i i'm sure okay that it is the wrong place to get the foundation why we are use this kind of application.|S
mn082|but uh and in in the end of the text in the end of the text of the proposal.|S
mn082|but it is mentioned that it is only an example.|S
mn082|and that we use this application in principle while it is then very very easy to get a certain kind of access to these kind of things.|S
mn082|when you have a video game server and and you want to have mobile access you must at least have one in your consortium or as a partner whatever who provides this service.|S
mn082|and then we we are playing videos in principle if you have a field trial.|S
mn082|and that is i think much more harder than to have a certain kind of certain kind of access to the university.|S
mn082|and uh to this server which is run on the campus of the university.|S
mn030|okay that's right.|S
mn082|and that is the point.|S
mn082|you can have this to figure out all the things.|S
mn082|and the the um|F
mn082|and the the um|F
mn082|um now how to say the requirements of this application using this classroom scenario.|S
mn082|but nevertheless it's not the best for 3x.|S
mn082|and and and and uh|F
mn082|networking stuff.|S
mn082|you are right.|S
mn082|but it does anybody see certain kind of potential here to go on?|Q
mn082|and to start the work maybe in this little bit smaller oh uh scope based on these building blocks.|S
mn082|because multicast you still uh you mentioned that there is no potential.|S
mn082|i think it's described here that the potential if you use it for the mapping to the next generation networks in the wireless access area they are still some potential to map multicast.|S
mn082|because they do not use it.|S
mn082|and to figure out whether they're useful instead of using certain kind of tunneling mechanism and to set up these tunnels|D
mn082|and have the mapping between a p.s.d.n. uh telephone number or whatever kind of number they are using to i.p. addresses and then there's the tunnel i.d.'s|D
mn082|and and all this kind of things i think is very beneficial as well for for telecommunication providers.|S
mn082|as well as for i.s.p.'s.|S
mn082|i i think the potential is still there.|S
mn082|you you neglected that.|S
mn082|but i don't think that you are right in that sense.|S
mn081|well think it works.|S
mn081|but uh|D
mn081|yes the mapping of course between multicasting and the u.m.t.s. or or whatever.|S
mn082|in next generation?|Q
mn082|yeah.|B
mn081|that's or c.d.m.a. or whatever that's uh yeah probably a thing that has to be find out.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn081|i don't know what statuses.|S
mn081|maybe they already did it as part of u.m.t.s.|S
mn081|i'm not sure.|S
mn081|i don't have a clue.|S
mn081|i i only know how it works on copper and like ethernet.|S
mn081|and on p.s.p.p.p. over something.|S
mn081|and how it works like that.|S
mn081|but on the wireless i'm not sure.|S
mn082|now what do you see about the|D
mn082|um um|F
mn082|k.p.n. interests.|S
mn082|because i believe if the argument changes as follows that you are here and that you are very familiar with uh the multicast stuff and k.p.n. is very interesting in u.m.t.s. stuff and this is one potential target network environment we are focusing on but only for the uh i.p. layer technology then why do the mapping of also potential mapping of multicast i think must be of major interest for them.|S
mn082|right?|Q
mn021|one question.|S
mn081|yes but if if it's available|D
mn081|that means|D
mn081|so so if uh if it's already part of the u.m.t.s. standardization then uh it's immediately finished.|S
mn081|like okay you can tell k.p.n. well go to ericsson or nokia and buy it.|S
mn081|and if it's not in there yet well it could be a suggestion.|S
mn081|and then the hardware people will make it part like the etsi or whatever where u. wherever u.m.t.s. is standardized they will well go for it.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn081|of course yeah this this group could do that too.|S
mn081|could be.|S
mn081|but|F
mn021|i have a an important doubt about the i.p. availability over u.m.t.s.|S
mn021|i mean you know that the carriers and some manufacturers have done an important effort in developing this web thing.|S
mn021|and uh i'm not sure what they plan to do with next generation.|S
mn021|i mean are they maintaining are they holding the same web technology?|Q
mn021|or are just they discarding this technology?|Q
mn021|and forgetting about the thing.|S
mn021|i i don't know what will happen.|S
mn021|uh i i don't have a clue.|S
mn021|probably if after searching a little bit on the on the net i can get the answer.|S
mn021|but initially this is something to to to have in mind.|S
mn021|i mean because maybe this u.m.t.s. thing will appear on the market without i.p. as a native protocol.|S
mn021|and if this is the case well thus seamless integration could be strongly affected.|S
mn021|at least uh if you we want to use u.m.t.s.|S
mn021|i'm i'm just uh throwing the question.|S
mn021|uh i mean looking for an answer.|S
mn021|because i don't know if uh some of you have a clue about this.|S
mn021|i don't know what what carriers are planning to do about this.|S
mn081|i'm not really sure.|S
mn081|but i thought i i had the impression that we can throw away our nokia stuff when our web gateways when we even go to g.p.r.s.|S
mn081|so|F
mn081|let alone u.m.t.s.|S
mn082|now wap is ja not only related now to available bandwidth.|S
mn081|that's the impression i get.|S
mn082|that's not the only thing.|S
mn082|it's only the adaptation towards the capabilities of the end device.|S
mn082|right?|Q
mn081|yeah definitely.|S
mn082|so|F
mn082|uh i never was a friend|D
mn081|but but still a it's a it's a fundamental|D
mn082|huh.|D
mn082|yeah.|B
mn081|uh it's a part of a of design like the the|D
mn081|the terminal has a wap stick.|S
mn081|and there's a box that has also a a wap stick.|S
mn082|so yeah.|D
mn081|and they do sometime most cases they do share an i.p. address.|S
mn081|but doesn't uh have to deal with i.p. at all.|S
mn081|it's just a thirty bit number.|S
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn081|that actually is an assigned number.|S
mn081|but it's all only used for identification.|S
mn081|that's the only thing.|S
mn081|it's stored in a wap cookie.|S
mn081|much like h.t.p.|S
mn081|in a cookie and from the wap gateway|D
mn081|then it will be h.t.p. real h.t.p. or something.|S
mn081|so it's it's really a different uh type of connection.|S
mn081|it looks a little bit like uh the the well w.m.l. looks a little bit like h.t.m.l.|S
mn081|but that's all what's uh|D
mn081|it's not i.p. at all.|S
mn082|right.|B
mn081|because there is a gateway you can access with almost the same microbrowser.|S
mn081|the same uh web servers.|S
mn081|if they provide the right content uh spit out the right uh w.m.l. language.|S
mn081|so it's it's really a different network technology i think.|S
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|it's transparent in principle what you can carry.|S
mn082|but|F
mn082|anyway you have the gateway.|S
mn082|it must be uh the uh uh conversion of the media.|S
mn081|yeah.|B
mn081|but|D
mn082|of the contents in principle.|S
mn082|but i don't see that uh|D
mn082|it's too late i believe.|S
mn082|if wap was available in the beginning of g.s.m. then i think it was there would be a good chance that it is well deployed.|S
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn082|but now the first generation of web-browsers are in the and and uh i would say handies.|S
mn082|so that's wrong in the mobile phones.|S
mn082|but the the next generation of networks are still available.|S
mn082|and the uh the bandwidth constraints are no more applicable.|S
mn081|well|F
mn081|right now there is still a lot of wap actually.|S
mn082|and|D
mn081|so that the|D
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn082|yeah but the hype.|S
mn082|but|D
mn082|pffft|D
mn082|uh|F
mn081|well users usage.|S
mn082|i never saw a user using wap.|S
mn082|please raise your hand who is using wap.|S
mn081|my colleagues are.|S
mn082|yeah?|Q
mn081|yeah.|S
mn081|yeah they are using wap.|S
mn082|yeah?|Q
mn082|okay one of six.|S
mn082|so|F
mn030|i don't have a mobile phone.|S
mn081|yeah.|B
mn082|oh.|S
mn035|who is using mobile phones?|Q
mn081|well you don't have a mobile phone in in the u.s.a. here.|S
mn021|no.|S
mn021|no.|S
mn081|so that's maybe the reason.|S
mn021|not me.|S
mn081|and i'm not i doubt that it's not available in germany.|S
mn081|it's would be unbelievable to me.|S
mn082|now do you yeah do you see the chance for wap?|Q
mn082|i don't see it.|S
mn081|it it is.|S
mn081|in in in sweden it is also there.|S
mn081|and in the netherlands it is also available.|S
mn021|huh.|B
mn081|every provider provides|D
mn021|in spain it's available.|S
mn021|but uh you know uh my main complaint has been all the time that it is difficult to me to believe that i can do interesting work with a 4 lines display.|S
mn021|uh maybe check the lottery result or something like this.|S
mn081|oh.|S
mn081|yeah but|D
mn081|oh!|S
mn081|i'm the first one to admit that's a that it is a hype.|S
mn021|but|F
mn081|but and but i'm i just wanted to say it is being used.|S
mn081|but if it makes sense to me and to especially to have wap in in between no.|S
mn081|i'm not a supporter of it.|S
mn021|huh huh-huh.|B
mn081|so they have this optimized protocol to to transmit a few ascii bytes that can refresh the screen with a different animation every well second a few times.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn081|so that's that's true.|S
mn081|i immediately agree.|S
mn081|but the thing was you just asked well will will it be the same will there be wap for u.m.t.s. and so on q.p.r.s.|S
mn021|well|D
mn081|and well i don't have the answer.|S
mn021|i i don't know what will|D
mn081|but i thought it was not.|S
mn081|i'm just it's weird it's weird to stop doing it with g.p.r.s.|S
mn035|yeah.|B
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B
mn035|but usually wap shouldn't is so general that it can be used with u.m.t.s.|S
mn035|so if you still want to use wap with u.m.t.s. you might be able to do it.|S
mn035|but|D
mn081|yes.|S
mn035|that shouldn't be your only way of|D
mn082|there's a you can put the gateway.|S
mn081|if you want to do it in a in a mobile phone want to implement it as a light stack or something.|S
mn082|yeah.|D
mn082|yeah.|D
mn081|yes?|Q
mn082|yep.|S
mn081|sure.|S
mn035|but usually that's not the reason to have u.m.t.s.|S
mn081|no not not if you have a big uh web pad or something.|S
mn035|yep.|S
mn081|then you there there's an i.p. stack in it.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn081|and|F
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn082|so maybe i would like to ask claudia|D
mn081|huh.|B
mn082|you read the proposal in the meantime?|Q
fn083|yeah but the task changed really a lot.|S
mn082|yeah.|S
fn083|so i'd i rather would like to|D
mn082|yes that's right.|S
mn082|and do you have some comments on it?|Q
mn082|from the next this is version zero dot five right yeah.|S
fn083|yeah but i'd rather like to follow the discussion before i gave any comments.|S
fn083|because it's really the first point is it's much more than it was before i left.|S
fn083|so it's like five weeks in between so it's like that whew.|S
fn083|that big now.|S
mn082|that's right.|S
fn083|and it really changed a lot.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
fn083|because the i mean i found the classroom inside.|S
fn083|but the thing where i left the discussion was that we are talking about uh a classroom where you know everybody could look on with any kind of device and follow lectures or do exercise or whatever.|S
fn083|so|F
fn083|now we are talking about something which is much more precise.|S
fn083|and the the range of stuff is maybe more narrow than before.|S
fn083|so i'd rather like to to follow it a bit and then to get more into the ideas.|S
mn082|okay.|S
mn081|can i do another one like|D
mn081|u.m.t.s. or wireless generally are will be more expensive.|S
mn081|and especially u.m.t.s.|S
mn081|if they want to get back the money.|S
mn081|so is it maybe a research topic to focus on the|D
mn081|not really billing of course.|S
mn081|i wouldn't|D
mn081|but at least the different application of protocol based usage.|S
mn081|so you have uh one connection one application uses f.t.p. whatever.|S
mn081|bit voice or some other|D
mn081|that those type of application you may might want to make more out of a megabit per second or something.|S
mn081|could that be something?|Q
mn081|or|D
mn082|also we want to go more in the triple a. area right?|S
mn082|because billing alone|D
mn081|or is|D
mn081|no well it's|D
mn082|or or um billing is related to accounting.|S
mn082|accounting is related to authentification and authorization.|S
mn081|yeah that's true.|S
mn082|so|F
mn082|and then you are still at the triple a. service uh activity.|S
mn081|yeah that's right.|S
mn082|and nobody is has the skills to deal with that.|S
mn082|and then we are leaving our scope anyway.|S
mn081|okay.|S
mn035|my impression on this proposal is that every single block has some research done already.|S
mn035|so multicast this means that there are many things done.|S
mn035|oh what was it?|Q
mn035|maybe i was routing mobility management.|S
mn035|but no one actually put them together.|S
mn082|yeah that's|D
mn035|but so that's the big problem.|S
mn082|that is a|D
mn035|but the problem with this problem might be that it's too big.|S
mn035|to put all these big pieces to|D
fn083|what do you mean by put together?|Q
mn035|so that you really have a complete a complete scenario.|S
mn082|as it what i mean the synergy effect right?|S
mn082|from from|D
mn082|yeah.|B
mn035|you have in one scenario multicast quality of service routing and mobile um networking.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
fn083|uh.|B
fn083|uhhuh.|B
mn035|not just the islands alone.|S
fn083|so why i wasn't|D
fn083|well yeah uh hold myself back a bit with comments is uh because when i left the discussion the discussion was what to to have something like a big umbrella about everybody who was at this point here.|S
fn083|and so the discussion was much broader than it is maybe right now.|S
fn083|and there i had the impression the umbrella was this kind of classroom thing.|S
fn083|right?|Q
fn083|or wrong?|Q
mn082|yeah in principle it is related to the current state.|S
mn082|but the networking stuff is more explained in much more detail.|S
fn083|yeah yeah yeah it is.|S
fn083|of course.|S
mn082|and the work packages are better oder what could be derived for work packages is much better aligned.|S
fn083|yeah.|B
fn083|yeah yeah yeah.|S
fn083|that's that's clear.|S
mn082|but that has not changed yeah?|S
fn083|yeah that's that's clear.|S
fn083|but then i don't get|D
fn083|because when we were discussion discussing this uh stuff weeks ago uh i had the impression that you know everything of these work packages uh fit together under this one big umbrella.|S
fn083|and now it sounds different.|S
fn083|so that's what i don't understand.|S
fn083|uh but it's also because i missed the last four weeks.|S
fn083|so|F
mn082|yeah the problem is if you|D
fn083|it's a a bit hard for me to follow the development what happened in the last four weeks.|S
mn082|yeah okay maybe one sentence one sentence.|S
fn083|why it changed so.|S
mn082|if you're focussing on the argument chain as follows i have an application.|S
mn082|this application has certain kind of requirements.|S
mn082|these requirements are maybe multicast and and and quality of service and mobility.|S
mn082|access and then mobility management.|S
mn082|and that is it.|S
mn082|i want to focus on it.|S
mn082|then you have in mind that or you must have in mind that all other applications and all other networking stuff is not affected by this.|S
mn082|that you can use it with every application.|S
mn082|and if you introduce some new mechanism in the network that is not related only to interactive multimedia applications like the classroom it must be fit end to end.|S
mn082|and if you assume something like we discussed it very hard with with multicast that you assume that multicast will be available at certain portions of the network or if you if you want to have it end to end this mechanism must be applied really for all throughout of the internet.|S
mn082|otherwise it makes no sense.|S
mn082|and we come to the conclusion okay uh multicast we must deal with both approaches.|S
mn082|that you have uh application layer multicast.|S
mn082|as well as maybe some other multicast and maybe really multicast.|D
mn082|and then the point is how to select these mechanism if you want to have not a certain kind of access to the server elsewhere in the network you want to use any application.|S
fn083|so if i understand i it right what has changed is before we were focussing on|D
mn082|yeah?|Q
mn082|and|D
fn083|so because what's difficult for me is what is meant by application.|S
fn083|so because i have sometimes the impression that everybody is defining application in different way.|S
fn083|so what exactly is mean by application?|Q
mn082|the application for instance here that uh the interactive classroom.|S
mn082|but elsewhere any application in in in any kind of video audio.|S
fn083|yeah.|S
fn083|oh okay.|S
fn083|so what has changed|D
mn082|or whatever kind of game server.|S
mn082|what kind of interactive multimedia especially uh downstreaming applications maybe uh video on demand then uh whatever kind of application you can consider.|S
fn083|so what has changed is that we're not only focussing on this intelligent classroom but on everything.|S
mn082|not on everything.|S
mn082|that's not true.|S
mn082|but we|D
mn082|that's why we say here that we have a certain kind of uh possibility to change in the access networks.|S
fn083|uhhuh.|B
mn082|that means the wireless networks.|S
mn082|because that provides in principle the mobility.|S
mn082|and these|D
mn082|and you see that there's a trend to provide i.p. functionality more and more in these kind of networks.|S
mn082|but the problem is that you could not focus on this kind of um technology only for the access network.|S
mn082|you have to have in mind always the end to end scope.|S
mn082|and if you see for instance we have routing algorithm but different protocols and whatever kinds of things|D
mn082|especially also for multicast.|S
mn082|different things really for different providers.|S
mn082|and uh and it's uh very easy to change it maybe in the access network for novel things.|S
mn082|for instance that's one provider domain.|S
mn082|and you can say well why not use active routing in that provider domain.|S
mn082|so it means that packet are delivering information.|S
mn082|and you do not have the separation of routing and and and forwarding process.|S
mn082|it's impossible to deal with that in the whole internet.|S
mn082|because security reasons and whatever kinds of things make it impossible.|S
mn082|so how to combine these uh potential um extensions in the um access networks and|D
mn082|without losing the end to end scope in the internet.|S
mn082|then you can have certain novel features.|S
mn082|give the providers like k.p.n. or whatever the the potential in principle to to uh see the building blocks for the future networks.|S
mn082|because there's a three third generation like u.m.t.s.a. fourth generation more i.p. related.|S
mn082|there will be a fifth generation i'm sure.|S
mn082|and then you derive the certain kind of building blocks for this network.|S
mn082|if you ever really full i uh uh full i.p. end to end.|S
mn082|but nevertheless you can only not only focus on okay i provide this mechanism.|S
mn082|because you are accessing a certain kind of server node in the internet using any application.|S
mn082|and then this mechanism must fit it there.|S
mn082|but nevertheless uh internet backbone is in the meantime based on its success.|S
mn082|impossible to change.|S
mn082|you see the difficulties with i.p. version six.|S
mn082|uh uh you see the difficulties with multicast.|S
mn082|they are discussed since you know ten years or whatever.|S
mn082|the specification are rather stable and and available.|S
mn082|but we have only islands in that.|S
mn082|we cannot assume that everything is end to end available.|S
mn082|and so you have to to have to have in mind that certain kinds of mechanisms are maybe at a certain stage end to end available.|S
mn082|maybe we have a lucky that the islands are connected to each other.|S
mn082|or the same applies for m.p.l.s. for instance.|S
mn082|maybe they are only portions available.|S
mn082|how to deal with that when the islands are not available?|Q
mn082|and maybe nothing is available.|S
mn082|but you have to select it.|S
mn082|because i have a mobile phone a mobile node or whatever kind of device.|S
mn082|and i want to contact a certain kind of content in the internet.|S
mn082|so is it possible to have certain kind of normal features in the access network without losing the end to end scope of with these difficulties we are dealing with.|S
mn082|i always say that the success of internet make it unflexible.|S
mn082|it's impossible to change something very easy.|S
mn082|it's easy maybe more on the access network as in the internet backbone.|S
mn082|so that is uh overall picture that we have in mind with these things.|S
mn082|and we can not|D
mn082|we we are six people.|S
mn082|or seven or whatever.|S
mn082|if hannes come.|S
mn082|we are not able to solve the problems uh in in uh in the few years or whatever.|S
mn082|what the whole internet community has um done in in since uh since a decade.|S
mn082|but we can pick up some some um potential and and and to start with something.|S
mn082|and that's my missing point.|S
mn082|that we have here in principle really the description of this problem i mentioned.|S
mn082|and focus really on the reasonable size of the project.|S
mn082|maybe in the first stage for the n.s.a. core itself.|S
mn082|and maybe possible extension from for instance if k.p.n. say yes that's great.|S
mn082|that's the right direction.|S
mn082|we will support that.|S
mn082|and if siemens say okay great we will support it.|S
mn082|and and what it|D
mn082|huh university of berlin or something.|S
mn082|and maybe university of mannheim or duisburg.|S
mn082|or in spain oder whatever.|S
mn082|so if we have all the similar project then you have only to take care about that's a little bit aligned.|S
mn082|that there's some transparency concerning the results.|S
mn082|and and the activities are literally going in the in the same um pace.|S
mn082|so that's the basic idea.|S
mn082|but really it's to to figure out certain kind of smaller activities where we can start it.|S
mn082|that's the point.|S
mn082|and if we get some funding back|D
mn082|and we have certain uh potential partners in the boat|D
mn082|okay we can go to a broader scope of this whole thing yeah.|S
mn021|let me let me propose a a a a reasoning way.|S
mn021|uh let's assume that we are successful with this proposal.|S
mn021|so we get the funding to do whatever what we want to do.|S
mn021|so my question is what we want to do is|D
mn021|let's assume that we have the funding.|S
mn021|what will be our first and or or and second steps?|Q
mn021|uh what kind of things uh we uh we will buy?|Q
mn021|what kind of things we will uh program or we will deploy?|Q
mn021|because answering this these questions we can know much better what the application we want.|S
mn021|so let's assume|D
mn082|yeah but the problem is that funding is the second step.|S
mn081|huh.|B
mn081|well i'm not sure.|S
mn081|i i i think i agree with him.|S
mn081|but uh right now we're looking at a you want to do a big thing instead of a great thing.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn081|so if you assume that it should connect uh really good to siemens and to uh k.p.n. and to the then it starts to get big we should all go to the in the same direction.|S
mn081|if you already assume well okay they paid money and now you think okay what what great thing you want to do then it gives you more freedom to think about this great thing you want to do.|S
mn082|yeah but we have no uh current no public funding.|S
mn081|no.|S
mn082|okay everybody's paid here.|S
mn021|yeah.|B
mn035|yeah but but|D
mn081|but you but you don't get one if you if you try to to align k.p.n. with siemens for instance.|S
fn083|yeah.|B
mn035|yeah.|B
mn035|but|D
mn082|yeah.|B
mn082|yeah.|B
mn035|but for theoretical or for historical reasons a really good question if we would have the money what would we do with that.|S
mn081|uh|D
mn035|so if we don't know what we would like to do with the money we probably wouldn't get any money to do what we don't know.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn082|that's right.|S
mn021|absolutely.|S
mn082|that's right.|S
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|yeah.|S
mn035|so that's why i think yeah it's a good question.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn082|now that's the point why i am focussing on more on the|D
mn035|yep.|B
mn082|yeah|F
mn082|i want to have really the activities.|S
mn082|you know what is really the outcome?|S
mn082|what is really the problem we are going to solve?|Q
mn082|these are my questions.|S
mn082|and if we have identified this block then it is possible to raise some money.|S
mn082|yeah.|S
mn035|that's just the same question just other way around.|S
mn021|let let me put an example.|S
mn021|you know i some days ago i bought like some of you this kind of things.|S
mn021|this is a p.d.a.|S
mn021|uh three com uh palm pilot compatible.|S
mn035|modernistic stuff.|S
mn021|nothing nothing that great.|S
mn035|completely useless.|S
mn021|but it has some some possibility of being expanded.|S
mn021|but the point is uh the only in here the only thing wireless thing i can put on on this is just uh this omnisky modem.|S
mn021|which is uh i think it is a subscription based uh thing.|S
mn021|you have to pay every every month.|S
mn021|and uh of course i cannot imagine that uh tomorrow i'll be able to buy a different thing with four different networks.|S
mn021|four different providers on it.|S
mn021|maybe i'm wrong.|S
mn021|but|D
mn021|if i have the funding i say okay well i can buy this or even i can buy a mobile computer.|S
mn021|a notebook.|S
mn021|okay?|Q
mn021|a lot more expensive.|S
mn021|but that's okay.|S
mn021|i have the funding.|S
mn021|then i can add a couple of cards at most.|S
mn021|because huh the majority of the of the notebooks only have two p.c. cards uh type two slots.|S
mn021|so|F
mn021|in in the better case maybe i'm only able to add two different networks to this thing.|S
mn021|so uh|F
mn021|the difficulty i see is that uh if we are if you want to think in in two three four different technologies um maybe we are uh too advanced too um let's say uh too in advance for the current technology.|S
mn021|which is not bad.|S
mn021|but uh i'm just saying that it will be able it will|D
mn021|sorry.|S
mn021|it will be difficult for us to develop a a reasonable test bed with the available technology.|S
mn021|if somebody tell us okay now here you have the thing and just put these four networks you want on the thing how can i do it now?|Q
mn021|so huh|F
mn021|i'm still trying to you know to get used to the uh all the ideas.|S
mn021|and to see that all the things are really connecting.|S
mn021|because this the uh most difficult thing i see to to to get this alignment to this connection point among the different things we are trying to align.|S
mn021|so that's why i was proposing this this question.|S
mn021|let's assume we have the funding.|S
mn021|now let's proceed.|S
mn021|what what kind of things we can buy we can put together we can program?|Q
mn021|because oh at the end uh somebody will uh be asking us okay did you do your homework.|S
mn021|did you do what you|D
mn021|so|F
mn082|it's clear.|S
mn082|now from my point of view in the beginning one more time if i see the four building blocks and uh i could speak only for my skills i believe to derive a certain kind of q.s. reservation in advance scheme much more uh general as it is done for for u.s.a.i.a.|S
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn082|but mapped then really to desired network subnet layer technologies.|S
mn021|but for different networks?|Q
mn082|yes.|S
mn021|the point is for|D
mn082|for|D
mn082|no for u.m.t.s.|S
mn082|but first of all a generic system.|S
mn082|but because you can have several mechanism.|S
mn082|really using certain kind of of um um quantitative description.|S
mn082|you can have more of a qualitative description.|S
mn082|you can have taken into account moving patterns.|S
mn082|and and and whatever kind of things.|S
mn082|but there are a lot of lot of ways to have certain kind of q.s. reservation in advance.|S
mn082|and i see it as definitely is necessary to have this one.|S
mn082|if i want be mobile and i want to have not a interruption of my in my application qualities of service.|S
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B
mn082|so|F
mn082|um|F
mn082|but then to go for instance to u.m.t.s. and figure out what is available within u.m.t.s.|S
mn082|and if i really have an i.p. application where i need this kind of of quality of service and having in mind that certain kind of q.s. will be available in the rest of the internet|D
mn082|so how can i map these things uh to the u.m.t.s. stuff?|Q
mn082|and what is the trend towards u.m.t.s. to the first generation?|Q
mn082|and how it is possible to map this one to this technology?|Q
mn082|and if you have the building blocks identified what is really necessary for q.s. uh q.s. in advance for for mobile systems then you have in principle the ideas for the following generation what you could improve.|S
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn082|because then you are maybe no more related to this kind of thing.|S
mn082|i believe the same applies for multicast.|S
mn082|and i believe the same applies for routing.|S
mn082|so in principle in the beginning there would be a certain kind of uh paperwork anyway.|S
mn082|some theoretical examination of these problems.|S
mn021|i think so.|S
mn082|and then some prototypes must be derived from that.|S
mn082|and then maybe we will start here with a certain kind of uh testbed equipment we still have here.|S
mn082|we have four uh p.c.'s available.|S
mn082|maybe we have to extend it then.|S
mn082|and figure out some real scenarios.|S
mn082|and maybe then pfff.|S
mn021|oh yeah.|S
mn082|because uh despite the|D
mn082|uh uh hopefully then we have with the money also not uh only for the room.|S
mn082|that would be great.|S
mn082|but there are also some sponsors then then then we add a certain kind of field trial.|S
mn082|but i think that's pfff that's years you know.|S
mn021|a long way yeah.|S
mn082|that's years.|S
mn021|that's right.|S
mn082|but in the beginning we must have a certain kind of theoretical framework with the relevant technology.|S
mn082|real technology.|S
mn082|maybe you can start with g.p.s. or or u.m.t.s. or whatever.|S
mn082|because these technology will definitely available in europe.|S
mn082|there's some money spent on it.|S
mn082|so that it will be in a certain kind of flavor.|S
mn082|it will be available.|S
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B
mn082|and it will be also available in the u.s.a.|S
mn082|because there is a big uh harmonization effort.|S
mn082|despite the fact they are not aligned to each other anyway.|S
mn082|but they will have also certain kind of third generation and fourth generation networks.|S
mn082|so|F
mn082|and after this theoretical framework if this one is aligned okay you have some specification.|S
mn082|and you set up some linux or free b.s.d. or whatever kind of prototype.|S
mn082|so that is what i have in mind with that.|S
mn082|and then okay and then you will see.|S
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn082|the problem is which i see is that it could be fruitful to standardization.|S
mn082|that it could be fruitful to some extent to telecommunication providers.|S
mn082|but there's not a real product like you say.|S
mn082|there's not the selling idea behind it.|S
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B
mn082|yeah?|Q
mn082|if you go with something what what wilbert mentioned okay let's have this one here we have a new p.c.m.c.i.a. card and and extend something and the end system or what you mentioned here was the seamless four technologies inter working in the end then you have an an a device which you can sell.|S
mn082|if you go for a networking pfff um uh improvements in principle and and understanding next generation building blocks uh there's no product.|S
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn082|but it is a long term it's long term i think uh work you can do.|S
mn082|and it's more related i believe to the skills.|S
mn082|to what is available.|S
mn082|and and currently as i see what uh will be available within the n.s.a. group.|S
mn021|okay.|S
mn082|and uh the point is if we focus on on this networking small more networking stuff and them some application guys came into the boat and they focus on their application stuff whatever this means it might be we have then the active classroom.|S
mn082|but it could be another one.|S
mn082|that is not representative.|S
fn083|yeah but there's something needed to sell it.|S
mn082|it's only|D
mn082|huh?|Q
fn083|and i think|D
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|then then is something available.|S
mn082|but i don't know.|S
mn082|you know i'm not an application expert.|S
mn082|i|D
mn082|we have some content.|S
mn082|we will then discuss it on next tuesday as i mentioned.|S
mn021|bless you.|S
fn083|bless you.|S
mn082|uh anyway but uh that were is my answer to the question if some money is available.|S
mn082|the good thing is that the money is available.|S
mn082|because everybody is paid here.|S
mn082|so that is money that the the smallest portion of money which is available.|S
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B
mn082|but first of all wilbert need more definitely.|S
mn082|because maybe then k.p.n. is uh no more interesting to go on with this work.|S
mn082|or we can convince with these kind of things which we have in mind.|S
mn082|uh companies like k.p.n.|S
mn082|so|F
mn082|and if we have other suggestions and uh have this as a long term|D
mn082|n.s.a. core group activity.|S
mn082|and this theoretical framework whether it is finished in half a year or one year doesn't matter in principle.|S
mn082|because the road map for the the next generation networks is is uh is for many years.|S
mn082|and before u.m.t.s. will be deployed very well i believe uh it will be common uh two thousand four or something like that.|S
mn082|so|F
mn082|and and have an intermediate project which is related in this direction something like the seamless handover for two technologies or whatever.|S
mn082|this is a smaller portion in the more generic framework i would like to say from this proposal.|S
mn082|why not go in this way?|Q
mn021|okay.|S
mn082|i i don't know.|S
mn082|but uh that's the point uh we are sitting here together.|S
mn021|yeah.|S
mn021|but|D
mn082|but for for dietmar i think uh uh he mentioned it to me it's very clear that he will go on with a portion of time with this u.s.a.i.a. stuff.|S
mn030|that's right.|S
mn030|it depends on my|D
mn082|in the matical sense.|S
mn082|because that means for you in a certain kind a certain extent you are decoupled from networking stuff.|S
mn082|because your focusing on the mathematical thing of whether it's a network or other thing.|S
mn030|well i'm|D
mn082|it doesn't matter.|S
mn030|i'm focused on performance evaluation.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn082|yeah.|B
mn030|and um especially of communication networks.|S
mn030|and|F
mn082|yeah.|B
mn030|i never uh um dealed with um mobile communications.|S
mn030|so why not?|Q
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|so|F
mn030|so that's uh to open my mind.|S
mn082|there is it still ongoing activity with uh maybe a portion of time at the university of berlin berlin.|S
mn082|and independently whether i will leave the uh uh i.c.s.i. in in the mid of december or not i will still focus on on on these q.s. in advance schemes.|S
mn082|uh also within siemens.|S
mn082|and also with some project there.|S
mn082|and i believe your routing stuff is also available.|S
mn021|huh huh.|B
mn082|uh|F
mn082|and when you when you will go back to spain right?|S
mn021|yeah.|S
mn021|yeah sure.|S
mn082|yeah so and and that's why in principle the skills will be always available i guess.|S
mn021|yeah.|B
mn021|and and|D
mn082|if there is a certain type of project in the home countries and then the uh institutions and|D
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn021|not only this.|S
mn021|we can even use this platform to to get some european projects in the future.|S
mn021|because you know sometimes uh it's a good thing.|S
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|maybe.|S
mn082|currently no money is available you know.|S
mn021|yeah but uh this will i think this will improve over time i'm sure.|S
mn021|so uh|F
mn021|probably.|S
mn021|you know this kind of joint work of different countries companies universities this is usually the best uh the best place to to put a project on.|S
mn021|because it is involving different partners from different points of of europe.|S
mn082|now i will not prevent anybody from getting some cake.|S
mn082|and we are sitting here together.|S
mn082|it's uh very uh very slow in principle.|S
mn082|but my last question is for wilbert.|S
mn082|wilbert you i i think you got the basic idea.|S
mn082|because it was mostly discussed with you here from this current available scrap project proposal.|S
mn082|don't you think that k.p.n. could be convinced to go on this way what i mentioned before?|Q
mn082|there's no way.|S
mn081|no.|S
mn082|they needed definitely in principle some kind of service or device or product or whatever.|S
mn081|yeah.|S
mn081|that's right now the the status.|S
mn081|yes.|S
mn082|can we both have together maybe i think it's a little bit more easier a discussion on thursday?|Q
mn081|i'm out for one a week and a half.|S
mn081|so on wednesday thursday friday i have a workshop at stanford.|S
mn082|okay.|S
mn081|and next week i have a week on holiday.|S
mn082|okay.|S
mn082|maybe that's enough time for you to consider a little bit more in this direction.|S
mn081|could be.|S
mn082|and then we could have uh discussion.|S
mn082|and maybe this one is an overall work in principle where everybody could hook in and and get certain kind of small portions to solve it.|S
mn081|yeah.|B
mn081|so so the only solution would for for k.p.n. would be that there is a a project in this area.|S
mn082|and|D
mn081|so that makes sense to do in this this i mean the bay area.|S
mn021|huh huh.|B
mn081|with a group of uh a few people.|S
mn081|like four or something.|S
mn081|and that connects to this project.|S
mn081|so one somebody or two some bodies can be found uh founded or get money to join this project.|S
mn081|but that the other four should build a service on top of it that has a clear business focus.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn081|it means uh a a u.m.t.s. service basically.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn082|can you consider also in the meantime some potential u.m.t.s. services besides this one?|Q
mn081|yeah.|S
mn081|yeah but you see the the they ask something pretty strange.|S
mn082|and|D
mn081|they they want something pretty strange from me that i think of a service.|S
mn081|a network service.|S
mn081|there are sixty million billion people in the in the world that think of services all day.|S
mn081|and try to make a lot of money with it in the form of start-ups or whatever.|S
mn081|and just think of a service like that if i could do this.|S
mn082|no but uh fff maybe based on this one and you see the networking stuff.|S
mn082|that it is a little bit more evolved and than in the the core network technology in the access network i would like to say.|S
mn081|uhhuh.|B
mn082|and this is aligned then as much as possible to the internet.|S
mn082|that's the basic idea.|S
mn082|that you can have a certain kind of service which make use of these novel things.|S
mn081|uhhuh.|B
mn082|because normally i i believe the the the people are either on the application layer.|S
mn081|i you know|D
mn082|that means higher than layer four.|S
mn082|or they are on layer one to up to layer four.|S
mn082|and the service people are considering|D
mn082|okay u.m.t.s.|S
mn082|you have some location information.|S
mn082|and maybe you are have the infrastructure in the car.|S
mn082|so if i provide a certain kind of service independently what the network is offering you know.|S
mn082|because they do not consider it very well.|S
mn082|they know there is a certain kind of location information.|S
mn082|and you have a g.p.s.|S
mn082|and they know okay it's based on satellite.|S
mn082|and there's u.m.t.s. that is based on base station.|S
mn082|there's all that they consider.|S
mn082|and then assume okay i can do that.|S
mn082|and the networking guy said okay it would be great to have multicast and all these kind of things in the network.|S
mn082|but do not consider really what a sense of benefit uh for applications.|S
mn082|there were new old application make use of it.|S
mn082|and how can new application arise.|S
mn082|which we haven't considered up to now based on this new network function l.a.t. enrich enriched network function l.a.t.|S
mn082|so i think it's worth to to consider something in that way.|S
mn081|well until now i have been trying to think about it.|S
mn081|but uh to me|D
mn081|what i have every every time i encountered it it is all this is all pretty close by.|S
mn081|like the industry is already behind this.|S
mn082|yeah what is our|D
mn081|so they they want to make this available pretty soon.|S
mn081|so i'm just trying to think uh more ahead like uh use the wireless device as a only as a signalling thing or something.|S
mn081|so so whenever you come in with your uh g.s.m. phone and there is a p.c. available like everything will be directed to the the bigger device or something.|S
mn081|so more services like that.|S
mn081|i think they are working pretty hard to get i.p. available very good and efficiently from uh two mobile devices or wireless devices.|S
mn082|not currently there is a technology split.|S
mn081|a thing|D
mn082|of course you have i.p. in the mobile device.|S
mn082|but if you see the strange protocols text.|S
mn082|there's i.p. over i.p. and tunnels and and whatever.|S
mn082|so but it's uh looks very strange to me.|S
mn082|because you have different numbering screens concerning you have a phone number.|S
mn082|you have to map it to i.p. addresses.|S
mn082|and and so on.|S
mn082|but for me you have not the end to end parts of for for i.p. functionality.|S
mn082|we are far away from that.|S
mn082|and if you take a really look to the g.p.r.s. protocols texts and i believe also they apply for u.m.t.s. but i'm not|D
mn082|uh very familiar with that.|S
mn082|and the next generations access network is will come soon.|S
mn082|you see it's every three years or four years they will have a new generation.|S
mn081|and there's a we|D
mn082|but anyway you|D
mn081|our group might want to focus on the uh i.p. over ether no nets.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn082|yeah.|B
mn081|or something like|D
mn081|or over ether.|S
mn082|why?|Q
mn082|what kind what kind i.p. over what do you call it?|Q
mn081|no nets.|S
mn082|no net?|Q
mn081|yeah.|S
mn082|that would be great.|S
mn081|over|D
mn081|like only over ether.|S
mn081|carefully integrated for net.|S
mn081|but there is no net.|S
mn081|if you want to do make like also for wireless devices end to end i.p. available that could be a vision.|S
mn081|like|F
mn082|can you repeat it?|Q
mn081|well so he he says well i.p. to i.p. or end to end i.p. is far well it's far away.|S
mn081|um|F
mn081|so you what you might want to do is well get u.m.t.s. out there.|S
mn081|and just do uh i.p.'s playing over radio.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn082|something like that is my final vision.|S
mn081|like like s.d.h.i.p. over fiber or w.d.w.d.m.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn081|this gets rid of the s.d.h.|S
mn081|or well start with get rid of the a.t.m. first.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn082|a.t.m. stuff.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn082|yeah.|B
mn081|and then get rid of s.d.h.|S
mn082|there's the problem is is you see that the providers uh have always there broken view for for the management.|S
mn082|if you have different kind of protocols texts and network management system and the billing system and all these kinds of things which is besides the networking stuff in principle but you still need it is uh not aligned.|S
mn081|yeah.|B
mn082|we have it for different islands.|S
mn021|uhhuh huh.|D
mn082|and and|F
mn082|well that's my final vision you know.|S
mn082|if you have really then i.p. networks at a certain generation where you have really the physical media and where necessary uh additional maclear protocols.|S
mn082|and then you have really always end to end.|S
mn082|it makes you things much more simple much more easier.|S
mn021|uh|F
mn082|uh but is far far away you know.|S
mn021|unless unless we speak about quality of service.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn082|yeah.|B
mn082|yeah.|B
mn021|which is not uh embedded on on i.p. services.|S
mn082|yeah but you have the extension for the uh quality of service mechanism.|S
mn021|yeah but|D
mn082|which you have to map then to the underlying technology.|S
mn021|yeah but for example nobody's really using r.s.v.p.|S
mn082|and|F
mn082|yeah but maybe in the lan interface it makes.|S
mn082|since to use it|D
mn081|uh you guys do that discussion later on please.|S
mn082|and and but|D
mn082|yeah.|S
mn081|uh?|Q
mn082|but i think we we will miss the cake.|S
mn021|okay sorry sorry.|S
mn081|r.s.v.p.|S
mn082|and i think we should stop now but please everybody|D
mn082|short|D
mn082|uh|D
mn082|go on with considerations and potential.|S
mn082|and and uh|F
mn082|um we didn't make much progress today in the meeting.|S
mn082|but anyway this kind of activity lives from all from the input of all.|S
mn082|and so i really|D
mn082|if somebody has an idea send an email.|S
mn082|and then i would like to enforce everybody|D
mn082|not that i'm doing everything.|S
mn082|i could not i didn't have the time in the past.|S
mn082|and i will not have it in the future.|S
mn082|and maybe i will stay here only four weeks or five weeks.|S
mn082|so it would be really not the best thing if the activity is dead when i am leaving.|S
mn082|and if i stay longer of course we can go on.|S
mn082|but nevertheless i rely heavily uh also from the contributions of everybody.|S
mn082|and it's in their own interest.|S
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B
mn021|that's right.|S
mn082|so if there is certain kind of idea or questions or whatever we are only a small group of people.|S
mn082|we can easily join on a white board and and start a discussion.|S
mn021|well if klaus|D
mn082|it must not be on every tuesday you know.|S
mn021|okay.|S
mn082|at a certain time.|S
mn082|and i try to motivate the people.|S
mn082|that it's free.|S
mn082|that's a starting.|S
mn082|that's a ramp.|S
mn082|and we can go in different directions.|S
mn082|and if you have a real focus on the certain novel thing for the services or u.m.t.s. or whatever great.|S
mn082|if not the long term and then these things must be nevertheless must be defined in much more detail.|S
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|okay?|Q
mn082|so thanks.|S
mn021|okay.|B
mn081|okay.|S
mn082|please do not um what adam mentioned to.|S
mn030|not to switch off.|S
mn082|uh switch off.|S
mn081|don't switch it off.|S
