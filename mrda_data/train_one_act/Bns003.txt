mn082|okay.|F
mn082|welcome to our next meeting.|S
mn082|um i have couple of points we should discussed.|S
mn082|one is related to the proposal.|S
mn082|michael please can you close the door?|Q
mn035|yep.|S
mn082|thank you.|S
mn082|and um|F
mn082|furthermore as most of you know i will leave in tenth of december.|S
mn082|i think we should discuss how we proceed in the meantime.|S
mn082|because i get i would like to say different signals from siemens.|S
mn082|i believe in the meantime it's a higher probability that i will return.|S
mn082|but based on the uh procedure to get a j. one visa and the i.p. six six it will be i would like to say earliest stage will be end of january.|S
mn082|so that means we have to get over six weeks.|S
mn082|and|F
mn082|then furthermore i would like to know the status of everybody.|S
mn082|i know for sure okay um miguel you will have your plans for this uh ongoing process uh concerning your work.|S
mn082|okay from you it's definitely clear in principle.|S
mn082|okay for michael what are your current plans?|Q
mn082|and dietmar maybe you then also.|S
mn082|what we have discussed in principle concerning the ongoing process with u. u.s.a.i.a. and also this uh your current work.|S
mn082|and from my point it seems to be clear that i will go back.|S
mn082|definitely at tenth of december.|S
mn082|and as i mentioned before probably will be more than fifty percent i would like to say that i will be come back to get the freedom to launch here the project in the sense in whatever kind of form and get in principle paid by another project within siemens.|S
mn082|so the point is how long i will stay.|S
mn082|i believe a couple of months definitely.|S
mn082|and based on the success i think that's always an ongoing process to go back to uh to germany for a couple of weeks.|S
mn082|and then come here and and go on with with this work.|S
mn082|and|F
mn082|so that is my current opinion concerning how siemens deal with with my uh ongoing effort.|S
mn082|and furthermore i would like to first of all thanks to uh dietmar.|S
mn082|because he started to use a testbed.|S
mn030|oh.|S
mn082|uh|F
mn082|in principle in his spare time.|S
mn082|yeah.|S
mn030|yeah.|B
mn082|uh i will|D
mn082|so so the first uh uh box this morning.|S
mn082|i will set up definitely in my spare time in the evenings and the weekends the second box.|S
mn082|and i'm looking for two other volunteers who are setting the third and the fourth box.|S
mn021|but what are the box?|Q
mn082|a box is a p.c.|S
mn030|p.c.'s.|S
mn030|p.c.'s.|S
mn021|but what|D
mn082|equipped with with we should equipped it with with linux.|S
mn082|or maybe too with free b.s.d.|S
mn030|well the first|D
mn082|i doubt i don't know.|S
mn030|stop.|S
mn082|and we'll|D
mn030|the first thing the most uh complicated is to fit them with the removal removable um hard disk.|S
mn082|and now we have an expert.|S
mn030|but it's|D
mn030|yeah.|S
mn030|so the first computer i had to|D
mn030|um|F
mn030|the|F
mn030|oh.|S
mn030|what's the right word?|Q
mn030|i had to put everything out.|S
mn030|to to put the removable hard disk in.|S
mn082|yeah to|D
mn082|so that you can pull uh the plug in the removable hard disk to the i.d. bus.|S
mn030|and and it's|D
mn021|okay.|B
mn030|yeah it's|D
mn082|and and okay maybe it's a little bit|D
mn030|but but it's not not um very uh difficult or something like that.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn030|so you just have to|D
mn082|and|F
mn082|why you are laughing?|Q
mn082|i|D
mn082|i don't know.|S
mn082|i i i didn't see him.|S
mn082|so i don't know what he did.|S
mn082|i know in the meantime it's running.|S
mn030|uh!|S
mn082|and i will definitely set up the next one.|S
mn030|so wilbert will set up the second computer.|S
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|though my idea maybe you uh can equip it with|D
mn082|i don't know what your time whether the time constraint allows you to set up one with with free b.s.d. for instance.|S
mn021|you know i i can i can build uh any computer uh you installing whatever it's needed.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn082|okay.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn021|i mean i will enjoy doing it.|S
mn082|do you find the time?|Q
mn021|so|F
mn021|that's okay for me.|S
mn081|huh.|B
mn082|maybe also to uh support your|D
mn081|no promises.|S
mn082|no promises?|Q
mn081|no.|S
mn082|and even maybe to to uh put your i.g.m.p. stuff on it.|S
mn082|uh|F
mn081|no promises.|S
mn082|no promises.|S
mn081|no.|S
mn082|uh he's very hard to sell.|S
mn030|so it's about one hour to put this uh hard disk in.|S
mn030|and a further hour to uh well two or three hours to install the operating systems.|S
mn082|nee because then the network is still running then.|S
mn082|could we wait until the network is running?|Q
mn082|because currently it's not possible uh based on certain fire wall constraints.|S
mn030|yeah.|S
mn030|at the moment.|S
mn082|i believe david is uh currently working on that to set up the fire wall.|S
mn082|and he's not an expert for that.|S
mn082|and when i get the signal i will ask one more time.|S
mn082|nah but nevertheless thanks to dietmar that he.|S
mn081|did the networks have internet connectivity?|Q
mn082|yes.|S
mn082|we have uh for for secure socket.|S
mn082|and uh for web access the fire wall is open.|S
mn082|that's all.|S
mn082|and but currently it's not working right?|S
mn030|right.|S
mn030|um on friday when i installed um uh linux the first time i got access to the local network here um but not to any machines outside of uh i.c.s.i.|S
mn030|and till monday there's no access at all to any machines.|S
mn030|also not to inside machines.|S
mn082|but then|D
mn082|uh|F
mn030|so i think it's related to the work um they've done on sunday here.|S
mn030|and i sent|D
mn081|but normally you should have access to all the internet to outside.|S
mn082|yes.|S
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|you have internet outside access.|S
mn081|full.|S
mn082|but no telnet and not r. login or whatever kind of things you know.|S
mn081|a restricted in.|S
mn081|not.|S
mn081|huh?|Q
mn081|not a no f.t.p.|S
mn082|yeah f.t.p. yes.|S
mn082|but no telnet.|S
mn081|huh.|S
mn082|uh because you can|D
mn082|the the the point is that we will use it as it is uh described several times that we will use it as a local network in principle.|S
mn082|but it doesn't make sense to use certain kinds of uh media transportation to put some stuff you need from your p.c. or your l.s. to this uh uh uh to this testbed.|S
mn082|you know.|F
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn082|so|F
mn082|you download it if that must be possible from the network.|S
mn082|but normally it should be used as um uh for demonstrations or to figure out if you have a scenario where you have to use more than uh one box which you have on your desktop.|S
mn082|because that is the primary uh uh reason for this testbed.|S
mn082|so definitely you have to have web access to download the necessary files.|S
mn021|uhhuh huh.|D
mn082|so and then furthermore one more thanks to claudia.|S
mn082|he did a lot of work.|S
fn083|right.|B
mn082|and i could only pass her some advices and some discussions with her concerning the web pages.|S
fn083|uh the messages.|S
fn083|oh.|S
mn082|and now we are in principle in the state we have to do it with a project area.|S
mn082|but they're also some contributions from you guys requested.|S
mn082|um|F
mn082|and the alumni page in principle we have to|D
mn082|you know but it's primarily my job i believe uh to set up so that it is uh adjusted really to the people who are worth to be alumnis.|S
mn082|alumnis.|S
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|is it alumni alumni?|Q
mn082|i'm|D
fn083|alumni.|S
mn082|alumni.|S
mn082|i'm not sure how to pronounce this word.|S
mn035|aber das wird jetzt geaendert.|S
mn082|huh?|Q
mn035|das wird geaendert.|S
mn082|and um|F
mn082|but um|F
mn082|i think everybody should take a look to the web pages and inform claudia if something uh has to be improved or if there's some comments.|S
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn082|or|F
mn082|uh|F
mn082|he's laughing all the time.|S
mn082|why?|Q
mn082|uh because it is you know that's very important.|S
mn082|maybe not for us.|S
mn082|but maybe for our successors.|S
mn082|and maybe somebody will come back once a day or send some students or some colleagues or whatever.|S
mn082|so my point of view i will i will documented everything when i will leave here in the sense that potential successor as a group leader can hook in with these things and that these web pages will be updated every time when it is necessary.|S
mn082|we tried to do it so that it must be at least updated only when really major changes happen.|S
mn082|so that means somebody's leaving the group.|S
mn082|uh somebody is joining the group.|S
mn082|a new project is started.|S
mn082|but uh the effort should be minimized as possible.|S
mn082|and so please take a look to the web pages.|S
mn082|and|F
mn082|i have announced in the project area the major headlines.|S
mn082|and especially wilbert maybe you can write something about yours?|Q
mn082|i call it i believe multicast and then development deployment uh for for source specific|D
mn082|maybe a few lines.|S
mn082|maybe a picture.|S
mn082|and something like that should be added to u.s.a.i.a.|S
mn082|okay that's my stuff.|S
mn082|and|F
mn082|um|F
mn082|then the next point is then this active routing stuff.|S
mn082|um|F
mn082|i would like to discuss it before.|S
mn082|but you were busy.|S
mn021|yeah.|S
mn082|and so.|F
mn021|okay.|S
mn082|um|F
mn082|i believe it must be adjusted to the current activities a little bit more.|S
mn021|uhhuh.|S
mn082|and um|F
mn082|i i think it doesn't|D
mn082|it is not worth to discuss it now.|S
mn082|because nobody raised it before.|S
mn021|yeah.|S
mn021|i think so.|S
mn082|and uh so let us have a bilateral discussion afterwards.|S
mn082|i would what i would like to have is that um your contributions is related to certain kind of things happened here.|S
mn082|and that means really to the project proposal itself and also maybe to the u.s.a.i.a. architecture.|S
mn082|in that sense that at certain stages because it's a general architecture certain stages maybe to future mobile core networks that it is related to these kind of things.|S
mn082|um having uh i what i have in mind is that things should not be started from the end system.|S
mn082|that's my principle concern.|S
mn082|because that will never be happen from my point of view.|S
mn082|it should be started as the edge device.|S
mn082|so that it certain kind of mechanism whatever is enabled between the ingress edge device and the outgress edge device.|S
mn082|because it will be at the certain stage i.p. based in the future generation telecommunication networks before its goal.|S
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn021|that's okay.|S
mn082|fuel it to the over the internet.|S
mn082|and between these both boxes i can assume uh because the mobility happens there as a normal natural thing.|S
mn082|and the forwarding process and the routing process should be no more separated from my point of view.|S
mn082|and to have there a certain kind of intelligent mechanism that the packets can be used to set up the routes because they have all the information.|S
mn082|they know where they have to go because i.p. addresses are still there and within the packet.|S
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B
mn082|i mean how can this use uh within this area and how this area is then aligned to the more traditional routing within the internet backbone itself?|Q
mn082|that's my question.|S
mn082|and i think that is good a research area.|S
mn082|then i think there's a lot of|D
mn082|i'm not a expert at all for this.|S
mn082|but i i i believe there's a lot of potential for that.|S
mn082|and we should discuss it maybe bilateral afterwards.|S
mn021|okay.|S
mn021|okay.|S
mn082|yeah?|Q
mn082|so one more time everybody should take a look to the web pages.|S
mn082|and from claudia at the general remarks.|S
mn082|and should write based on the uh headlines in the project proposal the um things what still happened the things what they have still in mind.|S
mn082|uh so that we can update these last you know present the last major part of the web pages.|S
mn030|the pages are already on the web?|Q
mn021|okay.|S
fn083|yeah yeah.|S
mn082|yes.|S
mn030|yeah.|B
fn083|it is.|S
mn082|you can now access it normally with maybe w.w.w.i.c.s.i. berkeley edu.|S
fn083|so there are some gaps.|S
mn030|okay.|B
mn030|huh.|S
mn082|and|F
mn082|so|F
mn030|okay.|S
fn083|yeah so there are some gaps left.|S
fn083|and|F
fn083|i don't know.|F
fn083|you maybe you can also read through the all the text which is on the web pages.|S
fn083|because i'd like to change the text a bit.|S
fn083|because sometimes it's too long.|S
fn083|sometimes it's too short.|S
fn083|maybe the english is not that good.|S
fn083|so|F
fn083|um|F
fn083|but anyways.|F
fn083|so i tried to do this today.|S
fn083|and if you could do it afterwards it would be really nice.|S
fn083|because i'm quite sure that i can't find every like orthographic mistake in it or something.|S
mn021|uh there there there are couple of comments i i have about the web pages.|S
fn083|good.|S
mn021|one is is the uh i think it's joe's uh graphic i think it should be better.|S
fn083|yeah yeah yeah.|S
mn082|yeah.|S
fn083|the graphics are too bad.|S
mn021|maybe you are working at it.|S
fn083|i know.|S
mn082|you are definitely right.|S
mn082|it was in a good shape but it uh then we disturbed.|S
mn021|okay.|S
mn021|and then maybe the the i.c.s.i. logo could be could be could be|D
fn083|i can't change something with a logo.|S
mn021|uh|F
mn021|no.|S
mn021|it is just|D
mn021|uh|F
mn021|maybe we can we can uh translate the white color into transparent color.|S
mn021|so it will get more natural.|S
fn083|yeah.|S
fn083|okay.|S
fn083|good.|S
fn083|yeah i|D
mn021|it's just a suggestion.|S
fn083|another thing is i'd want to get a link on the logo so that you can come from the logo to the icsi web home page back.|S
mn021|to the home page.|S
mn021|okay.|S
mn021|that's that's okay.|S
fn083|so|F
fn083|that's these are some things i have to do.|S
fn083|yeah.|F
fn083|and if you have something which i should put on the web page for you|D
fn083|so|F
fn083|yeah some pictures will be nice.|S
fn083|a few sentences will be nice.|S
fn083|and|F
fn083|yeah it depends on how much time you have.|S
fn083|and then the page for about|D
fn083|so some information for people who are new comers or|D
fn083|i don't know a good word for it.|S
fn083|should we use uh new comers?|Q
fn083|or|D
fn083|so with somebody who is new arriving here or wants to to uh send an application.|S
mn081|newbies.|S
fn083|huh?|Q
mn081|newbies.|S
fn083|newbies?|Q
fn083|yeah okay.|S
fn083|so there i have to add some information.|S
fn083|i don't know i i tried to set up everything by today for this page.|S
fn083|because i've started with this.|S
fn083|um if you have any kind of ideas what was important for you then just let|D
fn083|because i have some points like um i don't know yeah like pacific bell.|S
fn083|like uh long-distance carriers.|S
fn083|then like uh cars and car insurances.|S
fn083|health insurances.|S
fn083|so health insurance is something i can only say for german people.|S
mn021|uhhuh huh.|S
fn083|so maybe|D
fn083|i don't know if this is different in spain.|S
fn083|that would be fine too to have some information or in nnn holland.|S
mn021|okay.|S
fn083|i don't know.|S
mn021|i will take a look and i will tell you something.|S
fn083|yeah.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
fn083|so how maybe how you did it or whatsoever.|S
mn082|okay.|S
mn082|i will send you some because i have something in mind.|S
fn083|so|F
fn083|yeah.|S
fn083|then what else did i have?|Q
fn083|then|F
fn083|another point's like uh what about the bank.|S
fn083|uh so transferring your money from europe over here what is the cheapest way or what could you recommend or something?|Q
fn083|um|F
fn083|another point.|S
fn083|yeah and then there's there's another point like going out in berkeley or what to do in berkeley or in the neighborhood.|S
mn081|this a lot of this stuff is not networking group n.s.a. uh restricted.|S
fn083|no.|S
fn083|i know.|S
mn082|yeah but nobody do that you know.|S
fn083|i know.|S
fn083|but there's nothing like this on the on the icsi page as far as i know.|S
mn082|so|F
mn082|that's the point.|S
mn082|we discussed it still a couple of weeks or months ago.|S
mn082|uh the point is normally it is an i.c.s.i. task anyway.|S
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn082|but|F
mn081|yeah but at least then it should be huh i think be uh i.c.s.i. part and not network restricted.|S
mn082|right.|B
mn021|well they have uh a a white booklet you know probably|D
mn082|yeah that is from nineteen ninety one or nineteen ninety two you know.|S
fn083|yeah but it's not in the|D
fn083|this is not on the web.|S
mn082|and this is not on the web.|S
mn021|no.|S
mn021|no no.|S
mn082|and the the the|D
mn021|i i just i|D
mn082|people|D
mn082|normally that's was my my uh|D
mn021|in fact the pacific bell phone was not working for example.|S
mn021|when i tried the the phone on this booklet it was not working.|S
mn082|huh.|B
mn021|but the thing is that maybe this could be on a starting point or or if digest|D
fn083|yeah.|S
fn083|i don't know.|F
fn083|maybe i talk with jane about this.|S
fn083|if we can use this information i don't know somewhere on the icsi home page too.|S
mn081|move it on the normal icsi i.c.s.i.|S
fn083|yeah.|S
fn083|maybe.|S
mn081|maybe every group has somewhere hidden uh a uh deep outgoing|D
mn082|we can do that.|S
mn082|yeah but the point is that nobody feel responsible for that.|S
mn082|and if it's|D
mn081|yeah but uh but my point is that it should not be under the networking group thing.|S
mn021|it's a common|D
mn082|yes.|S
mn082|uh yes.|S
mn081|uh but|D
mn082|i see there your point.|S
mn081|okay.|S
mn082|that's right.|S
mn082|but if it is under the networking points the group leader is responsible to get up to date information.|S
mn082|i believe we are the group where the people are uh changing much more faster to join the group and to leave the group as other groups.|S
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn082|and so the most problem as as of uh it's likely that uh the people here in this group needs this information um much more uh often as as other groups.|S
mn081|but|F
mn081|but that could still be applicable if you put it under the icsi site if you take the responsibility for that.|S
mn082|yes.|S
mn082|i see|D
fn083|yeah i talk to jane about this.|S
mn081|uh|D
mn082|yeah.|S
mn081|so i think i think both arguments are not an are arguments against having this under the normal i.c.s.i. page.|S
mn082|but we we can do that.|S
mn081|or only the networking uh page.|S
mn035|but the problem is are you allowed to change anything on the general icsi server?|Q
mn081|yeah.|B
fn083|no.|S
fn083|this is why i have to talk to jane.|S
mn035|yeah.|B
mn082|yeah that's|D
mn082|yeah.|S
mn035|so you may need just a link from the main icsi page to the n.s.a. page.|S
mn082|that's a|D
mn082|we have the we have the directory structure of the real unix tree in compliance and in accordance with what you with the structure of the web pages.|S
mn082|and um that means uh the group leader normally do not have access to the general web pages.|S
mn082|he has access to the n.s.a. pages.|S
mn082|and um|F
mn082|but i think that's an administration problem and that everybody agrees that the information page must be on the general on the highest level.|S
mn082|okay.|S
mn082|i have no problem with that.|S
mn030|but uh|F
mn082|but|F
mn082|but i think we discuss if still|D
mn030|your argument is uh i think it we have to have the right to change it.|S
mn035|yeah.|B
mn030|so if there's anything changing in insurances or something something like that that we have access to this page further on to to make any changes.|S
mn081|yeah.|B
fn083|yeah but this is not a problem at all.|S
fn083|i i mean if you are coming from germany and you know that there is something changed with the health insurance then you send jane an email like could you please change this blah blah blah.|S
mn030|yeah but it's much more complicated.|S
mn035|yeah but that's that's effort.|S
mn035|that's the whole problem that nobody wants to do it.|S
mn030|yeah.|B
mn082|yeah.|B
fn083|yeah okay.|S
mn082|you know how it you know the process here within the n.s.a. group.|S
mn082|you know.|F
fn083|yes.|S
mn082|and and that was a reason i we finally decided here that we put it information on the n.s.a. page.|S
mn082|we have this discussed still a couple of months ago ago.|S
mn030|i think the best solution is really to put a link on the i.c.s.i. page to this stuff.|S
mn081|yeah.|S
mn035|yep.|D
mn030|and the stuff itself is uh located at our server.|S
mn082|in our directory.|S
mn030|yeah.|S
mn030|in our directory.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn030|yeah.|B
mn082|yeah we can do that.|S
fn083|yes also fine.|S
mn082|we then create a link and then we have to ask with jane.|S
fn083|yeah.|S
mn082|okay.|S
fn083|another point is i want i want to would like to add another button something which is called like events or i don't know yeah i guess i call it events.|S
mn021|huh.|B
fn083|like where we could uh announce talks which are you know future talks for the future.|S
fn083|or and where we could also have a link on for instance the two workshops which have going on uh last summer.|S
fn083|so hannes' workshop and then the workshop from oliver.|S
fn083|that there might be a link behind these workshops and or former talks we have.|S
fn083|so like from people who have been here before.|S
fn083|and he wants to uh publish their slides or an article or whatsoever behind there.|S
fn083|so that we have like a button for events which are where workshops can be announced or old workshops could could be um shown or whatever.|S
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn082|of course that is a living thing.|S
mn082|i think it's a good idea.|S
mn082|not only that the workshop was a talk announce because they are still announce it is a broader sense.|S
mn082|uh but i think the idea from claudia is very good that the slides from the talks here if it's worth to have it on the web anyway um should be published in that way that the people can access it.|S
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn082|for instance i have my u.s.a.i.a. slides.|S
mn082|maybe if some things and is going on maybe you have some multicast slides concerning your work at i.g.m.p.|S
mn021|yeah.|S
mn021|that's okay too.|S
mn082|and uh|F
mn082|and if we have some talks from exterm and we had some in the past we can also put the slides on on these things.|S
mn082|because then they're still still a growing context for us opportunity for the people you know there.|S
mn082|oh.|S
mn082|this guy did something there.|S
mn082|maybe i can contact him and ask him would you like to do something contribute whatever.|S
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B
mn082|uh so.|F
mn082|that's and i think it's a great idea from claudia to to have this event page.|S
mn082|because it's not a big deal.|S
mn082|you know.|F
fn083|no it's easy to to add it.|S
mn082|it's it's|D
fn083|i mean.|F
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|and then it's|D
mn082|nah okay.|F
mn082|if there are no events then there are no events.|S
fn083|yeah yeah.|S
mn082|but we still have a few which happened in the last year.|S
mn082|and okay.|S
mn082|then it is a growing thing.|S
mn082|but it's done automatically that the group leader or the group uh put some things uh also on the web.|S
mn082|something in the center pipe.|S
mn082|yeah?|Q
mn082|everybody agree?|Q
mn030|um i don't know.|S
mn021|okay.|S
mn030|maybe it could be a good thing if we have such an event button that um somewhere beneath this button or wherever that there's a date when the last update was.|S
mn030|so that you know it's worth to click this button to see there's a new um announcement or not.|S
fn083|yeah okay.|S
mn030|so otherwise you are often clicking this button.|S
mn030|and you get your old information or even an uh empty page.|S
mn082|maybe there's|D
fn083|yeah but this will be then down on the button of the page anyways.|S
mn082|yeah maybe we can have updated on you know the button itself.|S
mn030|so|F
mn030|yeah.|S
mn030|something like that.|S
mn082|and then updated and the current date when when something happened.|S
mn030|last updated.|S
mn030|yeah.|B
mn082|i don't know how we deal with that.|S
fn083|yep.|B
mn082|is it another thing we have to?|Q
fn083|yep.|B
mn030|so it's just a suggestion.|S
mn030|i don't know how easy it is to to implement something like that.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
fn083|huh.|B
fn083|okay.|S
mn082|okay you|D
mn082|well.|F
mn082|let's consider update event button.|S
mn082|okay.|F
mn082|so and then the next point and i believe yeah so not the last one is one that i would like to know the status as far it is possible from everybody concerning his future intention here at i.c.s.i. or whether when he will leave whether he can or will he consider currently uh contribute here to the proposal.|S
mn082|because you know i've i'm facing the problem if i go back to siemens.|S
mn082|and i say okay.|S
mn082|there's a potential.|S
mn082|there are potential contacts.|S
mn082|currently maybe no money.|S
mn082|but if we go in one direction it it is worth to know if people can still go on in that area of that kind of work then they are back in their university or their company or whatever.|S
mn082|and even if it's nur part-time jobs and and if it's come to a real proposal that maybe the people can hook in uh one more time.|S
mn082|because i need this information definitely uh to inform the uh the siemens management that it's worth to send me back here.|S
mn082|so maybe wilbert you can start.|S
mn082|you will leave end of january definitely.|S
mn082|and currently you see no chance as far as i know uh to stay longer here.|S
mn082|and either you will go back to k.p.n. or you will stay here and find then a job opportunity another company.|S
mn082|is that right?|Q
mn081|yes.|S
mn081|yeah.|S
mn082|can you give us more details of concerning the status?|Q
mn081|no.|S
mn082|no?|Q
mn081|no.|S
mn081|pending.|S
mn082|pending.|S
mn081|yeah.|S
fn083|see for me it's the same.|S
fn083|i can also say uh|D
fn083|for me everything has completely changed.|S
fn083|so now i go back and i don't anything what to do.|S
fn083|so it's like i have to sort everything out when i'm back in germany.|S
mn082|yes.|S
mn082|but you have no|D
fn083|but i won't go back to the university.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
fn083|so|F
fn083|i don't think so.|S
mn082|so you are looking for a job.|S
mn082|that's probably then okay.|S
mn082|in principle i would like to say you are lost for the n.s.a. group.|S
fn083|then it's like|D
fn083|yeah.|B
mn082|because ffft that's uh it would be a a wonder if uh it hook in at the same area you know.|S
fn083|yeah.|B
fn083|no no no.|S
fn083|yeah.|B
mn081|uh but that's also for me.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn081|i'm kind of lost for the n.s.a. group.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|i think so yeah.|S
fn083|lost is maybe a bit like|D
mn081|and oh also also|D
mn082|ja.|S
mn082|from the work contributions you know.|S
mn081|well|F
mn081|but i think even also k.p.n. is lost for the uh for the i.c.s.i.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn082|yeah.|B
mn082|uh do you know whether they have|D
mn081|there's a lot of uh budget cuts going on.|S
mn081|and nothing is possible anymore.|S
mn081|so|F
mn082|um so from your side the statement is um that uh independently of your person uh the k.p.n. is not they're not willing to send us another guy here to i.c.s.i. anyway.|S
mn081|yes.|S
mn081|absolutely.|S
mn082|and if they are interested in uh a certain kind of project then it must be related to a certain kind of really service or a certain kind of end system or real product or whatever kind of thing with respect to u.m.t.s.|S
mn081|it it will be different thing.|S
mn082|right?|Q
mn081|it will be a it will be a start-up.|S
mn081|and i know they're they're working on a a few of them in this area.|S
mn081|but it's outside of i.c.s.i.|S
mn082|huh.|S
mn082|so|F
mn082|k.p.n. and and i.c.s.i. in principle.|S
mn081|yeah.|S
mn082|after you will leave here that is.|S
mn082|yeah and then what do you intend to do in the last two months beside of course looking for|D
mn030|holidays.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn081|um i am working now on on something.|S
mn081|uh an open source router.|S
mn082|this is that from from mark right?|S
mn081|no.|S
mn081|in|D
mn082|not?|Q
mn081|well it's a little bit out of mark.|S
mn081|i'm|D
mn081|right now i'm interested and i'm looking into it.|S
mn081|and i'm working started yesterday actually working on it.|S
mn081|to do the uh to do an implementation of the protocol that was designed by mark um on an open source router that's different from the one that of mark's project.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|S
mn082|yeah do you finish that and do you believe that you can finish that until end of january?|Q
mn081|i hope so.|S
mn082|it sounded sounded to me a little bit little bit hard hard hard time constraint right?|S
mn081|that would be cool.|S
mn081|yeah.|B
mn081|it's|D
mn081|hard work.|S
mn081|yeah.|S
mn081|that's right.|S
mn081|but i'm working on it.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn082|okay.|S
mn082|miguel maybe you can say also.|S
mn021|oh i'll be i'll be here until the end of july.|S
mn021|and uh|F
mn021|well uh|F
mn021|even later if uh there is some interesting work uh going on.|S
mn021|well i i will be able to to do some work from spain too.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn021|so that's my future uh forecast.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|S
mn082|and uh do you have some students which could be join if there is|D
mn021|yeah.|B
mn082|i assume there is a certain activity.|S
mn082|maybe if you will leave in july|D
mn021|yeah well you know uh the problem the i think that we have a a problem or a difference in spain at least compared with the americans.|S
mn021|and is that our students are uh are not getting involved in research until they have uh finished their studies.|S
mn021|so uh it's something a little bit uh strange.|S
mn021|but it is this this is the|D
mn082|what?|Q
mn082|they are not|D
mn082|sorry?|Q
mn082|they are not involved in in research?|Q
mn021|yeah.|S
mn021|you know|D
mn082|what they are doing then?|Q
mn082|i'm sorry.|S
mn081|lectures.|S
mn082|huh?|Q
mn021|you know they|D
mn082|ach so ach so|D
mn082|okay.|S
mn021|you you have to to pass the different tests.|S
mn021|and you have to study the different subjects.|S
mn021|and until you have finished with this uh well okay you can do it by by your own.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn021|but but the thing is that you're not supposed to do it.|S
mn021|and usually students are pretty busy for not doing other things.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn021|uh|F
mn030|and there's no final master's thesis or something like that what they have to perform?|Q
mn021|uh yeah them nnn not really.|S
mn021|you know there is.|S
mn021|there is.|S
mn030|uhhuh.|B
mn021|but uh it is not a research work.|S
mn021|usually it's an application work.|S
mn021|so you build a web site your own e. commerce site uh whatever.|S
mn030|uhhuh.|B
mn021|or a program or|D
mn082|why i didn't study in spain?|Q
mn021|but|D
mn021|but it is not uh something your teacher provides you some research papers and you let's say build a simulator or try to.|S
mn082|huh.|B
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn030|uhhuh.|B
mn082|are certain tasks?|Q
mn030|okay.|B
mn082|and so|D
mn021|so|F
mn021|we have uh other students are which are uh huh people that has a grant.|S
mn021|and they are they are starting as uh researchers.|S
mn021|ah but this is only connected to your own funding.|S
mn021|so if you if you have projects you can have uh people working with you.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn021|if you don't have a research project well you cannot pay them.|S
mn021|so usually you don't have anybody.|S
mn021|so it's kind of uh dependent on the funding we have in some projects.|S
mn021|so|F
mn021|it's not sure.|S
mn082|no.|S
mn021|not really sure.|S
mn082|there.|S
mn082|we're not talking about to send the students here to i.c.s.i.|S
mn082|i'm talking if there is an activity at least with the n.s.a. group that certain kind of activities also in the university could apply for the master works of diplomas thesis uh whatever kind of thing that|D
mn021|yeah.|S
mn021|we we|D
mn021|i think we could we could find uh some uh work force.|S
mn021|okay?|Q
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn021|because well you you can uh redirect you know the the work as uh let's say as a subject work of something that you can you can try to uh|D
mn021|in some subjects in fact uh the the the uh topics are more open.|S
mn021|so you can introduce some research topics too.|S
mn021|so|F
mn021|but the main thing is that there is a uh this big difference.|S
mn021|because uh students are not supposed to do research uh work until they have finished their their grade.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn081|you can change that.|S
mn021|yeah.|S
mn021|sure.|S
mn081|uh maybe you|D
mn021|sure.|S
mn081|i think it's pretty healthy for a student to to have a project uh where you have to write actually some part of research.|S
mn081|or|F
mn021|yeah i think so too.|S
mn021|but uh you know it also depends on the subjects.|S
mn021|because sometimes subjects are fixed.|S
mn081|sure.|S
mn021|so you cannot you cannot uh uh give any any stuff you want.|S
mn081|okay.|S
mn021|you have to to provide a certain a certain prime for the subject too.|S
mn081|of course.|S
mn021|but you know sometimes especially in the in the latest uh uh courses uh things are probably more open.|S
mn021|and well it it is something that can be changed.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn082|okay.|B
mn082|thank you.|D
mn082|claudia i still mentioned have you other things?|Q
mn082|for me as i said before i will be funded by a uh by the ministry of uh the german government for research in the project so-called invinet.|S
mn082|that seems to be sure.|S
mn082|and i got absolutely freedom to do what i would like to do.|S
mn082|and i would like to go on with the q.s. in advance mechanism.|S
mn082|and uh|F
mn082|in the relation of u.s.a.i.a.i. also have the activities with georgia tech.|S
mn082|they have now a p.h.d.|S
mn082|it is settled.|S
mn082|and my other next uh generation of contract is also going in that sense so the topic is still going going on.|S
mn082|and when i will come back here i would like to use these things too to maybe come to a closer a bigger project um outside of this goal with contributions here from uh first of all from the n.s.a. group and then from from other partners.|S
mn082|but this i have definitely uh discussed with my management.|S
mn082|and this will happened i believe in december.|S
mn082|maybe and in the beginning of january.|S
mn082|and i will keep informed to the management of i.c.s.i. anyway.|S
mn082|but also i assume that my suggestions that we have a weekly phone conference and email exchange during that time.|S
mn082|so that we can inform each other concerning what are the questions what are the problems what is the status and so on.|S
mn082|uh|F
mn082|but i think we will uh detail these things then in one of the last meetings.|S
mn082|so|F
mn082|how is your status and and your ideas and your plans and your future and|D
mn030|yeah.|S
mn030|well.|F
mn030|i will|D
mn082|you're addicted to the testbeds you run on the hour.|S
mn030|no no no no no.|S
mn082|so that's|D
mn030|so i will stay here till the end of february.|S
mn030|and|F
mn030|afterwards um at berlin i'm yeah funded by an institution of the german government.|S
mn030|so|F
mn030|they are paying me.|S
mn030|and i have to do research for them of course.|S
mn030|i have to um well uh reach some goals and so on.|S
mn030|but on the other hand there will be some time left i think to do some work on this area i started here.|S
mn030|and for me myself i'm also very interested in in continue this work.|S
mn030|and so that will be manageable.|S
mn030|and um|F
mn030|on the other hand there are also uh some students or|D
mn030|well.|F
mn030|at the moment it's quite difficult to find students uh who are doing their master's thesis and so on.|S
mn030|because there are not a lot of students uh which are in this state in germany now.|S
mn030|but um|F
mn030|about two years ago the numbers of students were um studying computer science uh started to increase again.|S
mn030|and so in one or two years we will have uh many students uh which are performing their master's thesis.|S
mn030|and so i think there will also be uh many students which are joining in this work.|S
mn030|so hopefully uh i will found will find some students which are joining in.|S
mn030|and um|F
mn030|so hopefully this work will be go on.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn082|okay.|S
mn082|sounded good to me.|S
mn082|and michael?|Q
mn035|so i won't change the topic then.|S
mn035|i'm here until end of may.|S
mn035|and after that i presumably going to a siemens project with some department of gee mens.|S
mn035|but related to that topic what i have done here.|S
mn035|so|F
mn035|it's some of pre stage to that.|S
mn035|so it might be more related or loosely related.|S
mn035|so it's at least it's in the same topic.|S
mn035|and progress it's going on.|S
mn035|but it's not that fast going on as i would have like it.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn035|oh.|D
mn035|i would like to have it.|S
mn035|sorry.|S
mn035|well.|F
mn035|but oder?|D
mn082|yeah then what is the current status anyway?|S
mn035|um i'm currently i'm looking into quality of service routing.|S
mn082|this is.|S
mn035|and i had discussions with a post doc from the u. u.c.b.|S
mn035|well.|F
mn035|we want to we started to collect information to write the paper about quality of serving routing for m.p.l.s. in an m.p.l.s. domain.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn035|so you have um distributed routing at the edges.|S
mn035|and one aspect is that the information is outdated so that you know to always have the exact information of your links dates and so on.|S
mn035|it what we have plans of that.|S
mn035|and trying to look at some routing policies or routing algorithms.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|B
mn082|now as i see in principle uh fff that's a really raw view.|S
mn082|m.p.l.s. offers certain kind of success of active routing.|S
mn082|because in principle the forwarding pass is a little bit decoupled from this from the routing pass.|S
mn035|yeah.|S
mn082|and this was in principle.|S
mn082|okay.|S
mn082|it's it's not really the subject.|S
mn035|it it|D
mn082|but in a broader sense it could be seen in that sense.|S
mn035|it yeah.|B
mn082|i think uh there are in a certain degree some alignment with with both of you guys.|S
mn035|yeah.|S
mn082|right?|Q
mn035|so at least from the definition of christian tschudin m.p.l.s. is a subset of of active active routing.|S
mn035|so it's very it's static?|Q
mn035|it's no active?|S
mn035|but it's sort of active because they have these program statements.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|maybe it's a separation in principle that i do not use the normal traditional uh data forwarding pass and update in principle only the routing information uh to to to use it.|S
mn035|but|D
mn035|yeah.|B
mn035|yeah.|B
mn021|well they are they are using the the the same idea of labelling packets with a with a content descriptor or something.|S
mn082|yeah.|B
mn082|yeah.|B
mn035|yeah.|B
mn035|that's right.|S
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|so what i mean is at a certain degree yeah that has to be figured out.|S
mn021|yeah.|B
mn021|there's a connection point.|S
mn082|there is uh there are some linkage between them in both of your your work.|S
mn021|uhhuh.|B
mn035|yeah.|B
mn082|so|F
mn082|my last point uh in principle is the proposal itself.|S
mn082|um|F
mn082|i know in the past it was always if i'm not writing something nothing going to happen.|S
mn082|so i believe wilbert you are going out of these activity.|S
mn082|you have to use your time to finish your work as you uh have in mind until your end of february.|S
mn082|or is that right?|Q
mn081|january.|S
mn081|yes.|S
mn082|end of january.|S
mn082|sorry.|S
mn082|so you will not you will not find any time to contribute anymore to this activity.|S
mn081|no.|S
mn082|okay.|S
mn082|then from miguel's side i expect more detailed vision.|S
mn082|we can do it as i mentioned before bilateral afterwards uh concerning your work and how you think it could be beneficial contribution to the activity maybe based on the generic uh uh u.s.a.i.a. architecture.|S
mn021|later.|S
mn082|i will write as long as i have time here uh on the proposal itself.|S
mn082|and in the near term future i will distribute a list of the small cluster of people.|S
mn082|i tried to access juan peire several times.|S
mn082|he didn't answer because he still had mentioned that there's some minor funding that i think would help.|S
mn082|for instance to have initial meeting either here or in europe or or wherever.|S
mn082|i've uh contact one more time the professor.|S
mn082|what is his name?|Q
mn082|rao?|Q
mn082|or|D
mn082|uh landay mentioned uh|D
mn035|landay?|Q
mn082|rao right?|S
mn082|yeah.|S
mn082|because he's a professor in uh responsible for the infrastructure at u.c.b. and he has some projects which are related to um these these uh activities.|S
mn035|landay.|S
mn035|uh.|D
mn082|i would name it intelligent classroom.|S
mn082|i don't know whether i can succeed to get an appointment then.|S
mn082|but i will distribute a list contact list and the interests of each partner.|S
mn082|so that everybody can see and everybody knows yeah i have in mind.|S
mn082|maybe it's a small n.s.a. group activity itself with no linkage to the outer world.|S
mn082|maybe it's a n.s.a. group activity with a linkage to the outer world based on the uh universities at home or the companies at home.|S
mn082|there's some linkage.|S
mn082|and the third stage is let's say there's a n.s.a. group activity in this area uh with the supported um home entities and with certain kind of linkage here to the companies or or universities here in this area.|S
mn082|the last one i think it's uh the best one.|S
mn082|but you see the question is always where's the money.|S
mn082|and i say oh poo.|S
mn082|currently i don't know.|S
mn082|the second question is how long i stay here.|S
mn082|and say ooo i don't know.|S
mn082|so|F
mn082|everybody's waiting.|S
mn082|yeah?|Q
mn082|and the only um activity could come from the n.s.a. group itself.|S
mn082|but i think it's a a work in process and that it will take some time and uh everything must be just settled a little bit more.|S
mn082|so but anyway i would like to get contributions from the people here of the n.s.a. group concerning proposals.|S
mn082|this is a living thing.|S
mn082|and|F
mn082|it's a pity that multicast is in principle removed.|S
mn082|and we do not have any expert from multicast anymore.|S
mn082|and uh that's makes very hard i believe.|S
mn082|because that is a major at least twenty five percent of the whole network uh stuff.|S
mn082|and um|F
mn082|but neverless we have to live with this situation.|S
mn082|right.|F
mn082|you are laughing again?|Q
mn081|right.|S
mn081|right.|S
mn082|so maybe we have to rewrite something.|S
mn082|have new ideas going forward more in certain kind of really telecommunication network and the routing and q.s. stuff.|S
mn082|and remove in principle the multicast stuff.|S
mn082|which in principle a pity because i think that's a really really good uh uh huh source of research work for the future telecommunication core networks.|S
mn082|because they are still not able to deal with multicast.|S
mn082|they still have there that tunnel generations and all those kind of things.|S
mn082|and i i believe that would be very beneficial to use it for the really uh mobile scenarios in in that network.|S
mn082|so but anyway we have to live with a real situation.|S
mn082|and that means we have to drop multicast from the proposal.|S
mn082|any comments?|Q
mn021|oh not really you know.|S
mn021|uh i i i i think that well in the future somebody will come to the n.s.a. group.|S
mn021|uh|F
mn082|then we can extend the proposal one more time with multicast.|S
mn021|uh|D
mn021|so|F
mn021|no i mean that|D
mn021|okay.|F
mn021|i i i think that it cannot uh be uh considered the first type task to do.|S
mn021|because nobody is is knowledgeable about multicasting.|S
mn021|but i think that uh any of us could address these things in the future.|S
mn021|or maybe a new person could address this in the future.|S
mn021|so|F
mn021|if|D
mn021|i mean what i think is that uh it it makes no sense to me to reduce uh uh uh uh something which is more or less complete.|S
mn021|because we don't have the person.|S
mn021|i think that the the way to to go is probably the opposite to try to find something which has a meaning by itself.|S
mn021|and then try to get the resources to to to do this.|S
mn082|oh maybe you understand me in the wrong way.|S
mn082|uh|F
mn082|i do not mean to drop it to remove the text from the proposal.|S
mn021|okay.|S
mn021|okay.|S
mn082|i mean activities planning activities.|S
mn021|sorry.|S
mn021|yeah.|S
mn021|that's okay.|S
mn082|work packages.|S
mn021|sorry sorry.|S
mn021|heh.|F
mn082|yeah.|S
mn021|now i|D
mn082|so|F
mn082|no no.|S
mn082|because that's uh that's why i mentioned that it is important thing.|S
mn082|but currently there's only one new group member sven buchholz who will figure out the thing huh how to say um the taking into account the end system or the limited end system capabilities with respect to mobility and the network itself.|S
mn082|where it should be where should be uh the adaptation process performed to deal with the different devices for ubiquitous access to the network?|Q
mn082|should it be in the end system itself?|Q
mn082|should be in the edge device?|Q
mn082|it should it be in the core?|Q
mn082|should it be on the server?|Q
mn082|these are the questions he would like to figure out.|S
mn082|and to uh to have in principle the pro and cons of uh different of all these different approaches.|S
mn082|so that's the only new member.|S
mn081|who is that?|Q
mn082|sven buchholz.|S
mn082|he was here.|S
mn082|i invited him and discussed with him his potential work i.|S
mn082|quite sure.|S
mn081|oh he was here one day.|S
mn082|yeah.|S
fn083|yeah.|S
mn035|huh.|S
mn082|but he showed up the next day.|S
mn035|several days.|S
mn082|but only for administration stuff.|S
mn035|yeah.|B
mn082|but for the technical discussion he was here one day.|S
mn035|yeah.|B
mn035|yeah.|B
mn082|i'm do not remember whether whether you were|D
fn083|that must be three weeks ago.|S
fn083|because i i just met him when i arrived.|S
mn081|yeah i do remember him.|S
mn035|yeah.|B
mn081|but i didn't talk with him about uh about the research topic.|S
mn082|uhhuh.|S
mn081|so i didn't know what he was going to do.|S
mn082|yeah he will come mid of january i believe.|S
mn082|yeah.|S
mn035|uhhuh.|B
mn082|as far as i know.|S
mn082|so but this is the only guy you know.|S
mn082|but that is not reflected in that sense that we remove the text.|S
mn082|what i mean is is uh the that we what's kind of activity we are going more in detail in describing the network packages and and detailed uh uh descriptions more detailed descriptions.|S
mn021|okay.|S
mn082|so|F
mn082|any other question?|Q
mn082|any other comment?|Q
mn082|oh.|S
mn082|then we should start with reading the numbers.|S
mn082|one more time.|S
fn083|oh again?|Q
mn081|we have to do that?|Q
mn081|oh.|S
mn082|yes.|S
mn082|we have to do it.|S
fn083|i don't know.|S
mn082|so that means we have to read the transcript script number and then the numbers.|S
mn082|and if there's a new line a short break.|S
mn082|and afterwards we have to|D
mn082|uh that device is switched on.|S
mn082|so please do not switch off the devices.|S
mn082|and i will call herr janin and that adam.|S
mn082|so i will start.|S
