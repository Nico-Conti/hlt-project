me013|so uh|F|Bro024
me013|yeah.|F|Bro024
me013|the suggestion was to have these guys start to|D|Bro024
me018|okay.|B|Bro024
me018|why don't you go ahead dave?|Q|Bro024
me026|okay.|S|Bro024
me026|um|F|Bro024
me026|so yeah the this past week i've been mainly occupied with um getting some results from the s.r.i. system trained on this short hub five training set for the mean subtraction method.|S|Bro024
me026|and um|F|Bro024
me026|i ran some tests last night.|S|Bro024
me026|but um|F|Bro024
me026|the results are suspicious.|S|Bro024
me026|um it's um because they're the baseline results are worse than um andreas than results andreas got previously.|S|Bro024
me026|and it could have something to do with um|D|Bro024
me018|that's on digits?|Q|Bro024
me026|that's on digits.|S|Bro024
me026|it it it could it could have something to do with um downsampling.|S|Bro024
me018|huh.|B|Bro024
me026|that's that's worth looking into.|S|Bro024
me026|um|F|Bro024
me026|and um|F|Bro024
me026|apart from that i guess the the main thing i have i have to talk is um where i'm planning to go over the next week.|S|Bro024
me026|um|F|Bro024
me026|so i've been working on integrating this mean subtraction approach into the smartkom system.|S|Bro024
me026|and there's this question of well so um in my tests before with h.t.k.i. found it worked it worked the best with about twelve seconds of data used to estimate the mean.|S|Bro024
me026|but we'll often have less in the smartkom system.|S|Bro024
me026|um|F|Bro024
me026|so i think we'll use as much data as we have at a particular time.|S|Bro024
me026|and we'll we'll concatenate utterances together um to get as much data as we possibly can from the user.|S|Bro024
me026|but um there's a question of how to set up the models so um we could train the models.|S|Bro024
me026|if we think twelve seconds is ideal we could train the models using twelve seconds to calculate the mean to mean subtract the training data.|S|Bro024
me026|or we could um use some other amount.|S|Bro024
me026|so like i did an experiment where i um was using six seconds in test.|S|Bro024
me026|um but for i tried twelve seconds in train.|S|Bro024
me026|and i tried um um the same in train.|S|Bro024
me026|i'm i tried six seconds in train.|S|Bro024
me026|and six seconds in train was about point three percent better.|S|Bro024
me026|um and um it's not clear to me yet whether that's something significant.|S|Bro024
me026|so i want to do some tests and um actually make some plots of um for a particular amount of data and test what happens if you vary the amount of data in train.|S|Bro024
me018|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
me013|uh guenter i don't know if you followed this stuff but this is uh a uh uh long-term long-term window f.f.t.'s.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah he you talked about it.|S|Bro024
mn058|we we spoke about it already.|S|Bro024
me013|oh okay.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|so you know what he's doing.|S|Bro024
me013|all right.|S|Bro024
me026|so i was i actually ran the experiments mostly.|S|Bro024
me026|and i i was i was hoping to have the plots with me today.|S|Bro024
me026|i just didn't get to it.|S|Bro024
me026|but um|F|Bro024
me026|yeah i i would be curious about people's feedback on this.|S|Bro024
me026|because i'm i i think there are some i think it's it's kind of like a a bit of a tricky engineering problem.|S|Bro024
me026|i'm trying to figure out what's the optimal way to set this up.|S|Bro024
me026|so um i'll try to make the plots and then put some postscript up on my on my web page.|S|Bro024
me026|and i'll mention it in my status report if people want to take a look.|S|Bro024
me013|you could clarify something for me.|S|Bro024
me013|you're saying point three percent.|S|Bro024
me013|you take a point three percent hit when the training and testing links are don't match or something?|Q|Bro024
me013|is that what it is?|Q|Bro024
me013|or|D|Bro024
me026|well it|D|Bro024
me026|i i don't think it it's just for any mismatch you take a hit.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|B|Bro024
me026|in some cases it might be better to have a mismatch.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|B|Bro024
me026|like i think i saw something like like if you only have two seconds in test or um maybe it was something like four seconds you actually do a little better if you um train on six seconds than if you train on four seconds.|S|Bro024
me013|right.|B|Bro024
me026|um|F|Bro024
me026|but the case uh with the point three percent hit was using six seconds in test um comparing train on twelve seconds versus train on six seconds.|S|Bro024
me013|and which was worse?|Q|Bro024
me026|the train on twelve seconds.|S|Bro024
me013|okay.|S|Bro024
me013|but point three percent uh from what to what?|Q|Bro024
me013|that's point three percent.|S|Bro024
me026|on the the the accuracies went from it was something vaguely like ninety five point six accuracy um improved to ninety five point nine when i|D|Bro024
me013|so four point four to four point one.|S|Bro024
me026|okay.|S|Bro024
me013|so yeah.|F|Bro024
me013|so about a about an eight percent uh seven or eight percent relative.|S|Bro024
me026|okay.|S|Bro024
me013|uh|F|Bro024
me013|yeah.|F|Bro024
me013|well i think in a you know if if you were going for an evaluation system you'd care.|S|Bro024
me013|but if you were doing a live system that people were actually using nobody would notice.|S|Bro024
me013|it's uh i think the thing is to get something that's practical that that you could really use.|S|Bro024
me026|huh.|S|Bro024
me026|that's that's interesting.|S|Bro024
me026|all right the uh i see your point.|S|Bro024
me026|i guess i was thinking of it as um an interesting research problem.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me026|the how to i was thinking that for the a.s.r.u. paper we could have a section saying for smartkom we we in we tried this approach in uh interactive system which i don't think has been done before.|S|Bro024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me026|and and then there was two research questions from that.|S|Bro024
me026|and one is the does it still work if you just use the past history.|S|Bro024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me026|all right.|S|Bro024
me026|and the other was this question of um what i was just talking about now.|S|Bro024
me026|so i guess that's why i thought it was interesting.|S|Bro024
me013|i mean a short time f.f.t. short time cepstrum calculation uh mean mean calculation work that people have in commercial systems they do this all the time.|S|Bro024
me013|they the they calculate it from previous utterances and then use it you know.|S|Bro024
me026|yeah.|B|Bro024
me026|um|B|Bro024
me013|but but uh|F|Bro024
me013|as you say there hasn't been that much with this long longtime uh spectra work.|S|Bro024
me013|uh|F|Bro024
me026|oh oh okay.|S|Bro024
me026|so that's that's that's standard.|S|Bro024
me026|um|F|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|pretty common.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me026|okay.|S|Bro024
me013|um|F|Bro024
me013|but uh|F|Bro024
me013|yes.|F|Bro024
me013|no it is interesting.|S|Bro024
me013|and the other thing is i mean there's two sides to these really small uh gradations in performance.|S|Bro024
me013|um i mean on the one hand in a practical system if something is uh four point four percent error four point one percent error people won't really tell be able to tell the difference.|S|Bro024
me013|on the other hand when you're doing uh research you may uh you might find that the way that you build up a change from a ninety five percent accurate system to a ninety eight percent accurate system is through ten or twelve little things that you do that each are point three percent.|S|Bro024
me013|so so the they they it's i don't mean to say that they're they're irrelevant.|S|Bro024
me013|uh they are relevant.|S|Bro024
me013|but um for a demo you won't see it.|S|Bro024
me026|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me026|right.|S|Bro024
me026|okay.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|B|Bro024
me026|and um|F|Bro024
me026|let's let's see.|F|Bro024
me026|um|F|Bro024
me026|okay.|S|Bro024
me026|and then there's um another thing i want to start looking at um is um the choice of the analysis window length.|S|Bro024
me026|so i've just been using two seconds.|S|Bro024
me026|just because that's what carlos did before.|S|Bro024
me026|uh i wrote to him asking about he chose the two seconds.|S|Bro024
me026|and it seemed like he chose it a bit informally.|S|Bro024
me026|so um|F|Bro024
me026|with the with the h.t.k. set-up i should be able to do some experiments on just varying that length.|S|Bro024
me026|say between one and three seconds in a few different reverberation conditions.|S|Bro024
me026|um say this room and also a few of the artificial impulse responses we have for reverberation.|S|Bro024
me026|just um making some plots and seeing how they look.|S|Bro024
me026|and um|F|Bro024
me026|so|F|Bro024
me026|with the the sampling rate i was using one second or two seconds or four seconds is at a power of two um number of samples.|S|Bro024
me026|and um i'll i'll for the ones in between i guess i'll just zero pad.|S|Bro024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me013|i guess one thing that might also be an issue uh because part of what you're doing is you're getting a a spectrum over a bunch of different kinds of speech sounds.|S|Bro024
me013|um|F|Bro024
me013|and so it might matter how fast someone was talking for instance.|S|Bro024
me026|oh.|S|Bro024
me013|you know if you if if if there's a lot of phones in one second maybe you'll get a a really good sampling of all these different things.|S|Bro024
me013|and and uh on the other hand if someone's talking slowly maybe you'd need more.|S|Bro024
me013|so|F|Bro024
me013|i don't know if you have some samples of faster or slower speech.|S|Bro024
me026|huh.|B|Bro024
me013|but it might make a difference.|S|Bro024
me013|i don't know.|S|Bro024
me026|uh yeah.|S|Bro024
me026|i don't i don't think the t.i. digits data that i have um is would be appropriate for that.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah probably not.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me026|but what do you what about if i i fed it through some kind of um speech processing algorithm that changed the speech rate?|Q|Bro024
me013|yeah but then you'll have the degradation of of uh whatever you do uh added onto that.|S|Bro024
me013|but maybe.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|maybe if you get something that sounds that that's does a pretty job at that.|S|Bro024
me026|yeah.|S|Bro024
me026|well uh just if you think it's worth looking into.|S|Bro024
me013|you could imagine that.|S|Bro024
me026|i mean it it is getting a little away from reverberation.|S|Bro024
me013|um yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|it's just that you're making a choice.|S|Bro024
me013|uh i was thinking more from the system aspect if you're making a choice for smartkom that that that it might be that it's it the optimal number could be different depending on|D|Bro024
me026|yeah.|B|Bro024
me026|right.|S|Bro024
me013|could be.|S|Bro024
me013|i don't know.|D|Bro024
me026|and and the third thing um uh is um barry explained l.d.a. filtering to me yesterday.|S|Bro024
me026|and so um mike shire in his thesis um did a a series of experiments um training l.d.a. filters in on different conditions.|S|Bro024
me026|and you were interested in having me repeat this for|D|Bro024
me026|for this mean subtraction approach?|Q|Bro024
me026|is is that right?|Q|Bro024
me026|or for these long analysis windows i guess is the right way to put it.|S|Bro024
me013|i guess the the the issue i was the general issue i was bringing up was that if you're have a moving moving window uh a a a set of weights times things that uh move along shift along in time that you have in fact a linear time invariant filter.|S|Bro024
me013|and you just happened to have picked a particular one by setting all the weights to be equal.|S|Bro024
me013|and so the issue is what are some other filters that you could use uh in that sense of filter.|S|Bro024
me026|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me013|and um|F|Bro024
me013|as i was saying i think the simplest thing to do is not to train anything but just to do some sort of uh uh hamming or hanning uh kind of window kind of thing.|S|Bro024
me026|right.|S|Bro024
me026|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
me013|just sort of to de emphasize the jarring.|S|Bro024
me013|so i think that would sort of be the first thing to do.|S|Bro024
me013|but then yeah the l.d.a. uh is interesting because it would sort of say well suppose you actually trained this up to do the best you could by some criterion.|S|Bro024
me013|what would the filter look like then?|Q|Bro024
me026|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me013|uh|F|Bro024
me013|and um|F|Bro024
me013|that's sort of what we're doing in this aurora stuff.|S|Bro024
me013|and uh|F|Bro024
me013|it's still not clear to me in the long run whether the best thing to do would be to do that or to have some stylized version of the filter that looks like these things you've trained up because you always have the problem that it's trained up for one condition and it isn't quite right for another.|S|Bro024
me013|so|F|Bro024
me013|uh that's that's why that's why rasta filter has actually ended up lasting a long time.|S|Bro024
me013|people still using it quite a bit because you don't change it.|S|Bro024
me013|so|F|Bro024
me013|doesn't get any worse.|S|Bro024
me013|uh|F|Bro024
me026|huh.|B|Bro024
me013|anyway.|F|Bro024
me026|okay.|F|Bro024
me026|so um|F|Bro024
me026|actually i was just thinking about what i was asking about earlier which is about having less than say twelve seconds in the smartkom system to do the mean subtraction.|S|Bro024
me026|you said in systems where you use cepstral mean subtraction they concatenate utterances.|S|Bro024
me026|and do you know how they address this issue of um testing versus training?|Q|Bro024
me026|can|D|Bro024
mn058|i think what they do is they do it always online.|S|Bro024
me013|go ahead.|D|Bro024
mn058|i mean that you just take what you have from the past.|S|Bro024
mn058|that you calculate the mean of this and subtract the mean.|S|Bro024
me026|okay.|S|Bro024
me026|um|F|Bro024
mn058|and then you can yeah you you can increase your window while you get while you are getting more samples.|S|Bro024
me026|okay.|S|Bro024
me026|um|F|Bro024
me026|and um so so in in that case what do they do when they're um performing the cepstral mean subtraction on the training data?|Q|Bro024
me026|so because you'd have hours and hours of training data.|S|Bro024
me026|so do they cut it off and start over?|Q|Bro024
me026|at intervals.|S|Bro024
me026|or|D|Bro024
mn058|so do you have uh you you mean you have files which are hours of hours long?|Q|Bro024
mn058|or|D|Bro024
me026|oh well no.|S|Bro024
me026|i guess not.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
me026|but|D|Bro024
mn058|i mean usually you have in the training set you have similar conditions.|S|Bro024
mn058|i mean file lengths are i guess the same order or in the same size as for test data or|D|Bro024
mn058|aren't they?|Q|Bro024
me026|okay.|S|Bro024
me026|but it's|D|Bro024
me026|okay.|S|Bro024
me026|so if someone's interacting with the system though uh morgan uh morgan said that you would tend to um chain utterances together.|S|Bro024
me026|um|F|Bro024
me013|well i think what i was i thought what i was saying was that um at any given point you are going to start off with what you had from before.|S|Bro024
me026|oh.|B|Bro024
me013|from|D|Bro024
me013|and so if you're splitting things up into utterances.|S|Bro024
me013|so for instance in a dialogue system where you're going to be asking uh you know for some information there's some initial something.|S|Bro024
me013|and you know the first time out you you might have some general average.|S|Bro024
me013|but you you you don't have very much information yet.|S|Bro024
me013|but at after they've given one utterance you've got something.|S|Bro024
me013|you can compute your mean cepstra from that.|S|Bro024
me026|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me013|and then can use it for the next thing that they say.|S|Bro024
me013|uh|F|Bro024
me013|so that you know the performance should be better that second time.|S|Bro024
me013|um|F|Bro024
me013|and i think the heuristics of exactly how people handle that and how they handle their training i'm sure vary from place to place.|S|Bro024
me013|but i think the ideally it seems to me anyway that you you would want to do the same thing in training as you do in test.|S|Bro024
me013|but that's that's just uh a prejudice.|S|Bro024
me013|and i think anybody working on this with some particular task would experiment.|S|Bro024
me026|right.|S|Bro024
me026|i i guess the question i had was um amount of data was the amount of data that you'd give it to um update this estimate.|S|Bro024
me026|because say you if you have say five thousand utterances in your training set um and you you keep the mean from the last utterance.|S|Bro024
me026|by the time it gets to the five thousandth utterance|D|Bro024
me013|no but those are all different people with different i mean in|D|Bro024
me013|so for instance in in the in a telephone task these are different phone calls.|S|Bro024
me013|so you don't want to chain it together from a from a different phone call.|S|Bro024
me026|okay.|S|Bro024
me026|so so so they would|D|Bro024
me013|so it's within speaker.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|B|Bro024
me013|within phone call.|S|Bro024
me013|if it's a dialogue system it's within whatever this characteristic you're trying to get rid of is expected to be consistent over.|S|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
me026|and it|D|Bro024
me013|right?|Q|Bro024
me026|right.|S|Bro024
me026|okay.|S|Bro024
me026|so you'd you and so in training you would start over at at every new phone call or at every new speaker.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me026|yeah.|F|Bro024
me026|okay.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|now you know maybe you'd use something from the others.|S|Bro024
me013|just because at the beginning of a call you don't know anything.|S|Bro024
me013|and so you might have some kind of general thing that's your best guess to start with.|S|Bro024
me013|but|D|Bro024
me013|so i i|D|Bro024
me013|you know a lot of these things are proprietary.|S|Bro024
me013|so we're doing a little bit of guesswork here.|S|Bro024
me013|i mean what do what do people do who really face these problems in the field?|Q|Bro024
me013|well they have companies.|S|Bro024
me013|and they don't tell other people exactly what they do.|S|Bro024
me013|but but i mean when you the the hints that you get from what they when they talk about it are that they do they all do something like this.|S|Bro024
me026|right.|B|Bro024
me026|right.|S|Bro024
me026|okay.|S|Bro024
me026|i see.|S|Bro024
me026|because i so this smartkom task first off it's this t.v. and movie information system.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah but you might have somebody who's using it.|S|Bro024
me026|and|D|Bro024
me013|and then later you might have somebody else who's using it.|S|Bro024
me026|yeah.|B|Bro024
me026|yeah.|B|Bro024
me013|and so you'd want to set some|D|Bro024
me026|right.|S|Bro024
me026|right.|S|Bro024
me026|i i see.|S|Bro024
me026|i was i was about to say so if if you ask it what what movies are on t.v. tonight.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|B|Bro024
me026|if i look at my wristwatch when i say that it's about two seconds.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|B|Bro024
me026|the way i currently have the mean subtraction um set up the the analysis window is two seconds.|S|Bro024
me026|so what you just said about what do you start with raises a question of what do i start with then.|S|Bro024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me026|i guess it because|D|Bro024
me013|well.|F|Bro024
me013|okay.|S|Bro024
me013|so in that situation though maybe what's a little different there is i think you're talking about there's only one|D|Bro024
me013|it it it also depends|D|Bro024
me013|we're getting a little off track here.|S|Bro024
me026|oh.|S|Bro024
me013|but but but|F|Bro024
me026|right.|S|Bro024
me013|uh there's been some discussion about whether the work we're doing in that project is going to be for the kiosk or for the mobile or for both.|S|Bro024
me013|and i think for this kind of discussion it matters.|S|Bro024
me013|if it's in the kiosk then the physical situation is the same.|S|Bro024
me013|it's going to you know the exact interaction of the microphone's going to differ depending on the person and so forth.|S|Bro024
me013|but at least the basic acoustics are going to be the same.|S|Bro024
me013|so if it's really in one kiosk then i think that you could just chain together and and you know as much as much speech as possible to|D|Bro024
me013|because what you're really trying to get at is the is the reverberation characteristic.|S|Bro024
me026|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|but in in the case of the mobile uh presumably the acoustic's changing all over the place.|S|Bro024
me026|right.|S|Bro024
me013|and in that case you probably don't want to have it be endless because you want to have some sort of it's it's not a question of how long do you think it's you can get an approximation to a stationary something given that it's not really stationary.|S|Bro024
me026|right.|S|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
me026|right.|S|Bro024
me013|so|F|Bro024
me026|and i i i guess i just started thinking of another question.|S|Bro024
me026|which is for for the very first frame what what do i do.|S|Bro024
me026|if i'm if i take if i use that frame to calculate the mean then i'm just going to get nothing.|S|Bro024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me013|right.|S|Bro024
me026|um|F|Bro024
me026|so i should probably have some kind of default mean for the first couple of frames.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me026|okay.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|or subtract nothing.|S|Bro024
me013|i mean it's|D|Bro024
me026|or subtract nothing.|S|Bro024
me026|and and that's that's i guess that's something that's people have figured out how to deal with in cepstral mean subtraction as well?|Q|Bro024
me013|yeah yeah.|B|Bro024
me013|yeah people do something.|S|Bro024
me013|they they uh they have some um|D|Bro024
me013|uh|F|Bro024
me013|in in cepstral mean subtraction for short-term window analysis windows as is usually done you're trying to get rid of some very general characteristic.|S|Bro024
me013|and so uh if you have any other information about what a general kind of characteristic would be then you you can do it there.|S|Bro024
me018|you can also|D|Bro024
me018|you can also reflect the data.|S|Bro024
me018|so you take uh|D|Bro024
me018|you know.|F|Bro024
me018|i'm not sure how many frames you need.|S|Bro024
me018|but you take that many from the front and flip it around to as the negative value.|S|Bro024
me026|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|that's|D|Bro024
me018|so you can always|D|Bro024
me013|yeah.|B|Bro024
me013|the other thing is that and and i i remember b.b.n. doing this is that if you have a multi pass system um if the first pass it takes most of the computation the second and the third pass could be very very quick.|S|Bro024
me013|just looking at a relatively small small uh space of hypotheses.|S|Bro024
me026|huh.|B|Bro024
me026|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me013|then you can do your first pass without any subtraction at all.|S|Bro024
me026|oh.|B|Bro024
me013|and then your second pass uh uh eliminates those most of those hypotheses by uh by having an improved improved version of the analysis.|S|Bro024
me026|okay.|B|Bro024
me026|okay.|S|Bro024
me013|so|F|Bro024
me026|okay.|B|Bro024
me026|so that was all i had for now.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me018|do you want to go barry?|Q|Bro024
me006|yeah.|S|Bro024
me006|okay.|S|Bro024
me006|um so for the past uh week or two i've been just writing my uh formal thesis proposal.|S|Bro024
me006|um so i'm taking this qualifier exam that's coming up in two weeks.|S|Bro024
me006|and i i finish writing a proposal and submit it to the committee.|S|Bro024
me006|um|F|Bro024
me006|and uh should i should i explain uh more about what what i'm proposing to do and and stuff?|Q|Bro024
me013|yes briefly.|S|Bro024
me018|yeah briefly.|S|Bro024
me006|okay.|S|Bro024
me006|um|F|Bro024
me006|so briefly i'm proposing to do a a new approach to speech recognition using um a combination of uh multi band ideas and ideas um about the uh acoustic phonetic approach to speech recognition.|S|Bro024
me006|um so i will be using these graphical models that um that implement the multi band approach to recognize a set of intermediate categories that might involve uh things like phonetic features or other other feature things that are more closely related to the acoustic signal itself.|S|Bro024
me006|um and the hope in all of this is that by going multi band and by going into these um intermediate classifications that we can get a system that's more robust to to unseen noises and situations like that.|S|Bro024
me006|um|F|Bro024
me006|and so|F|Bro024
me006|some of the research issues involved in this are um one what kind of intermediate categories do we need to classify.|S|Bro024
me006|um another one is um what what other types of structures in these multi band graphical models should we consider in order to um combine evidence from the sub bands.|S|Bro024
me006|and uh the third one is how do we how do we merge all the uh information from the individual uh multi band classifiers to come up with word word recognition or or phone recognition things.|S|Bro024
me006|um|F|Bro024
me006|so basically that's that's what i've been doing.|S|Bro024
me018|so you've got two weeks huh?|S|Bro024
me006|and|F|Bro024
me006|i got two weeks to brush up on um presentation stuff.|S|Bro024
me006|and um|F|Bro024
me013|oh i thought you were finishing your thesis in two weeks.|S|Bro024
me006|but|F|Bro024
me006|oh that too.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me006|yeah.|D|Bro024
me018|are you going to do any dry runs for your thing?|Q|Bro024
me018|or are you just going to|D|Bro024
me006|yes.|S|Bro024
me006|yes.|S|Bro024
me006|i um i'm i'm going to do some.|S|Bro024
me006|would you be interested?|Q|Bro024
me018|sure.|S|Bro024
me006|to help out.|S|Bro024
me018|sure.|S|Bro024
me006|okay.|S|Bro024
me006|thanks.|S|Bro024
me006|yeah.|F|Bro024
me018|is that it?|Q|Bro024
me006|that's it.|S|Bro024
me018|okay.|S|Bro024
me018|uh hhh.|F|Bro024
me018|let's see.|F|Bro024
me018|so we've got forty minutes left.|S|Bro024
me018|and it seems like there's a lot of material.|S|Bro024
me018|any suggestions about where we where we should go next?|Q|Bro024
mn052|huh.|B|Bro024
me018|uh|F|Bro024
me018|do you want to go sunil?|Q|Bro024
me018|maybe we'll just start with you.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|but i actually stuck most of this in our last meeting with guenter.|S|Bro024
mn052|um|F|Bro024
mn052|but i'll just|D|Bro024
mn052|um|F|Bro024
mn052|so the last week uh i showed some results with only speechdat-car.|S|Bro024
mn052|which was like some fifty six percent.|S|Bro024
mn052|and uh i didn't|D|Bro024
mn052|i mean i i found that the results|D|Bro024
mn052|i mean i wasn't getting that results on the t.i. digit.|S|Bro024
mn052|so i was like looking into why what is wrong with the t.i. digits.|S|Bro024
mn052|why why i was not getting it.|S|Bro024
mn052|and i found that the noise estimation is a reason for the t.i. digits to perform worse than the baseline.|S|Bro024
mn052|so uh i actually picked|D|Bro024
mn052|i mean the first thing i did was i just scaled the noise estimate by a factor which is less than one to see if that because i found there are a lot of zeros in the spectrogram for the t.i. digits when i used this approach.|S|Bro024
mn052|so the first thing i did was i just scaled the noise estimate.|S|Bro024
mn052|and i found|D|Bro024
mn052|so the the results that i've shown here are the complete results using the new|D|Bro024
mn052|well the the new technique is nothing but the noise estimate scaled by a factor of point five.|S|Bro024
mn052|so it's just an ad hoc.|S|Bro024
mn052|i mean some intermediate result because it's not optimized for anything.|S|Bro024
mn052|so the results the trend the only trend i could see from those results was like the the the current noise estimation or the uh noise composition scheme is working good for like the car noise type of thing.|S|Bro024
mn052|because i've the only only very good result in the t.i. digits is the noise car noise condition for their test a..|S|Bro024
mn052|which is like the best i could see that|D|Bro024
mn052|uh for any non stationary noise like babble or subway or any street some restaurant noise it's like it's not performing very well.|S|Bro024
mn052|so|F|Bro024
mn052|the so that that's the first thing i uh i could make out from this stuff.|S|Bro024
mn052|and|F|Bro024
mn058|yeah i think what is important to see is that there is a big difference between the training modes.|S|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|F|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|if you have clean training you get also a fifty percent improvement.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn058|but if you have muddy condition training you get only twenty percent.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|F|Bro024
mn052|uh and in that twenty percent it's very inconsistent across different noise conditions.|S|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
mn052|so i have like a forty five percent for car noise.|S|Bro024
mn052|and then there's a minus five percent for the babble.|S|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
mn052|and there's this thirty three for the station.|S|Bro024
mn052|and so it's it's not it's not actually very consistent across.|S|Bro024
mn052|so|F|Bro024
mn052|the only correlation between the speechdat-car and this performance is the stationarity of the noise that is there in these conditions and the speechdat-car.|S|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn052|and uh|F|Bro024
mn052|so|F|Bro024
mn052|so the overall result is like in the last page.|S|Bro024
mn052|which is like forty seven.|S|Bro024
mn052|which is still very imbalanced because there are like fifty six percent on the speechdat-car and thirty five percent on the t.i. digits.|S|Bro024
mn052|and|F|Bro024
mn052|uh|F|Bro024
mn052|the fifty six percent is like comparable to what the french telecom gets.|S|Bro024
mn052|but the thirty five percent is way off.|S|Bro024
me013|i'm sort of confused.|S|Bro024
me013|but|F|Bro024
me013|this|D|Bro024
me013|i'm looking on the second page.|S|Bro024
mn052|oh.|S|Bro024
mn052|yep.|S|Bro024
me013|and it says fifty percent.|S|Bro024
me013|looking in the lower right-hand corner.|S|Bro024
me013|fifty percent relative performance.|S|Bro024
mn058|for the clean training.|S|Bro024
me013|is that|D|Bro024
mn058|and if you if you look|D|Bro024
me013|is that fifty percent improvement?|Q|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|for that's for the clean training and the noisy testing for the t.i. digits.|S|Bro024
me013|so it's improvement over the baseline mel cepstrum.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|but the baseline mel cepstrum under those training doesn't do as well.|S|Bro024
me013|i i'm i'm trying to understand why it's it's eighty percent.|S|Bro024
me013|that's an accuracy number i guess.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah yeah yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|right?|Q|Bro024
me013|so that's not as good as the one up above.|S|Bro024
mn052|no.|S|Bro024
me013|but the fifty is better than the one up above.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|so i'm confused.|S|Bro024
mn052|uh actually the noise compensation whatever uh we are put in it works very well for the high mismatch condition.|S|Bro024
mn052|i mean it's consistent in the speechdat-car.|S|Bro024
mn052|and in the clean training also it gives it|D|Bro024
mn052|but this fifty percent is is that the the high mismatch performance equivalent to the high mismatch performance in the speech.|S|Bro024
me018|so so since the high mismatch performance is much worse to begin with it's easier to get a better relative improvement.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn052|i do.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah yeah.|B|Bro024
mn052|so by putting this noise.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn007|yeah if we look at the figures on the right we see that the reference system is very bad.|S|Bro024
me013|oh.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|D|Bro024
mn052|the reference drops like a very fast.|S|Bro024
me013|oh oh oh oh oh oh.|S|Bro024
mn007|like for clean clean training condition.|S|Bro024
me013|i see.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
me013|i see.|S|Bro024
mn007|nnn.|F|Bro024
me013|this is this is t.i. digits we're looking at?|Q|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|this whole page is t.i. digits?|Q|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|oh.|S|Bro024
me013|or this is|D|Bro024
mn052|oh yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|it's not written anywhere.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah it's t.i. digits.|S|Bro024
mn052|the first spreadsheet is t.i. digits.|S|Bro024
me013|huh.|B|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
me013|how does clean training do for the uh car?|Q|Bro024
me013|stuff?|D|Bro024
mn052|the car?|Q|Bro024
mn052|oh.|S|Bro024
mn052|still it still uh that that's still consistent.|S|Bro024
mn052|i mean i get the best performance in the case of car which is the third column in the a. condition.|S|Bro024
me013|no.|S|Bro024
me013|i mean this is added noise.|S|Bro024
me013|i mean this is t.i. digits.|S|Bro024
me013|i'm sorry.|S|Bro024
me013|i meant in in the in the uh multi language uh uh finnish and|D|Bro024
mn052|uh|F|Bro024
mn058|this is next next page.|S|Bro024
mn052|that's the next next spreadsheet is.|S|Bro024
mn058|huh.|F|Bro024
mn052|so that is the performance for italian finnish and spanish.|S|Bro024
me013|training condition.|S|Bro024
me013|oh right.|S|Bro024
me013|so clean corresponds to high mismatch.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
me013|and increase|D|Bro024
me013|that's increase|D|Bro024
mn058|improvement.|S|Bro024
mn052|improvement.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn052|that's percentage increase is the percentage improvement over the baseline.|S|Bro024
mn058|it's it's a|D|Bro024
mn052|so that's|D|Bro024
me013|which means decrease in word error rate?|Q|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|okay.|S|Bro024
me013|so percentage increase means decrease.|S|Bro024
me013|okay.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|the the there was a very long discussion about this on on the on the uh amsterdam meeting.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn058|how to how to calculate it then.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|there's there's a|D|Bro024
mn058|i i i guess you are using finally this the scheme which they|D|Bro024
mn052|which is there in the spreadsheet.|S|Bro024
mn052|i'm not changing anything in there.|S|Bro024
mn058|okay.|B|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
me013|all right.|S|Bro024
mn052|so|F|Bro024
mn052|uh|F|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn052|so all the h.m. numbers are very good.|S|Bro024
mn052|in the sense they are better than what the french telecom gets.|S|Bro024
mn052|so|F|Bro024
mn052|but the the only number that's still i mean which stephane also got in his result was that medium mismatch of the finnish.|S|Bro024
mn052|which is very which is a very strange situation where we used the we changed the proto for initializing the h.m.m.|S|Bro024
mn052|i mean this this is basically because it gets stuck in some local minimum in the training.|S|Bro024
mn052|that seventy five point seven nine in the finnish mismatch which is that the eleven point nine six what we see.|S|Bro024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|F|Bro024
me013|so we have to jiggle it somehow?|Q|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|so we start with that different proto and it becomes eighty eight.|S|Bro024
mn052|which is like some fifty percent improvement.|S|Bro024
me013|wait a minute.|S|Bro024
me013|start with a different what?|Q|Bro024
mn052|different prototype.|S|Bro024
mn052|which is like a different initialization for the uh transition probabilities.|S|Bro024
mn052|it's just that right now the initialization is to stay more in the current state.|S|Bro024
mn052|which is point four point six right?|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|and if it changes to point five point five which is equal for transition and self loop where it becomes eighty eight percent.|S|Bro024
me018|well but that involves mucking with the back end.|S|Bro024
me018|which is not allowed.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|we can't do it.|S|Bro024
me018|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn007|huh.|B|Bro024
mn052|so|F|Bro024
mn058|i mean it uh like|D|Bro024
mn058|it is well known this this medium match condition of the finnish data has some strange effects.|S|Bro024
mn052|very|D|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn052|it has a very few at uh actually uh i mean words also.|S|Bro024
mn058|i mean that is|D|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|that too.|S|Bro024
mn052|it's a very very small set actually.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn058|there is a a there is a lot of uh there are a lot of utterances with music in with music in the background.|S|Bro024
mn052|so there is|D|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah yeah yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|huh.|F|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|it has some music also.|S|Bro024
mn052|i mean very horrible music like like 4x.|S|Bro024
mn052|i know.|S|Bro024
me013|so maybe for that one you need a much smarter v.a. d?|Q|Bro024
me013|huh|F|Bro024
me013|if it's music.|S|Bro024
mn052|uh|F|Bro024
mn052|so|F|Bro024
mn052|that that's the that's about the results.|S|Bro024
mn052|and uh|F|Bro024
mn052|the summary is like|D|Bro024
mn052|okay.|F|Bro024
mn052|so there are the other thing what i tried was which i explained in the last meeting is using the channel zero for uh for both dropping and estimating the noise.|S|Bro024
mn052|and that's like just to get a feel of how good it is.|S|Bro024
mn052|i guess the fifty six percent improvement in the speechdat-car becomes like sixty seven percent.|S|Bro024
mn052|like ten percent better.|S|Bro024
mn052|but that's that's not a that's a cheating experiment.|S|Bro024
mn052|so|F|Bro024
mn052|that's just|D|Bro024
mn052|so|F|Bro024
mn058|but the but the uh forty seven point nine percent which you have now that's already a remarkable improvement in comparison to the first proposal.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|so we had forty four percent in the first proposal.|S|Bro024
mn058|okay.|B|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|we have a big|D|Bro024
mn052|so the major improvement that we got was in all the high mismatch cases.|S|Bro024
mn052|because all those numbers were in sixties and seventies.|S|Bro024
mn052|because we never had any noise compensations.|S|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
mn052|so that's where the biggest improvement came up.|S|Bro024
mn052|not much in the well match and the medium match and t.i. digits also right now.|S|Bro024
mn052|so this is still at three or four percent improvement over the first proposal.|S|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
me013|yeah so that's good.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn052|so|F|Bro024
me013|then if we can improve the noise estimation then it should get better.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|i i started thinking about also|D|Bro024
mn058|i mean yeah uh i discovered the same problem when i started working on uh on this aurora task almost two years ago.|S|Bro024
mn058|that you have the problem with this|D|Bro024
mn058|at the beginning we had only this condition training of the t.i. digits.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn058|and uh i i found the same problem.|S|Bro024
mn058|just taking um what we were used to use i mean uh some type of spectral subtraction you get even worse results than the basis.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|D|Bro024
mn058|and uh|F|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|D|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|D|Bro024
mn058|i i tried to find an explanation for it.|S|Bro024
mn058|so|F|Bro024
me013|huh.|B|Bro024
mn052|so|F|Bro024
mn052|yes.|S|Bro024
mn052|stephane also has the same experience of using the spectral subtraction right?|S|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|so here here i mean i found that it's if i changed the noise estimate i could get an improvement.|S|Bro024
mn052|so that's so it's something which i can actually pursue is the noise estimate.|S|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn052|and|F|Bro024
mn058|yeah i think what you do is in when when you have the the this multi condition training mode um then you have then you can train models for the speech for the words as well as for the pauses where you really have all information about the noise available.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn058|and|F|Bro024
mn058|it was surprising.|S|Bro024
mn058|at the beginning it was not surprising to me that you get really the best results on doing it this way.|S|Bro024
mn058|i mean in comparison to any type of training on clean data and any type of processing.|S|Bro024
mn058|but it was|D|Bro024
mn058|so|F|Bro024
mn058|it it seems to be the best what what what we can do in this moment is multi condition training.|S|Bro024
mn058|and when we now start introducing some some noise reduction technique we we introduce also somehow artificial distortions.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn058|and these artificial distortions uh i have the feeling that they are the reason why why we have the problems in this multi condition training.|S|Bro024
mn058|that means the h.m.m.'s we trained they are they are based on gaussians.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn058|and on modeling gaussians.|S|Bro024
mn058|and if you|D|Bro024
mn058|can i move a little bit with this?|Q|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|and if we introduce now this this spectral subtraction or wiener filtering stuff|D|Bro024
mn058|so usually what you have is maybe um|D|Bro024
mn058|i'm i'm showing now an envelope.|S|Bro024
mn058|um|F|Bro024
mn058|maybe you'll for this time.|S|Bro024
mn058|so usually you have maybe in clean condition you have something which looks like this.|S|Bro024
mn058|and if it is noisy it is somewhere here.|S|Bro024
mn058|and then you try to subtract it or wiener filter or whatever.|S|Bro024
mn058|and what you get is you have always these problems that you have this these these these zeros in there.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn058|and you have to do something if you get these negative values.|S|Bro024
mn058|i mean this is your noise estimate and you somehow subtract it or do whatever.|S|Bro024
mn058|uh and then you have|D|Bro024
mn058|and then i think what you do is you introduce some some artificial distribution in this.|S|Bro024
mn058|uh|F|Bro024
mn058|in in the models.|S|Bro024
mn058|i mean you you train it also this way.|S|Bro024
mn058|but somehow there is there is no longer a a gaussian distribution.|S|Bro024
mn058|it is somehow a strange distribution which we introduce with these artificial distortions.|S|Bro024
mn058|and and i was thinking that that might be the reason why you get these problems in the especially in the multi condition training mode.|S|Bro024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn052|yeah yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|the the models are not complex enough to absorb that additional variability that you're introducing.|S|Bro024
me018|thanks adam.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|yes.|S|Bro024
mn052|well that's|D|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn052|so|F|Bro024
mn007|i also have the feeling that um the reason why it doesn't work is yeah that the models are much are um not complex enough.|S|Bro024
mn007|because i actually i always had a good experience with spectral subtraction.|S|Bro024
mn007|just a straight spectral subtraction algorithm when i was using neural networks big neural networks which maybe are more able to model strange distributions.|S|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn007|and|F|Bro024
mn007|but|F|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn007|then i tried the same exactly the same spectral subtraction algorithm on these aurora tasks.|S|Bro024
mn007|and it simply doesn't work.|S|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
mn007|it's even it uh hurts even.|S|Bro024
mn007|so|F|Bro024
me013|we probably should at some point here try the tandem the the the system two kind of stuff with this with the spectral subtraction for that reason.|S|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me013|because again it should do a transformation to a domain where it maybe looks more gaussian.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn058|i i was|D|Bro024
mn058|just yesterday when i was thinking about it um what what we could try to do or do about it|D|Bro024
mn058|i mean if you if you get at this in this situation that you get this this negative values and you simply set it to zero or to a constant or whatever if we if we would use there a somehow um a random generator which which has a certain distribution not a certain yeah a special distribution we should see we we have to think about it.|S|Bro024
mn052|it's|D|Bro024
mn058|and that we so introduce again some natural behavior in this trajectory.|S|Bro024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn052|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn052|very different from speech.|S|Bro024
mn052|still i mean it shouldn't confuse the|D|Bro024
mn058|yeah i mean similar to what what you see really in in the real um noisy situation.|S|Bro024
mn052|okay.|S|Bro024
mn052|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn058|or in the clean situation.|S|Bro024
mn058|but but somehow a a natural distribution.|S|Bro024
me013|but isn't that again sort of the idea of the additive thing?|Q|Bro024
me013|if it as as we had in the j. stuff.|S|Bro024
me013|i mean basically if if you have random data um in in the time domain then when you look at the spectrum it's going to be pretty flat.|S|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me013|and and|F|Bro024
me013|uh|F|Bro024
me013|so just add something everywhere rather than just in those places.|S|Bro024
me013|it's just a constant right?|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|i think|D|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn058|it's it's just especially in these segments.|S|Bro024
mn058|i mean you introduce um very artificial behavior.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn058|and|F|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|well see if you add something everywhere it has almost no effect up up up on on top.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me013|and it and it and it has significant effect down there.|S|Bro024
me013|that was sort of the idea.|S|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn052|huh.|B|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|the that's true.|S|Bro024
mn052|that those those regions are the cause for this those negative values or whatever you get.|S|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn052|so|F|Bro024
mn058|i mean we we could uh we we could think how what what we could try.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn058|i mean it it was just an idea.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn058|i mean we|D|Bro024
me013|i think when it's noisy people should just speak up.|S|Bro024
mn058|to|D|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
mn052|so|D|Bro024
mn007|if we look at the france telecom proposal they use some kind of noise addition.|S|Bro024
mn007|they have a random number generator right?|S|Bro024
mn007|and they add noise on the trajectory of uh the log energy only right?|S|Bro024
me013|oh they do.|S|Bro024
me013|oh.|B|Bro024
mn052|yep.|S|Bro024
mn052|c.c. zero and log energy also.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn007|but i don't know how much effect it this have.|S|Bro024
mn007|but they do that.|S|Bro024
mn052|now?|Q|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn052|oh.|B|Bro024
me013|huh.|B|Bro024
mn058|so it it it it it is somehow similar to what|D|Bro024
mn007|i think because they have log energy.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|and then just generate random number.|S|Bro024
mn007|they have some kind of mean and variance.|S|Bro024
mn007|and they add this number to to the log energy simply.|S|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
me013|to the|D|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|the the log energy the after the clean cleaning up.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn052|so they add a random random noise to it.|S|Bro024
me013|to the just the energy or to the mel uh to the mel filter?|Q|Bro024
mn052|no.|S|Bro024
mn052|only to the log energy.|S|Bro024
mn007|only|D|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|oh.|S|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me013|so it because i mean i think this is most interesting for the mel filters.|S|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me013|right?|Q|Bro024
me013|or or f.f.t.'s.|S|Bro024
me013|one or the other.|S|Bro024
mn058|but but they do not apply filtering of the log energy or what|D|Bro024
mn052|like uh i mean|D|Bro024
mn058|like like a spectral subtraction.|S|Bro024
mn058|or|F|Bro024
mn052|no their filter is not m. domain.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|so they did filter their time signal.|S|Bro024
mn058|i|D|Bro024
mn052|and then what|D|Bro024
mn058|and then they calculate from this the log energy.|S|Bro024
mn058|or|F|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|then after that it is almost the same as the baseline system.|S|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn052|and then the final log energy that they that they get that to the to that they add some random noise.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah but again that's just log energy as opposed to filter bank energy.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
mn052|so it's not the mel.|S|Bro024
mn052|you know it's not the mel filter bank output.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn052|these are log energy computed from the time domain signal.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn052|not from the mel filter banks.|S|Bro024
mn052|so|F|Bro024
me013|huh.|B|Bro024
mn007|maybe it's just a way to decrease the importance of this particular parameter in the in the world feature vector.|S|Bro024
mn052|did|D|Bro024
mn007|if you add noise to one of the parameters you widen the distributions.|S|Bro024
me013|huh.|B|Bro024
mn052|becomes flat.|S|Bro024
mn052|the variance yeah reduces.|S|Bro024
mn007|and|D|Bro024
mn052|so|F|Bro024
mn052|huh yeah.|F|Bro024
mn007|eee-sss-uh.|D|Bro024
me013|so it could reduce the dependence on the amplitude and so on.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah?|Q|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn052|although|D|Bro024
me013|maybe.|S|Bro024
me018|so is uh is that about it?|Q|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn052|uh|F|Bro024
me018|or|D|Bro024
mn052|so the|D|Bro024
mn052|okay.|S|Bro024
mn052|so the other thing is the i'm just looking at a little bit on the delay issue where the delay of the system is like a hundred and eighty millisecond.|S|Bro024
mn052|so i just just tried another system i mean another filter which i've like shown at the end.|S|Bro024
mn052|which is very similar to the existing uh filter.|S|Bro024
mn052|only uh only thing is that the phase is is like a totally nonlinear phase.|S|Bro024
mn052|because it's a it's not a symmetric filter anymore.|S|Bro024
me018|this is for the l.d. a?|Q|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|so so this this is like so this makes the delay like zero for l.d.a.|S|Bro024
mn052|because it's completely causal.|S|Bro024
me018|oh.|S|Bro024
mn052|so|F|Bro024
mn052|so i got actually just the results for the italian for that.|S|Bro024
mn052|and that's like|D|Bro024
mn052|so the fifty one point o. nine has become forty eight point o. six.|S|Bro024
mn052|which is like three percent relative degradation.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn052|so i have like the fifty one point o. nine.|S|Bro024
mn052|and|F|Bro024
mn052|so|F|Bro024
mn052|i don't know it fares for the other conditions.|S|Bro024
mn052|so it's just like it's like a three percent relative degradation.|S|Bro024
mn052|with the|D|Bro024
mn058|but but is there is there a problem with the one hundred eighty milliseconds?|Q|Bro024
mn058|or|D|Bro024
me013|well this is|D|Bro024
mn052|uh|D|Bro024
mn058|yeah i mean i talked to to uh i uh i talked uh about it with with hynek.|S|Bro024
mn058|i mean there is|D|Bro024
me013|this is|D|Bro024
me013|so so basically our our position is that um we shouldn't be unduly constraining the latency at this point.|S|Bro024
me013|because we're all still experimenting with trying to make the performance better in the presence of noise.|S|Bro024
me013|uh there is a minority in that group who is arguing who are arguing for um uh having a further constraining of the latency.|S|Bro024
me013|so we're just continuing to keep aware of what the tradeoffs are and you know what what do we gain from having longer or shorter latencies.|S|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
me013|but since we always seem to at least get something out of longer latencies not being so constrained we're tending to go with that if we're not told we can't do it.|S|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me018|what where was the um the smallest latency of all the systems last time?|Q|Bro024
mn052|the french telecom.|S|Bro024
me013|well france telecom was was was very short latency.|S|Bro024
mn058|it's|D|Bro024
me013|and they had a very good result.|S|Bro024
me018|what what was it?|Q|Bro024
me013|it was thirty five.|S|Bro024
mn058|it was in the order of thirty milliseconds.|S|Bro024
mn058|or|F|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me018|thirteen?|Q|Bro024
mn058|thirty.|S|Bro024
me018|thirty.|S|Bro024
mn052|thirty four.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah so it's possible to get very short latency.|S|Bro024
me013|but again we're the the approaches that we're using are ones that take advantage of|D|Bro024
me018|yeah.|B|Bro024
me018|i was just curious about where we are compared to you know the shortest that people have done.|S|Bro024
mn058|but but i think this thirty milliseconds they they did it did not include the the delta calculation.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|and this is included now.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|you know?|Q|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|so if they include the delta it will be an additional forty millisecond.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn058|i i don't remember the|D|Bro024
mn058|they were not using the h.t.k. delta?|Q|Bro024
mn052|no they're using a nine point window.|S|Bro024
mn052|which is like a four on either side.|S|Bro024
mn058|nine point.|S|Bro024
mn052|which is like|D|Bro024
mn058|okay.|S|Bro024
mn052|so.|F|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
mn052|they didn't include that.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn052|so|D|Bro024
me018|okay.|S|Bro024
mn007|where does the compression in decoding delay comes from?|Q|Bro024
mn052|that's the way the the the frames are packed.|S|Bro024
mn052|like you have to wait for one more frame to pack.|S|Bro024
mn052|because it's the c.r.c. is computed for two frames always.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me013|well that they would need that forty milliseconds also.|S|Bro024
me013|right?|Q|Bro024
mn052|no.|S|Bro024
mn052|they actually changed the compression scheme altogether.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn052|so they have their own compression and decoding scheme.|S|Bro024
mn052|and they i don't know what they have.|S|Bro024
me013|oh.|S|Bro024
mn052|but they have coded zero delay for that.|S|Bro024
mn052|because they i know they changed it.|S|Bro024
mn052|their compression.|S|Bro024
mn052|they have their own c.r.c.|S|Bro024
mn052|their their own error correction mechanism.|S|Bro024
me013|oh.|B|Bro024
mn052|so they don't have to wait more than one more frame to know whether the current frame is in error.|S|Bro024
me013|oh okay.|S|Bro024
mn052|so they changed the whole thing so that there's no delay for that compression and part also.|S|Bro024
me013|huh.|B|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn052|even you have reported actually zero delay for the compression.|S|Bro024
mn052|i thought maybe you also have some different|D|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
mn058|no i think i i used this scheme as it was before.|S|Bro024
mn052|okay.|B|Bro024
mn052|uh.|D|Bro024
mn052|uhhuh.|D|Bro024
me018|okay.|F|Bro024
me018|we've got twenty minutes.|S|Bro024
me018|so we should probably try to move along.|S|Bro024
me018|uh did you want to go next stephane?|Q|Bro024
mn007|i can go next.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|huh.|F|Bro024
me013|oh.|F|Bro024
mn007|it's|D|Bro024
me013|wait a minute.|S|Bro024
me013|it's|D|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|we have to take|D|Bro024
me013|wait a minute.|S|Bro024
me013|i think i'm confused.|S|Bro024
mn007|well.|F|Bro024
mn007|okay.|S|Bro024
me013|all right.|S|Bro024
mn007|so you have one sheet.|S|Bro024
mn007|this one is you don't need it.|S|Bro024
mn007|all right.|S|Bro024
me013|uh|F|Bro024
mn007|so you have to take the whole the five.|S|Bro024
mn007|there should be five sheets.|S|Bro024
me013|okay.|S|Bro024
me013|i have four now.|S|Bro024
me013|because i left one with dave because i thought i was dropping one off and passing the others on.|S|Bro024
me013|so no.|S|Bro024
me013|we're not.|S|Bro024
me013|okay.|S|Bro024
mn052|thanks.|S|Bro024
fn002|please give me one.|S|Bro024
me013|uh we need one more over here.|S|Bro024
mn007|okay maybe there's not enough for everybody.|S|Bro024
me018|i can share with barry.|S|Bro024
mn007|but|F|Bro024
me006|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn058|okay.|B|Bro024
me013|oh okay.|S|Bro024
mn007|can we look at this?|Q|Bro024
me026|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn007|so|F|Bro024
mn007|yeah there are two figures showing actually the huh um performance of the current v.a.d.|S|Bro024
mn007|so it's a neural network based on p.l.p. parameters.|S|Bro024
mn007|uh which estimate silence probabilities.|S|Bro024
mn007|and then i just put a median filtering on this.|S|Bro024
mn007|to smooth the probabilities right?|S|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn007|i didn't use the the scheme that's currently in the proposal.|S|Bro024
mn007|because i don't want to.|S|Bro024
mn007|in the proposal|D|Bro024
mn007|well in in the system we want to add like speech frame before every word and a little bit of of uh a couple of frames after also.|S|Bro024
mn007|uh but to estimate the performance of the v.a.d. we don't want to do that.|S|Bro024
mn007|because it would artificially increase the um the false alarm rate of speech detection.|S|Bro024
mn007|right?|Q|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn007|so|F|Bro024
mn007|there is normally a figure for the finnish and one for italian.|S|Bro024
mn007|and maybe someone has two for the italian.|S|Bro024
mn007|because i'm missing one figure here.|S|Bro024
mn052|no.|S|Bro024
mn007|well.|F|Bro024
mn007|well whatever.|S|Bro024
mn007|uh yeah so one surprising thing that we can notice first is that apparently the speech miss rate is uh higher than the false alarm rate.|S|Bro024
mn007|so|F|Bro024
mn058|so so what is the lower curve and the upper curve?|Q|Bro024
mn007|it means|D|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah there are two curves.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn007|one curve's for the close talking microphone which is the lower curve.|S|Bro024
mn058|uh okay.|S|Bro024
mn007|and the other one is for the distant microphone.|S|Bro024
mn007|which has more noise.|S|Bro024
mn007|so|F|Bro024
mn007|it's logical that it performs worse.|S|Bro024
mn007|so as i was saying the miss rate is quite important.|S|Bro024
mn007|uh which means that we tend to label speech as as a silence.|S|Bro024
mn007|and|F|Bro024
mn007|uh i didn't analyze further yet.|S|Bro024
mn007|but i think it's it may be due to the fricative sounds.|S|Bro024
mn007|which may be in noisy condition maybe label labelled as silence.|S|Bro024
mn007|and it may also be due to the alignment.|S|Bro024
mn007|because|D|Bro024
mn007|well the reference alignment.|S|Bro024
mn007|because right now i just use an alignment obtained from from a system trained on channel zero.|S|Bro024
mn007|and|F|Bro024
mn007|i checked it a little bit.|S|Bro024
mn007|but there might be alignment errors.|S|Bro024
mn007|um yeah.|F|Bro024
mn007|like the fact that the the models tend to align their first state on silence and their last state on silence also.|S|Bro024
mn007|so the reference reference alignment would label as speech some silence frame before speech and after speech.|S|Bro024
mn007|this is something that we already noticed before.|S|Bro024
mn007|when|D|Bro024
mn007|huh|F|Bro024
mn007|so this this could also explain uh the high miss rate maybe.|S|Bro024
mn058|and and this this curves are the average over the whole database.|S|Bro024
mn007|uh|F|Bro024
mn058|so|F|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|right.|S|Bro024
mn058|huh.|S|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|and the different points of the curves are for five uh thresholds on the probability uh from point three to point seven.|S|Bro024
mn052|so that threshold|D|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|F|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn052|okay.|S|Bro024
mn052|okay.|S|Bro024
mn052|so the detection threshold is very|D|Bro024
mn007|so the|D|Bro024
mn007|the v.a. d?|Q|Bro024
mn052|yeah yeah.|D|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|there first a threshold on the probability that puts all the values to zero or one.|S|Bro024
mn052|huh.|B|Bro024
mn007|and then the median filtering.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|so the median filtering is fixed.|S|Bro024
mn052|you just change the threshold.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|it's fixed.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn007|so going from channel zero to channel one uh almost double the error rate.|S|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn007|well so it's a reference performance that we can you know if we want to to work on the v.a.d. we can work on this basis.|S|Bro024
mn052|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn007|and|F|Bro024
mn052|okay.|S|Bro024
me006|is this is this v.a.d.a.m.l. p?|Q|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
me006|okay.|S|Bro024
me006|how how big is it?|Q|Bro024
mn007|it's a very big one.|S|Bro024
mn007|i don't remember.|S|Bro024
mn052|so three three hundred and fifty inputs.|S|Bro024
mn052|uh|F|Bro024
mn052|six thousand hidden nodes and two outputs.|S|Bro024
me006|okay.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me013|middle sized one.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn007|uh ppp|F|Bro024
mn007|i don't know you have questions about that or suggestions?|Q|Bro024
mn052|huh.|B|Bro024
mn052|so.|B|Bro024
mn007|it seems the performance seems worse in finnish.|S|Bro024
mn007|which|D|Bro024
mn052|well it's not trained on finnish.|S|Bro024
mn007|uh|F|Bro024
fn002|it's worse.|S|Bro024
mn007|it's not trained on finnish.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|what's it trained on?|Q|Bro024
mn052|i mean the m.l.p.'s not trained on finnish.|S|Bro024
me013|right.|S|Bro024
me013|what's it trained on?|Q|Bro024
mn052|oh oh.|S|Bro024
mn052|sorry.|S|Bro024
mn052|uh it's italian t.i. digits.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|B|Bro024
me013|oh it's trained on italian?|Q|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me013|okay.|S|Bro024
mn007|and|D|Bro024
mn052|that's right.|D|Bro024
me013|okay.|F|Bro024
mn007|and also there are like funny noises on finnish.|S|Bro024
mn007|more than on italian.|S|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn007|i mean like music.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn007|and um|F|Bro024
mn052|yeah the yeah it's true.|S|Bro024
mn007|so yeah.|F|Bro024
mn007|we were looking at this.|S|Bro024
mn007|but for most of the noises noises are|D|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn007|i don't know if we want to talk about that.|S|Bro024
mn007|but|F|Bro024
mn007|well the the car noises are below like five hundred hertz.|S|Bro024
mn007|and we were looking at the music utterances.|S|Bro024
mn007|and in this case the noise is more about two thousand hertz.|S|Bro024
mn007|well the music energy's very low apparently.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn007|uh|F|Bro024
mn007|uh from zero to two two thousand hertz.|S|Bro024
mn007|so maybe just looking at this frequency range for from five hundred to two thousand would improve somewhat the v.a.d.|S|Bro024
mn052|huh.|B|Bro024
mn007|and|F|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|huh.|F|Bro024
mn052|so there are like some some some parameters you wanted to use or something?|Q|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn007|but|F|Bro024
mn007|yes.|S|Bro024
mn052|or yeah.|F|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn007|uh the next|D|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn058|so is the is the is the training is the training based on these labels files which you take as reference here?|Q|Bro024
mn007|oh it's there.|S|Bro024
mn058|when you train the neural net you|D|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|no.|S|Bro024
mn007|it's not.|S|Bro024
mn007|it's it was trained on some alignment obtained|D|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn007|uh for the italian data i think we trained the neural network on with embedded training.|S|Bro024
mn007|so re estimation of the alignment using the neural network i guess.|S|Bro024
mn007|that's right?|Q|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|we actually trained uh the on the italian training part.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn052|we we had another system with|D|Bro024
mn007|so it was a a phonetic classification system for the italian aurora data.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|it must be somewhere.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn007|for the aurora data that it was trained on it was different.|S|Bro024
mn007|like for t.i. digits you used a a previous system that you had i guess.|S|Bro024
mn052|what|D|Bro024
mn052|no it|D|Bro024
mn052|yeah yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|that's true.|S|Bro024
mn007|so the alignments from the different database that are used for training came from different system.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn007|then we put them together.|S|Bro024
mn007|well you put them together and trained the v.a.d. on them.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn007|huh.|F|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
mn007|uh|F|Bro024
mn007|but did you use channel did you align channel one also?|Q|Bro024
mn007|or|D|Bro024
mn052|i just took their entire italian training part.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|so it was both channel zero plus channel one.|S|Bro024
mn007|so|D|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|so the alignments might be wrong then on channel one right?|S|Bro024
mn052|on one.|S|Bro024
mn052|possible.|S|Bro024
mn007|so we might|D|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn052|we can do a realignment.|S|Bro024
mn052|that's true.|S|Bro024
mn007|at least want to retrain on these alignments.|S|Bro024
mn007|which should be better because they come from close talking microphone.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|the that was my idea.|S|Bro024
mn058|i mean if if it if it is not the same labeling which is taking the spaces.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn007|okay.|B|Bro024
mn052|yeah possible.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|huh.|S|Bro024
mn052|i mean it|D|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn052|so the system|D|Bro024
mn052|so the v.a.d. was trained on maybe different set of labels for channel zero and channel one.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn052|and|F|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn052|was the alignments were were different for certainly different because they were independently trained.|S|Bro024
mn052|we didn't copy the channel zero alignments to channel one.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn052|but for the new alignments what you generated you just copied the channel zero to channel one right?|S|Bro024
mn007|right.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|D|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn007|and uh hhh|F|Bro024
mn007|actually when we look at at the v.a.d. for some utterances it's almost perfect.|S|Bro024
mn007|i mean it just dropped one frame.|S|Bro024
mn007|the first frame of speech.|S|Bro024
mn007|or|F|Bro024
mn007|so there are some utterances where it's almost one hundred percent v.a.d. performance.|S|Bro024
mn058|huh.|S|Bro024
mn007|uh|F|Bro024
mn007|but yeah.|F|Bro024
mn007|huh|F|Bro024
mn007|yep.|S|Bro024
mn007|so the next thing is um i have the spreadsheet for three different system.|S|Bro024
mn007|but for this you only have to look right now on the speechdat-car performance.|S|Bro024
mn007|uh because i didn't test|D|Bro024
mn007|so i didn't test the spectral subtraction on t.i. digits yet.|S|Bro024
mn007|uh so you have three sheets.|S|Bro024
mn007|one is the um proposal one system.|S|Bro024
mn007|actually it's not exactly proposal one.|S|Bro024
mn007|it's the system that sunil just described.|S|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn007|but with uh wiener filtering from um france telecom included.|S|Bro024
mn007|um so this gives like fifty seven point seven percent uh uh error rate reduction on the speechdat-car data.|S|Bro024
mn007|huh|F|Bro024
mn007|and then i have two sheets where it's for a system where|D|Bro024
mn007|uh|F|Bro024
mn007|so it's again the same system.|S|Bro024
mn007|but in this case we have spectral subtraction.|S|Bro024
mn007|with a maximum overestimation factor of two point five.|S|Bro024
mn007|uh there is smoothing of the gain trajectory with some kind of uh low pass filter.|S|Bro024
mn007|which has forty milliseconds latency.|S|Bro024
mn007|and then after subtraction um i add a constant to the energies.|S|Bro024
mn007|and i have two cases where the first case is where the constant is twenty five d.b. below the mean speech energy.|S|Bro024
mn007|and the other is thirty d.b. below.|S|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn007|and for these two system we have like fifty five point uh five percent improvement.|S|Bro024
mn007|and fifty eight point one.|S|Bro024
mn007|so again it's around fifty six fifty seven.|S|Bro024
mn007|uh|F|Bro024
me013|because i notice the t.i. digits number is exactly the same for these last two.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah because i didn't|D|Bro024
mn007|for the france telecom uh spectral subtraction included in the our system the t.i. digits number are the right one.|S|Bro024
mn007|but not for the other system.|S|Bro024
mn007|because i didn't test it yet this system including with spectral subtraction on the t.i. digits data.|S|Bro024
mn007|i just tested it on speechdat-car.|S|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
me013|uh!|S|Bro024
me013|so so that means the only thing|D|Bro024
mn058|so so so these numbers are simply|D|Bro024
mn007|this we have to|D|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn052|but this number.|S|Bro024
mn058|okay.|S|Bro024
mn007|yes.|S|Bro024
me013|so you so you just should look at that fifty eight point o. nine percent and so on.|S|Bro024
mn007|right.|S|Bro024
mn007|right.|D|Bro024
me013|okay.|S|Bro024
me013|good.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn052|so this|D|Bro024
mn052|so by uh by by reducing the noise a a decent threshold like minus thirty d.b. it's like uh you are like reducing the floor of the noisy regions right?|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|the floor is lower.|S|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn052|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|F|Bro024
me013|i'm sorry.|S|Bro024
me013|so when you say minus twenty five or minus thirty d.b. with respect to what?|Q|Bro024
mn007|to the average um speech energy.|S|Bro024
mn007|which is estimated on the world database.|S|Bro024
me013|okay.|S|Bro024
me013|so basically you're creating a signal to noise ratio of twenty five or thirty d.b.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|but it's not|D|Bro024
mn058|i i i think what you do is this.|S|Bro024
me013|uh|D|Bro024
mn007|it it's|D|Bro024
mn058|when when you have this after you subtracted it i mean then you get something with this uh where you set the values to zero.|S|Bro024
mn058|and then you simply add an additive constant again.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|so you shift it somehow.|S|Bro024
mn058|this this whole curve is shifted again.|S|Bro024
mn007|right.|S|Bro024
me013|but did you do that before the thresholding to zero?|Q|Bro024
mn007|it's|D|Bro024
me013|or|D|Bro024
mn007|but it's after the thresholding.|S|Bro024
mn007|so|F|Bro024
me013|oh.|S|Bro024
me013|so you'd really want to do it before.|S|Bro024
mn007|maybe|D|Bro024
me013|right?|Q|Bro024
mn007|maybe we might do it before.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|because then the then you would have less of that phenomenon.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|hhh.|D|Bro024
me013|i think.|S|Bro024
mn007|uh|F|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|but still when you do this and you take the log after that it it reduce the the variance.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|it it|D|Bro024
mn007|but|F|Bro024
me013|right.|S|Bro024
mn007|huh|F|Bro024
me013|yeah that will reduce the variance.|S|Bro024
me013|that'll help.|S|Bro024
me013|but maybe if you does do it before you get less of these funny looking things he's drawing.|S|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn052|so before it's like adding this to the to the original.|S|Bro024
mn058|but but|F|Bro024
mn007|we would|D|Bro024
me013|right at the point where you've done the subtraction.|S|Bro024
mn052|okay.|S|Bro024
me013|um essentially you're adding a constant into everything.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn058|but the way stephane did it it is exactly the way i have implemented in the phone.|S|Bro024
mn058|so|F|Bro024
me013|oh yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|better do it different then.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro024
me013|just you you just you just set it for a particular signal to noise ratio that you want.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah i i made similar investigations like stephane did here.|S|Bro024
mn058|just uh adding this constant and and looking how dependent is it on the value of the constant.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|B|Bro024
me013|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn058|and then must choose them somehow to give on average the best results for a certain range of the signal to noise ratios.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn058|so|F|Bro024
mn007|oh it's clear.|S|Bro024
mn007|i should have given other results.|S|Bro024
mn007|also it's clear when you don't add noise it's much worse.|S|Bro024
mn007|like around five percent worse i guess.|S|Bro024
me013|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn007|and if you add too much noise it get worse also.|S|Bro024
mn007|and it seems that right now this this is a constant that does not depend on on anything that you can learn from the utterance.|S|Bro024
mn007|it's just a constant noise addition.|S|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn007|and i i think|D|Bro024
me013|i i'm sorry.|S|Bro024
mn007|i think|D|Bro024
me013|then then i'm confused.|S|Bro024
me013|i thought|D|Bro024
me013|you're saying it doesn't depend on the utterance.|S|Bro024
me013|but i thought you were adding an amount that was twenty five d.b. down from the signal energy.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|so the way i did that i just measured the average speech energy of the all the italian data.|S|Bro024
me013|oh!|S|Bro024
mn007|and then i i have i used this as mean speech energy.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|F|Bro024
me013|oh it's just a constant amount over all.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn007|and|F|Bro024
mn007|what i observed is that for italian and spanish when you go to thirty and twenty five d.b. uh it it's good.|S|Bro024
mn052|okay.|S|Bro024
mn052|oh.|S|Bro024
mn007|it stays in this range.|S|Bro024
mn007|it's uh the|D|Bro024
mn007|well the performance of the this algorithm is quite good.|S|Bro024
mn007|but for finnish you have a degradation already when you go from thirty five to thirty.|S|Bro024
mn007|and then from thirty to twenty five.|S|Bro024
mn007|and i have the feeling that maybe it's because just finnish has a mean energy that's lower than than the other databases.|S|Bro024
mn007|and due to this the thresholds should be|D|Bro024
me013|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn007|the the the noise addition should be lower.|S|Bro024
me013|but in i mean in the real thing you're not going to be able to measure what people are doing over half an hour or an hour or anything right?|S|Bro024
mn007|and|D|Bro024
me013|so you have to come up with this number from something else.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|so|F|Bro024
mn058|uh but you are not doing it now language dependent?|Q|Bro024
mn058|or|D|Bro024
mn007|it's not.|S|Bro024
mn007|it's just something that's fixed.|S|Bro024
mn058|no.|S|Bro024
mn058|it's overall.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|okay.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn007|yeah so i|D|Bro024
me013|but what he is doing language dependent is measuring what that number reference is that he comes down twenty five down from.|S|Bro024
mn007|no.|S|Bro024
mn007|it no.|S|Bro024
mn007|because i did it i started working on italian.|S|Bro024
me013|no?|Q|Bro024
mn007|i obtained this average energy.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|and then i used this one.|S|Bro024
mn052|for all the languages.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|okay.|S|Bro024
me013|so it's sort of arbitrary.|S|Bro024
me013|i mean so if if|D|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
me013|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn007|yep.|S|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
me013|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn007|yeah so the next thing is to use this as as maybe initialization.|S|Bro024
mn007|and then use something online.|S|Bro024
me013|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
me013|something more adaptive.|S|Bro024
mn007|but and i expect improvement at least in finnish because uh the way|D|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|okay.|B|Bro024
mn007|well.|F|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn007|for italian and spanish it's this value works good but not necessarily for finnish.|S|Bro024
mn007|huh|F|Bro024
mn007|but unfortunately there is like this forty millisecond latency.|S|Bro024
mn007|and|F|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn007|yeah so i would try to somewhat reduce this.|S|Bro024
mn007|i already know that if i completely remove this latency so um it um there is a three percent hit on italian.|S|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn052|does latency|D|Bro024
mn052|sorry.|S|Bro024
mn052|go ahead.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|your your smoothing was uh over this so to say the the factor of the wiener.|S|Bro024
mn058|and then it's uh|D|Bro024
mn058|what was it?|Q|Bro024
mn058|this|D|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn058|this smoothing it was over the subtraction factor so to say.|S|Bro024
mn007|it's a smoothing over the the gain of the subtraction algorithm.|S|Bro024
mn058|was this done|D|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn058|and and you are looking into the future into the past.|S|Bro024
mn007|right.|S|Bro024
mn058|and smoothing.|S|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn007|so to smooth this thing.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn058|and did did you try simply to smooth um to smooth the the to to smooth stronger the the envelope?|Q|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn007|no.|S|Bro024
mn007|i did not.|S|Bro024
mn058|huh.|B|Bro024
mn007|huh.|F|Bro024
mn058|because i mean it should have a similar effect if you|D|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn058|i mean you you have now several stages of smoothing so to say.|S|Bro024
mn058|you start up.|S|Bro024
mn058|as far as i remember you you smooth somehow the envelope.|S|Bro024
mn058|you smooth somehow the noise estimate.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn058|and and later on you smooth also this subtraction factor.|S|Bro024
mn007|huh.|B|Bro024
mn007|uh no.|S|Bro024
mn007|it's it's just the gain that's smoothed actually.|S|Bro024
mn052|uh actually i i do all the smoothing.|S|Bro024
mn007|but it's smoothed|D|Bro024
mn058|uh.|B|Bro024
mn058|oh it it was you.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|uh yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn007|no in this case it's just the gain.|S|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn007|and|F|Bro024
mn007|but the way it's done is that um for low gain there is this nonlinear smoothing actually.|S|Bro024
mn007|for low gains um i use the smoothed uh smoothed version.|S|Bro024
mn058|uh.|B|Bro024
mn007|but for high gain it's i don't smooth.|S|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn058|i just uh it experience shows you if if you do the|D|Bro024
mn058|the best is to do the smoothing as early as possible.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn058|so when you start up|D|Bro024
mn058|i mean you start up with the with the somehow with the noisy envelope.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn058|and best is to smooth this somehow.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn007|uh yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|i could try this.|S|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn058|and|D|Bro024
mn052|so before estimating the s.n.r. smooth the envelope.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn007|but|F|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn007|then i i would need to find a way to like smooth less also when there is high energy.|S|Bro024
mn007|because i noticed that it it helps a little bit to like smooth more during low energy portions and less during speech.|S|Bro024
mn058|yes.|S|Bro024
mn007|because if you smooth then you kind of distort the speech.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|right.|S|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|F|Bro024
mn058|yeah i think when|D|Bro024
mn058|you you could do it in this way that you say if you if i'm|D|Bro024
mn058|you have somehow a noise estimate.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn058|and if you say i'm i'm with my envelope.|S|Bro024
mn058|i'm close to this noise estimate.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn058|and then you you would like to have a stronger smoothing.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn058|so you could you could base it on your estimation of the signal to noise ratio on your actual|D|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn007|huh.|B|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|or some silence probability from the vad if you have|D|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|but i don't trust the current vad.|S|Bro024
mn007|so|F|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|uh so not not right now maybe.|S|Bro024
mn007|well maybe.|S|Bro024
mn007|maybe.|S|Bro024
me013|the vad later will be much better.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|F|Bro024
me013|so|F|Bro024
me013|i see.|S|Bro024
me018|so is that it?|Q|Bro024
mn007|uh fff i think that's it.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|uh|F|Bro024
mn058|so to summarize the performance of these speechdat-car results is similar than than yours so to say.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn052|so the fifty eight is like the some fifty six point.|S|Bro024
mn058|you have you have fifty six point four.|S|Bro024
mn058|and and and dependent on this additive constant it is better or or worse.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|that's true.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn052|slightly better?|Q|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn007|and yeah.|F|Bro024
mn007|the condition where it's better than your approach it's it just because maybe it's better on well matched and that the weight on well matched is is bigger.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah you you caught up.|S|Bro024
mn007|because|D|Bro024
mn052|yep.|S|Bro024
mn052|that's true.|S|Bro024
mn007|if you don't weigh differently the different condition you can see that your well the the two stage wiener filtering is maybe better.|S|Bro024
mn007|or|F|Bro024
mn007|it's better for high mismatch right?|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|it's better for high mismatch.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn007|but a little bit worse for well matched.|S|Bro024
mn052|so over all it gets yeah worse for the well matched condition.|S|Bro024
mn052|so|D|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me018|so we need to combine these two.|S|Bro024
mn052|uh|F|Bro024
mn052|that's that's the best thing is like the french telecom system is optimized for the well matched condition.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro024
mn052|they|D|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn052|so they know that the weighting is good for the well matched.|S|Bro024
mn052|and so there's|D|Bro024
mn052|everywhere the well matched's performance is very good for the french telecom.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
mn052|we are we may also have to do something similar.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|D|Bro024
me013|well our tradition here has always been to focus on the mismatched.|S|Bro024
mn052|um the|F|Bro024
me013|because it's more interesting.|S|Bro024
mn058|my mine was it too i mean.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|before i started working on this aurora.|S|Bro024
mn058|so|F|Bro024
me013|yeah.|D|Bro024
me013|yeah.|D|Bro024
me013|yeah.|B|Bro024
me013|okay.|F|Bro024
me018|carmen?|Q|Bro024
me018|do you uh|D|Bro024
fn002|well i only say that the this is a summary of the of all the v.t.s. experiments.|S|Bro024
fn002|and say that the result in the last um for italian the last experiment for italian are bad.|S|Bro024
fn002|i make a mistake when i write.|S|Bro024
fn002|up at d. i copy one of the bad result.|S|Bro024
mn052|so you|D|Bro024
fn002|and|F|Bro024
fn002|there you know this|D|Bro024
fn002|um|F|Bro024
fn002|well.|F|Bro024
fn002|if we put everything we improve a lot the spectral use of the v.t.s.|S|Bro024
fn002|but the final result are not still huh good like the wiener filter for example.|S|Bro024
fn002|i don't know.|S|Bro024
fn002|maybe it's it's possible to to have the same result.|S|Bro024
mn052|that's somewhere.|S|Bro024
fn002|i don't know exactly.|S|Bro024
fn002|huh.|F|Bro024
fn002|because i have huh worse result in medium mismatch and high mismatch.|S|Bro024
mn052|you you have a better|D|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn052|you have some results that are good for the high mismatch.|S|Bro024
fn002|and yeah.|F|Bro024
fn002|i are more or less similar but but are worse.|S|Bro024
fn002|and|F|Bro024
fn002|still i don't have the result for t.i. digits.|S|Bro024
fn002|the program is training.|S|Bro024
fn002|maybe for this weekend i will have result t.i. digits.|S|Bro024
fn002|and i can complete that like this.|S|Bro024
fn002|well.|F|Bro024
me013|uh.|B|Bro024
me013|right.|B|Bro024
fn002|one thing that i note are not here in this result but are speak are spoken before with sunil i i improve my result using clean l.d.a. filter.|S|Bro024
mn052|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
fn002|if i use uh the l.d.a. filter that are training with the noisy speech that hurts the my results.|S|Bro024
me013|so what are these numbers here?|Q|Bro024
me013|are these with the clean or with the noisy?|Q|Bro024
fn002|this is with the clean.|S|Bro024
me013|okay.|S|Bro024
fn002|with the noise i have worse result that if i doesn't use it.|S|Bro024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
fn002|but that may be because with this technique we are using really really clean speech.|S|Bro024
fn002|the speech the representation that go to the h.t.k. is really clean speech.|S|Bro024
fn002|because it's from the dictionary.|S|Bro024
fn002|the code book.|S|Bro024
fn002|and maybe from that.|S|Bro024
fn002|i don't know.|S|Bro024
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
fn002|because i think that you did some experiments using the two the two l.d.a. filter clean and and noise.|S|Bro024
mn007|it's|D|Bro024
fn002|and it doesn't matter too much.|S|Bro024
mn007|um|F|Bro024
mn007|yeah i did that.|S|Bro024
mn007|but it doesn't matter on speechdat-car.|S|Bro024
mn007|but it matters uh a lot on t.i. digits.|S|Bro024
fn002|it's better to use clean.|S|Bro024
mn052|using the clean filter.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|uh it's much better when you we used the clean derived l.d.a. filter.|S|Bro024
fn002|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
fn002|maybe you can do also this.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
fn002|to use clean speech.|S|Bro024
mn007|uh|F|Bro024
mn052|yeah i'll try.|S|Bro024
mn007|but yeah.|F|Bro024
mn007|sunil in in your result it's|D|Bro024
mn052|i i'll try the|D|Bro024
mn052|no i i my result is with the noisy noisy l.d.a.|S|Bro024
mn007|it's with the noisy one.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro024
me013|oh.|S|Bro024
mn052|it's with the noisy.|S|Bro024
mn007|so|F|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|it's it's not the clean l.d.a.|S|Bro024
me013|um|F|Bro024
mn052|it's in in the front sheet i have like like the summary.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|and and your result is with the|D|Bro024
mn007|it's with the clean l.d.a.|S|Bro024
mn052|oh.|S|Bro024
mn052|this is your results are all with the clean l.d.a. result.|S|Bro024
fn002|yeah with the clean l.d.a.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|okay.|S|Bro024
fn002|is that the reason?|Q|Bro024
mn007|and in your case it's all all noisy.|S|Bro024
mn052|all noisy.|S|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn007|but|F|Bro024
fn002|and|D|Bro024
mn052|uh|F|Bro024
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro024
mn052|uh|F|Bro024
mn007|but i observe my case it's in uh uh at least on speechdat-car it doesn't matter.|S|Bro024
mn007|but t.i. digits it's like two or three percent absolute uh better.|S|Bro024
mn052|on t.i. digits this matters.|S|Bro024
mn052|absolute.|S|Bro024
mn052|uh|F|Bro024
mn007|so if|D|Bro024
me013|so you really might want to try the clean i think.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah i i i will have to look at it.|S|Bro024
mn052|yeah that's true.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|B|Bro024
me013|yeah that could be sizeable right there.|S|Bro024
fn002|and this is everything.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|maybe you you are leaving in in about two weeks carmen.|S|Bro024
me013|okay.|B|Bro024
mn058|no?|Q|Bro024
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|S|Bro024
mn058|so i mean if if if i would put it put on the head of a project manager i i i would say uh um i mean there is not so much time left now.|S|Bro024
me013|be my guest.|S|Bro024
mn058|i mean if um|F|Bro024
mn058|what what i would do is i i i would pick the best consolation which you think.|S|Bro024
mn058|and create create all the results for the whole database that you get to the final number as as sunil did it.|S|Bro024
fn002|and prepare at the|D|Bro024
mn058|and um|F|Bro024
mn058|and maybe also to to write somehow a document where you describe your approach and what you have done.|S|Bro024
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro024
fn002|i was thinking to do that next week.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|B|Bro024
mn058|yeah.|B|Bro024
me013|yeah.|B|Bro024
me013|i'll i'll borrow the head back and and agree.|S|Bro024
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro024
fn002|i i i will do that next week.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|S|Bro024
me013|that's that's|D|Bro024
me013|right.|S|Bro024
me013|in fact actually i i guess the uh the spanish government uh requires that anyway.|S|Bro024
me013|they want some kind of report from everybody who's in the program.|S|Bro024
fn002|uhhuh.|B|Bro024
me013|so|F|Bro024
me013|and of course i'd we'd we'd like to see it too.|S|Bro024
me013|so|F|Bro024
fn002|okay.|S|Bro024
me013|yeah.|F|Bro024
me018|so um|F|Bro024
me018|what's do you think we uh should do the digits or skip it?|Q|Bro024
me018|or what are what do you think?|Q|Bro024
me013|uh we have them now?|Q|Bro024
me018|yeah.|S|Bro024
me018|got them.|S|Bro024
me013|uh why why don't we do it?|Q|Bro024
me018|okay.|S|Bro024
me013|just just take a minute.|S|Bro024
fn002|i can send|D|Bro024
fn002|yet.|S|Bro024
me018|would you pass those down?|Q|Bro024
me013|oh.|S|Bro024
me013|sorry.|S|Bro024
me018|okay.|F|Bro024
me018|um|F|Bro024
me018|so i guess i'll go ahead.|S|Bro024
me018|um|F|Bro024
