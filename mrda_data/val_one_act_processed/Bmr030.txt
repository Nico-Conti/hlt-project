me011|and we're on.|S|Bmr030
me011|so uh|F|Bmr030
mn014|time?|Q|Bmr030
mn014|fourteen whatever.|S|Bmr030
me011|so topic number one is we got the n s f a t r.|S|Bmr030
me011|i t r.|S|Bmr030
me011|excuse me.|S|Bmr030
me011|which was originally pretty big but it's divided among many sites.|D|Bmr030
me011|and they like cut the budget by a by two thirds.|S|Bmr030
me011|so they they approved it for all the sites.|S|Bmr030
me011|but only gave us like sixty two percent of the money.|S|Bmr030
me011|or excuse me cut it by sixty two percent.|S|Bmr030
mn014|thirty two.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah thirty whatever.|S|Bmr030
me011|so uh morgan is uh|D|Bmr030
me011|and the other condition is that they have to get a budget out like immediately.|S|Bmr030
me011|or or they'll give the money to someone else.|S|Bmr030
me018|by next friday.|S|Bmr030
me011|so morgan's working on that.|S|Bmr030
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
me011|so i mean it's good news.|S|Bmr030
me011|it's not as good as it could have been.|S|Bmr030
me011|but it was uh|D|Bmr030
me018|it's more money.|S|Bmr030
me011|the the i t rs are you know a a long shot and so it's it's really nice that we got that.|S|Bmr030
me001|what does that stand for?|Q|Bmr030
me011|information technology research.|S|Bmr030
me011|something like that.|S|Bmr030
me018|something like that.|S|Bmr030
me051|huh.|B|Bmr030
me001|all right.|S|Bmr030
me011|it's uh|D|Bmr030
mn014|doesn't say much.|S|Bmr030
me001|yeah it's pretty vague.|S|Bmr030
me018|it's it's um it's some money that we can use|D|Bmr030
me001|it's government run i guess.|S|Bmr030
me018|uh i mean we're in conjunction with uh s r i washington and um columbia.|S|Bmr030
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
me001|okay.|B|Bmr030
me018|and to do research on the meetings.|S|Bmr030
me001|cool.|B|Bmr030
me011|yeah it was specifically on the meeting.|S|Bmr030
mn014|not great.|S|Bmr030
me011|so was that the one that was the meeting maps?|Q|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|S|Bmr030
me011|okay good.|S|Bmr030
me011|i liked that one.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
mn014|what is meeting maps?|Q|Bmr030
me018|mapping meetings or|D|Bmr030
me011|well the the sort of general idea was you can think about meetings at lots of different levels.|S|Bmr030
me011|all the way from all the way down to acoustics to all the way up to dialogue discourse topic.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|and so this this was how do you map all that information onto that?|Q|Bmr030
me011|onto the meeting domain.|S|Bmr030
me018|it's like creating a a map of a meeting in a sense.|S|Bmr030
me011|so that the the analogy was you have maps of different things at different resolutions.|S|Bmr030
me011|and so uh|F|Bmr030
mn014|uh okay.|S|Bmr030
me011|so this had a lot of different stuff in it.|S|Bmr030
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr030
me018|it actually doesn't have a whole lot of speech stuff to it.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah sure.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah that's|D|Bmr030
me011|it's mostly higher level.|S|Bmr030
me018|it's|D|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me018|higher level yeah.|S|Bmr030
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|but nonetheless i think if we|D|Bmr030
me011|it's a it's a cool idea.|S|Bmr030
me011|and if we can actually get it get it going that would be neat.|S|Bmr030
me011|so and uh this was the one also that was|D|Bmr030
me011|uh|F|Bmr030
me011|was it with susan ervin tripp?|Q|Bmr030
me018|i don't remember.|S|Bmr030
me018|it might have been|D|Bmr030
me018|yeah we had to get some|D|Bmr030
mn014|with who?|Q|Bmr030
me011|she's a linguist on campus.|S|Bmr030
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr030
me011|anyway.|S|Bmr030
me011|so other topics i wanted to talk about are um the darpa demo which i guess since morgan isn't here we can't really talk about.|S|Bmr030
me011|i just wanted to make sure it was ready to go.|S|Bmr030
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|uh but i guess|D|Bmr030
me001|i sent|D|Bmr030
me011|your stuff is all ready.|S|Bmr030
me011|so it's just a question of did morgan get around to testing it?|Q|Bmr030
me001|yeah and i sent you an email|D|Bmr030
me011|yeah i got it with the instructions.|S|Bmr030
me001|with the instructions.|S|Bmr030
me001|i don't know.|S|Bmr030
me001|so morgan|D|Bmr030
me001|i guess morgan's leaving on saturday?|Q|Bmr030
me011|yep.|S|Bmr030
me001|so until then|D|Bmr030
me001|i guess we might hear something.|S|Bmr030
me011|yeah so i guess we we had better be on call for a little while.|S|Bmr030
me001|but|D|Bmr030
me001|yeah exactly.|S|Bmr030
me018|did he ever figure out how to switch between applications like he was wanting to do?|Q|Bmr030
me011|i don't know.|S|Bmr030
me011|i haven't spoken with him.|S|Bmr030
me001|yeah.|S|Bmr030
me018|he did?|Q|Bmr030
me001|yeah.|S|Bmr030
mn014|switch between applications?|Q|Bmr030
me018|how is he going to do it?|Q|Bmr030
me011|alt tab.|S|Bmr030
me001|it's just alt tab.|S|Bmr030
me001|like if you hold down alt and then tap tab you just the just the task manager window comes up.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah yeah he|D|Bmr030
mn014|yes that's|D|Bmr030
me011|i i think|D|Bmr030
me018|he|D|Bmr030
me018|right.|B|Bmr030
me011|i think the problem was that i was saying hit alt tab with the assumption that he knew what i meant.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|but he didn't.|S|Bmr030
me011|so|F|Bmr030
me018|no he said he tried that but he didn't like it because it|D|Bmr030
me001|well|D|Bmr030
me018|uh|F|Bmr030
me018|it took it out of the um|D|Bmr030
me011|but it doesn't.|S|Bmr030
me018|presentation mode.|S|Bmr030
me011|it doesn't.|S|Bmr030
me001|well because if you just touch alt|D|Bmr030
me001|if you just hit it once it'll go back to the previous application.|S|Bmr030
me001|and the previous application was the powerpoint demo.|S|Bmr030
me001|which was the display of like you know|D|Bmr030
me018|oh!|S|Bmr030
me011|and and all i said was oh just cycle through with alt tab.|S|Bmr030
me001|not the slide show.|S|Bmr030
me011|because that's the standard way of doing it in windows.|S|Bmr030
me001|yeah he didn't|D|Bmr030
me011|but of course he doesn't use windows.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me001|right.|B|Bmr030
me011|so|F|Bmr030
me011|he didn't know what i meant.|S|Bmr030
me018|oh so what do you have to do?|S|Bmr030
me051|huh.|B|Bmr030
me018|you have alt tab and|D|Bmr030
me011|hold down at hold down alt.|S|Bmr030
me011|and then tap tab several times.|S|Bmr030
me011|and you'll cycle through all the open applications.|S|Bmr030
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me018|uh okay and then it won't|D|Bmr030
me018|and then you can come back to your full screen version of your|D|Bmr030
me011|right.|S|Bmr030
me001|right.|B|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me018|oh!|S|Bmr030
me001|and i told them um if he decides to use multiple examples for um the prosody demo to open up separate transcribers.|S|Bmr030
me001|just so you don't have to load up files during the meeting.|S|Bmr030
me011|that's a good idea.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me001|so|F|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|that's not a bad idea at all.|S|Bmr030
me011|so that uh|D|Bmr030
me001|he's got the memory for it.|S|Bmr030
me001|so|F|Bmr030
me011|yeah and since the files are short it's just|D|Bmr030
me001|yeah they're all really short.|S|Bmr030
me011|i mean the tcl t k overhead is pretty high.|S|Bmr030
me011|but it shouldn't matter.|S|Bmr030
me018|how much memory does he have?|Q|Bmr030
me001|no i didn't have any problems.|S|Bmr030
me001|i'm sorry?|Q|Bmr030
me018|how much memory does he have?|Q|Bmr030
me001|i don't know.|S|Bmr030
me001|but it seemed it didn't seem to be a problem at all.|S|Bmr030
me001|i would imagine you add sixty four to a hundred and twenty eight.|S|Bmr030
me018|huh.|B|Bmr030
me011|i think he had one twenty eight.|S|Bmr030
me001|yeah either one will work i think.|S|Bmr030
me011|uh|F|Bmr030
me011|but|D|Bmr030
me011|it was faster than my p c.|S|Bmr030
me001|i mean it was|D|Bmr030
me018|huh.|B|Bmr030
me011|so|F|Bmr030
me018|wow!|S|Bmr030
me001|yeah it was fine i think|D|Bmr030
me001|yeah i mean i i i we kind of walked through it a little bit on his on his laptop.|S|Bmr030
me018|so are we the only ones who are giving demo or is uh washington going to have a demo too?|Q|Bmr030
me001|i could.|S|Bmr030
me011|i assume but they're all doing communicator stuff.|S|Bmr030
me018|or|D|Bmr030
me018|oh okay.|S|Bmr030
me011|so|F|Bmr030
me018|huh.|B|Bmr030
me001|and it's part of the talk itself.|S|Bmr030
me001|so it's really not a big part.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah i see.|S|Bmr030
me011|i mean the talk's only twenty minutes.|S|Bmr030
me001|it's just going to be a couple of|D|Bmr030
me011|so you know all this time we spent on it's going to be thirty seconds of screen time.|S|Bmr030
me001|i know.|B|Bmr030
me018|oh my gosh.|S|Bmr030
me001|right uhhuh|B|Bmr030
me018|oh!|S|Bmr030
me001|but it's a good tool to have.|S|Bmr030
me011|yeah|D|Bmr030
me001|the the the meeting i r stuff is actually|D|Bmr030
me011|actually both of them.|S|Bmr030
me011|you know because we're going to want to be playing with the|D|Bmr030
me001|uhhuh.|S|Bmr030
me011|uh|F|Bmr030
me011|help my brain.|S|Bmr030
me011|with the uh|D|Bmr030
me001|prosody?|Q|Bmr030
me011|prosody stuff anyway.|S|Bmr030
me011|um so actually at some point we should talk to users of that technology who are actually going to be using it.|S|Bmr030
me011|and see what they would like to see.|S|Bmr030
me001|yeah have you guys seen the display?|Q|Bmr030
me001|have you guys seen either of the demos?|Q|Bmr030
me001|they're pretty cool.|S|Bmr030
me018|no.|S|Bmr030
mn014|nope.|S|Bmr030
me001|like the prosody demo we basically loaded up um word alignments.|S|Bmr030
me001|so instead of having um utterances in the bottom it's like just word by word.|S|Bmr030
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
me001|so you can see exactly where the overlaps are.|S|Bmr030
me018|oh.|B|Bmr030
me001|and then um adam did something where um we converted these feature files into wave files.|S|Bmr030
me001|so you can display them.|D|Bmr030
me018|display the features.|S|Bmr030
mn014|instead of the wave file?|Q|Bmr030
me001|yeah instead of the wave file.|S|Bmr030
mn014|oh okay.|S|Bmr030
me001|and then using multi wave you can add a file and play that sound.|S|Bmr030
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
me001|play the audio corresponding to that um um feature file.|S|Bmr030
mn014|okay.|B|Bmr030
me001|and it's all like aligned and stuff.|S|Bmr030
mn014|uh great.|S|Bmr030
me018|so you see like the f zero contour?|Q|Bmr030
me001|yeah so you see the pitch contours.|S|Bmr030
me001|and you and when you hit play like there's a line that goes through it.|S|Bmr030
me001|you know and it's all aligned with like the the audio and the feature file.|S|Bmr030
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
mn014|oh that's great.|S|Bmr030
me011|audio.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|and the stylized f naught features are pretty cool.|S|Bmr030
me018|huh.|B|Bmr030
me001|yeah.|S|Bmr030
me011|so these does a piece wise linear.|S|Bmr030
me011|and so normally if you look at an f naught track it jumps all over the place.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|this is a nice smooth one.|S|Bmr030
me018|oh neat.|S|Bmr030
me011|and it really does a good job.|S|Bmr030
mn014|and there's something like a median filter in it or something?|Q|Bmr030
mn014|and uh and it's it's a linear fit or whatever.|S|Bmr030
me001|yeah there's a|D|Bmr030
me011|it's a combination.|S|Bmr030
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me001|there's a median filtering and then there's a piece wise linear fit based on some criteria.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me001|i'm not sure.|S|Bmr030
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr030
me011|uh|D|Bmr030
me011|actually could you email me a reference to that paper if you have it?|Q|Bmr030
me001|yeah sure.|S|Bmr030
me011|because i'm sort of curious how what criteria it has.|S|Bmr030
me001|i should email morgan about it too.|S|Bmr030
me001|because he was asking about that.|S|Bmr030
me001|and yeah.|F|Bmr030
me011|i mean so there's obviously a trade off between the number of knots you pick and the best fit.|S|Bmr030
me011|i mean so if you're doing a piece wise linear you have to figure out how many pieces you want.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
mn014|yeah sure.|S|Bmr030
me011|and so there's a trade off.|S|Bmr030
me011|because the best the best mean squared fit would be with an infinite number of knots.|S|Bmr030
me001|right well then it's not a linear fit.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
mn014|yeah yeah.|S|Bmr030
me001|you're not fitting anything then.|S|Bmr030
me011|well sure it is.|S|Bmr030
me011|but|D|Bmr030
me001|well|F|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|so so you there's a trade off.|S|Bmr030
me001|yeah it|D|Bmr030
me001|it's kind of a useless one.|S|Bmr030
me011|and i'm wondering what criteria they use.|S|Bmr030
me001|yeah i actually don't know off the top of my head.|S|Bmr030
me011|uhhuh.|D|Bmr030
me018|was this code that you downloaded to do this?|Q|Bmr030
me018|or was it|D|Bmr030
me001|this was um kemal sonmez at s r i.|S|Bmr030
me001|who's a co worker with uh liz.|S|Bmr030
me018|huh.|B|Bmr030
me011|dot com.|S|Bmr030
me018|at s r i dot com?|Q|Bmr030
me001|yeah did i just|D|Bmr030
me011|no i you said at s r i.|S|Bmr030
me018|no|D|Bmr030
me011|so i had to add the dot com.|S|Bmr030
me018|it sounded like a u r l the way you were saying it.|S|Bmr030
me001|oh oh.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me001|sorry.|S|Bmr030
me001|um yeah but so kamal has uh|D|Bmr030
me001|he did a paper on this for some speech verification uh project.|S|Bmr030
me001|and we basically extrapolated what he what he did for that work and applied it to our files.|S|Bmr030
me001|and that's how we do that's how we get our feature files and everything for all the prosody.|S|Bmr030
me018|so what i mean is like the implementation that you used was something that you coded up here?|Q|Bmr030
me018|or you grabbed code from somewhere else?|Q|Bmr030
me001|that|D|Bmr030
me001|no we grabbed most of it.|S|Bmr030
me001|like we grabbed the linear fitting stuff.|S|Bmr030
me018|uh.|S|Bmr030
me018|i see.|S|Bmr030
me001|we did all the alignments.|S|Bmr030
me001|and all the matching and stuff.|S|Bmr030
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
mn014|and|D|Bmr030
me001|but the actual coding of the|D|Bmr030
mn014|and|D|Bmr030
me001|the math was done somewhere else.|S|Bmr030
mn014|these are our f zero candidates which i'm supposed to use for the synthesis thing?|Q|Bmr030
mn014|i suppose?|Q|Bmr030
me001|uh so that's what you were working on.|S|Bmr030
me001|right?|Q|Bmr030
me051|right that's the same software i used to get the data.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah okay.|S|Bmr030
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr030
me051|i i gave you a couple examples.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah i didn't have time to to look at that.|S|Bmr030
me051|and|F|Bmr030
me011|huh.|D|Bmr030
mn014|so|F|Bmr030
me051|right right.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|so other topic is uh the i b m transcription status stuff.|S|Bmr030
me011|so we've sent a few to them.|S|Bmr030
me011|we've gotten a few back.|S|Bmr030
me011|um|F|Bmr030
me011|i sort of wish jane was were here.|S|Bmr030
me011|because i think she gave|D|Bmr030
me011|didn't she give one of them to one of the transcribers?|Q|Bmr030
me018|yeah it's done now.|S|Bmr030
me011|and how was it?|Q|Bmr030
me018|she said it was much faster.|S|Bmr030
me011|great.|S|Bmr030
me018|it really helped a lot to have that.|S|Bmr030
me018|so um you know there were a|D|Bmr030
mn014|much faster than doing everything alone?|Q|Bmr030
me011|hand.|S|Bmr030
me018|from scratch.|S|Bmr030
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah so|D|Bmr030
me001|from end to like from the beginning of the process to the end of the process?|Q|Bmr030
me018|no no so from the point where we take it it's faster.|S|Bmr030
me011|well but that's what we wanted.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|right?|Q|Bmr030
me011|we knew it would be longer to have multiple groups.|S|Bmr030
me001|ooo yeah.|B|Bmr030
me018|so it's sort of like doing things in parallel.|S|Bmr030
me001|yeah right.|S|Bmr030
me011|right.|B|Bmr030
me018|you know so if you know if they can be working on that while we're working on the other things then when we get them in they don't have to do that one from scratch basically.|S|Bmr030
me011|well pipelined.|S|Bmr030
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
me001|right.|B|Bmr030
me011|the idea is that we're taking less time of the linguists.|S|Bmr030
me001|right.|B|Bmr030
me011|of the transcribers.|S|Bmr030
me011|so|F|Bmr030
me018|yeah right now it is taking a bit of time to turn around the meetings from i b m.|S|Bmr030
me018|there's there's several problems.|S|Bmr030
me018|one is um we were giving them these large files.|S|Bmr030
me018|which they then had to split up and put onto cassette tapes.|S|Bmr030
me018|so either ninety minute or sixty minute tapes.|S|Bmr030
me001|oh wow.|S|Bmr030
me018|so they had to try to find an appropriate place to break this large file that we gave them.|S|Bmr030
me018|so one of the things that we did is adam made a modification to his script that generates this so you can tell it that you want uh basically uh chunks that are no more than either thirty or forty five minutes.|S|Bmr030
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
me018|and then we can give those to i b m.|S|Bmr030
me018|and it'll make it easier for them to put them on tape.|S|Bmr030
me018|um then the other thing is that these pool of transcribers that they're using um sort of are not dedicated to to our project.|S|Bmr030
me018|but are in use for all i b m projects.|S|Bmr030
me018|and i b m has recently giving given them uh a whole bunch of stuff.|S|Bmr030
me018|so it's going to sort of delay us.|S|Bmr030
me011|we might want to re visit hiring our own external transcription company.|S|Bmr030
me011|because i think that would be cheaper than having our people do it.|S|Bmr030
me011|but do it with the same process with these beep files.|S|Bmr030
me018|huh that's an interesting idea.|S|Bmr030
me011|i mean because originally i had discounted that.|S|Bmr030
me011|because it was just going to be too hard.|S|Bmr030
me011|but now we have this procedure with the beep files worked out.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah so the only difference would be we would be putting the stuff on tape versus i b m.|S|Bmr030
me011|then maybe it would be okay.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|yep.|B|Bmr030
me018|and then we could send if if we had that process down of putting the audio onto tape|D|Bmr030
me018|we can send i b m the tapes or we can send this transcription place the|D|Bmr030
me011|and we might want to do that anyway.|S|Bmr030
me011|because it seems like that's being a bottleneck and that's silly.|S|Bmr030
me011|it shouldn't be a bottleneck.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|i mean it would once we got it set up it it|D|Bmr030
me018|well|D|Bmr030
me018|so i don't know where the bottleneck was.|S|Bmr030
me018|was the bottleneck in breaking this large file up into the appropriate size chunks or was it actually putting it onto the tape?|Q|Bmr030
me011|it may well have been partially that you know.|S|Bmr030
me011|because they tried it.|S|Bmr030
me011|and then they would have to listen to the tape and find out where it bleeps.|S|Bmr030
me018|exactly.|S|Bmr030
me011|and go forward in the file et cetera et cetera.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|but uh|F|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|it just seems like it's not hard for us to do.|S|Bmr030
me011|and that would just make things go faster.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah so how do we do that?|S|Bmr030
me018|how would we put|D|Bmr030
me011|get a tape deck.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|plug it in to the computer.|S|Bmr030
mn014|plug it into the sound card.|S|Bmr030
me011|hit record.|S|Bmr030
me011|on the tape deck.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|and just do it all all uh analog.|S|Bmr030
me018|so plug so like the headphone output in the back of the computer?|Q|Bmr030
me011|well line out.|S|Bmr030
mn014|line out yeah.|S|Bmr030
me018|line out into the line in on a tape player.|S|Bmr030
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
me001|huh.|B|Bmr030
mn014|yep.|S|Bmr030
me018|and|F|Bmr030
me018|oh well that sounds pretty easy.|S|Bmr030
me011|so i mean that's the easy way.|S|Bmr030
me011|they might have a more complex set up at i b m.|S|Bmr030
me011|i've seen digital digital analog tapes where it's controlled by the computer.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah but the easy way is|D|Bmr030
me018|huh.|B|Bmr030
me011|but but we don't need to do that.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah i know.|S|Bmr030
mn014|no.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|the the disadvantage of doing it this way is it's real time.|S|Bmr030
me011|so you would have to sit there for an hour while it's recording.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah but if it was at your desk or something|D|Bmr030
me011|but|D|Bmr030
mn014|yeah but you|D|Bmr030
mn014|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|right it's not a big deal.|S|Bmr030
me001|so what's the turn around period right now from i b m?|Q|Bmr030
me018|well they there was|D|Bmr030
me001|should we be discussing this|D|Bmr030
me018|okay.|F|Bmr030
me018|so th they um they gave they've given us|D|Bmr030
me018|since we started doing this new uh beep format with beep number beep|D|Bmr030
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
me018|they've given us uh i think two full uh transcripts.|S|Bmr030
me018|they have a third one.|S|Bmr030
me018|and brian just sent me a note saying oh that third one somehow slipped through the cracks of their of the uh transcriptionists' uh company.|S|Bmr030
me001|huh.|B|Bmr030
me018|and so there's going to be delay of a week before we get that third one back.|S|Bmr030
me018|and i've already given him three more to work on.|S|Bmr030
me001|okay.|B|Bmr030
me018|but he said those new three won't get done until this big chunk of data has been processed by the company.|S|Bmr030
me001|okay.|B|Bmr030
me001|and the transcribers here are still uh are working though.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah yeah they're working away.|S|Bmr030
me001|they're just doing their own thing like while they're waiting.|S|Bmr030
me018|they're just doing|D|Bmr030
me018|right right.|B|Bmr030
me001|okay.|B|Bmr030
me018|so what we do is uh when i go to um select meetings for i b m i go into the um|D|Bmr030
me018|well into the the uh master sheet here with the statuses|D|Bmr030
me011|master.|S|Bmr030
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
me018|and i pick ones that thilo has um pre segmented.|S|Bmr030
me018|and i change the status to i p i b m.|S|Bmr030
me018|so that you know when jane or whoever goes to select the next meeting they won't choose one of those.|S|Bmr030
me018|and um|F|Bmr030
me018|so i'm not picking huge chunks right now of meetings for them.|S|Bmr030
me011|so|F|Bmr030
me011|we should at least ask um brian if there are any particular requirements for putting things on tape.|S|Bmr030
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
me018|but|D|Bmr030
me011|is there a particular type of tape that they want to use or anything else like that?|Q|Bmr030
me018|uhhuh that's a good idea.|S|Bmr030
me011|and uh|F|Bmr030
me011|and then we should see how much of a pain it is for one of us.|S|Bmr030
me011|i mean the the other problem is you would want to do it on an unloaded machine.|S|Bmr030
me011|right?|Q|Bmr030
me011|because you wouldn't want it to start stuttering.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yep.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me018|huh.|S|Bmr030
me011|and that means that that's more of a problem.|S|Bmr030
mn014|and all|D|Bmr030
me011|because then you have to be there.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
mn014|and all of the p cs are connected to the network too here?|Q|Bmr030
me001|what|D|Bmr030
mn014|or uh|F|Bmr030
me011|right.|S|Bmr030
me001|you're just talking about playing it and recording it like real time?|Q|Bmr030
mn014|bad|D|Bmr030
me011|yep.|S|Bmr030
me001|oh.|S|Bmr030
me018|so when that thing when it stutters like that is it because there's a delay getting the data off a disk or is it because there's a delay in the d to a?|Q|Bmr030
me011|uhhuh.|S|Bmr030
me011|it could be either.|S|Bmr030
me011|i mean there are lots of different places.|S|Bmr030
me018|okay.|S|Bmr030
me011|it can be delay on the disk.|S|Bmr030
me011|or it can be just load gets high on the machine.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|um either i o load or processor load.|S|Bmr030
me018|i see.|S|Bmr030
me011|you know it's a problem with these multi user systems is that lots of processes are running.|S|Bmr030
me011|and you don't really have control.|S|Bmr030
me018|maybe we could do it from a a p c or something.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr030
mn014|but they are also on the networks.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
mn014|so|F|Bmr030
me051|if you used a line out too you have to worry about if you click around and you hit a beep or something it'll beep onto onto the tape too.|S|Bmr030
mn014|maybe.|S|Bmr030
me011|that's true.|S|Bmr030
me011|it'll|D|Bmr030
me011|that's right so you really do want to be using a machine that's not.|S|Bmr030
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
me001|and you have to record every channel separately.|S|Bmr030
me011|no because we're doing the beep files.|S|Bmr030
mn014|the beep files.|S|Bmr030
me018|well you know i i think david might have a bunch of old p cs.|S|Bmr030
me001|oh okay.|S|Bmr030
me018|because he's replacing them with these new ones.|S|Bmr030
me018|maybe we could get one.|S|Bmr030
me018|and just dedicate it to doing this.|S|Bmr030
me018|not even hook it|D|Bmr030
me018|well i guess we need to hook it to the network.|S|Bmr030
me001|we|D|Bmr030
me018|so we can get the files to it.|S|Bmr030
me018|but|F|Bmr030
me011|yep.|S|Bmr030
me018|uh|F|Bmr030
me011|or you could just you could have it no active connection.|S|Bmr030
me011|just s c p them.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah right.|S|Bmr030
me018|and then just use that machine to hook up to the tape.|S|Bmr030
me011|actually it wouldn't be bad to have that plus put on that machine a c d burner.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yep.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|S|Bmr030
me018|we don't need a powerful machine to do these things.|S|Bmr030
me018|right?|Q|Bmr030
me011|no.|S|Bmr030
me018|so one of these old pentiums that we have|D|Bmr030
me018|huh!|S|Bmr030
me018|should talk to him about that.|S|Bmr030
mn014|or even a d v d burner.|S|Bmr030
me011|a d v d burner yeah.|S|Bmr030
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
me011|i guess the real question is where would we put it and who would do it?|Q|Bmr030
me011|i guess whoever records the meeting.|S|Bmr030
me011|i mean it's not a big deal.|S|Bmr030
me011|but it's yet another thing you have to do.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah yeah.|S|Bmr030
me018|that's why i wanted to avoid having to do that if we could.|S|Bmr030
me018|but|F|Bmr030
me018|it's just another|D|Bmr030
me001|they couldn't use c ds?|Q|Bmr030
me011|no because the transcription company does what they do.|S|Bmr030
me018|they have a um a device that you put the cassette in.|S|Bmr030
me018|and it has a foot pedal that lets you go back and forth and stuff like that.|S|Bmr030
me001|oh i see.|S|Bmr030
me001|i see.|S|Bmr030
me018|so|F|Bmr030
me018|i guess they haven't got a|D|Bmr030
me011|actually there are a few i saw a web based one at one point.|S|Bmr030
mn014|web based?|Q|Bmr030
me011|where you could send them audio files over the web.|S|Bmr030
me011|and they send you back text files over the web.|S|Bmr030
me018|really?|Q|Bmr030
me011|i should look that up again.|S|Bmr030
me018|can you send them huge audio files?|Q|Bmr030
mn014|you can.|S|Bmr030
mn014|but they never will be able to read them.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|i assume that you can send them anything that they can access with h t t p.|S|Bmr030
me018|huh!|S|Bmr030
me001|well they must be dealing with large amounts of data if they're transcribing anyway.|S|Bmr030
me018|that's interesting.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr030
me001|i mean people probably aren't sending them you know an utterance or two.|S|Bmr030
me018|well that's true.|S|Bmr030
me018|are how big are these files that we send to brian?|Q|Bmr030
mn014|uh pfff!|D|Bmr030
me011|half a gig.|S|Bmr030
me018|really?|Q|Bmr030
me018|that big?|Q|Bmr030
me011|oh no wait.|S|Bmr030
me018|i thought it was like a hundred megs.|S|Bmr030
me011|they're the beep files.|S|Bmr030
me011|yeah it's a hundred meg.|S|Bmr030
me011|they're the beep files.|S|Bmr030
me011|that's right.|S|Bmr030
me011|so they're smaller.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me018|huh!|S|Bmr030
me018|that's still pretty dang big.|S|Bmr030
me011|yes.|S|Bmr030
mn014|send it via email.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|S|Bmr030
me011|and we are sending them the compressed ones.|S|Bmr030
me011|right?|Q|Bmr030
me018|i don't know.|S|Bmr030
me018|whatever you generate|D|Bmr030
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me018|yeah the last ones you did were compressed.|S|Bmr030
me011|were shortened.|S|Bmr030
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me018|wonder if the ones before that were shortened.|S|Bmr030
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|the beep files actually the shorten doesn't save a whole lot.|S|Bmr030
me011|right?|Q|Bmr030
me018|because it's all|D|Bmr030
me011|because the whole point is that it's extracting parts that are loud anyway.|S|Bmr030
mn014|it's all speech.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr030
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
me018|huh!|S|Bmr030
me011|so|F|Bmr030
me018|huh.|B|Bmr030
me011|i think it only saves like half.|S|Bmr030
mn014|only.|S|Bmr030
me011|okay so i think we just got to let things slide for now.|S|Bmr030
me011|and see see what's going to happen.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|nothing else really to do.|S|Bmr030
me011|um|F|Bmr030
me011|we have new equipment that i'm going to try to set up tomorrow.|S|Bmr030
me011|new wireless.|S|Bmr030
me018|what will that do?|Q|Bmr030
me011|and so uh|F|Bmr030
me018|is that going to|D|Bmr030
me011|give us a couple more wireless channels.|S|Bmr030
me018|oh so we can get rid of the uh|D|Bmr030
me011|yep.|S|Bmr030
me018|oh that'll be nice.|S|Bmr030
me011|yep.|S|Bmr030
me011|but it involves rewiring.|S|Bmr030
me011|and so if i could borrow someone tomorrow afternoon to help my brain|D|Bmr030
me018|i should be around.|S|Bmr030
me011|you know just have someone to bounce the instructions off of.|S|Bmr030
me011|and make sure i don't do anything too stupid.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah sure.|S|Bmr030
me011|did i have another topic on the on the list?|Q|Bmr030
me018|experiments?|Q|Bmr030
me001|isn't that next week?|Q|Bmr030
mn014|experiments?|Q|Bmr030
me011|that's|D|Bmr030
me018|yeah i guess that's probably next|D|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
mn014|these are next week.|S|Bmr030
me011|what did i have on the agenda i mailed out?|Q|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me001|i think it was|D|Bmr030
me001|oh yeah i don't know.|S|Bmr030
mn014|the demo.|S|Bmr030
me018|something about|D|Bmr030
me001|the demo was one of them.|S|Bmr030
mn014|demo and i b m i think.|S|Bmr030
me018|demo.|S|Bmr030
me011|yeah that's it.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me001|yeah i think that's it.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|that was it.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
mn014|short meeting?|Q|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|S|Bmr030
me011|short meeting.|S|Bmr030
me011|does anyone have anything else?|Q|Bmr030
me018|oh i made a|D|Bmr030
me018|oh but that's not specific to meeting recorder.|S|Bmr030
me018|i was going to say i took some a suggestion of adam's.|S|Bmr030
me018|and i um created a c g i script that lets you see the current status of the speech disks.|S|Bmr030
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
me018|so if you go to the speech local web page and then there's a disk status page.|S|Bmr030
me018|you can click on that.|S|Bmr030
me018|and it'll query abbott.|S|Bmr030
me018|and give you a a list of all the disks that we have.|S|Bmr030
me018|and then uh what's on each one.|S|Bmr030
me018|and then it shows how big the disk is.|S|Bmr030
me018|and what percent full it is.|S|Bmr030
me001|cool.|S|Bmr030
me018|so|F|Bmr030
me018|and that's you know each time you go there it's updated.|S|Bmr030
me018|so|F|Bmr030
me001|so the new disks are installed now?|Q|Bmr030
mn014|so what what|D|Bmr030
me001|or|D|Bmr030
me018|the new disks are installed.|S|Bmr030
me018|if you need space just let me know.|S|Bmr030
me018|i have to create the appropriate sub directory.|S|Bmr030
me018|so we're kind of trying to keep even the scratch ones we're keeping a little organized where we put a a u doctor speech data.|S|Bmr030
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
me018|and then i'll either create a sub directory for like if it's meeting recorder project or hub five or whatever.|S|Bmr030
me018|so we|D|Bmr030
me018|i just have to create those sub directories.|S|Bmr030
me001|okay.|B|Bmr030
me011|do we have new d d disks also?|Q|Bmr030
me018|and|D|Bmr030
me018|no.|S|Bmr030
me011|darn.|S|Bmr030
me018|no.|S|Bmr030
me018|nnn.|D|Bmr030
me011|so it's all just scratch.|S|Bmr030
me018|it's all scratch.|S|Bmr030
me011|okay.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|how are we doing on|D|Bmr030
me018|uh d e which is where we're putting all the meeting stuff|D|Bmr030
me011|no d e is full.|S|Bmr030
me011|we must be doing it on d f.|S|Bmr030
me018|no it's d e.|S|Bmr030
mn014|d e i think.|S|Bmr030
me018|d e's not full.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah?|Q|Bmr030
mn014|d d is full.|S|Bmr030
me018|d d's full.|S|Bmr030
me018|that was the first one.|S|Bmr030
me018|or that was the last one that filled up.|S|Bmr030
me018|and d e still had like|D|Bmr030
me011|okay i guess i'm just one off.|S|Bmr030
me018|last time i looked it was like seven gigs or something.|S|Bmr030
me011|okay.|S|Bmr030
me018|so|F|Bmr030
me018|and each meeting is roughly half a gig.|S|Bmr030
me011|half.|S|Bmr030
me018|and so|F|Bmr030
me011|so that means we're getting pretty close.|S|Bmr030
me018|we're getting close.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|S|Bmr030
me018|so|F|Bmr030
me011|shoot!|S|Bmr030
me001|are we just going to keep recording?|Q|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me001|like at some point|D|Bmr030
me018|morgan said something about stopping at the end of the year.|S|Bmr030
me001|okay.|S|Bmr030
me018|like when we get around a hundred meetings.|S|Bmr030
me001|okay.|S|Bmr030
me018|um because there's going to be data coming from u w hopefully by then.|S|Bmr030
me001|because|D|Bmr030
me011|i just hate not to get data.|S|Bmr030
me001|how|D|Bmr030
me018|yeah it feels funny.|S|Bmr030
me018|huh?|Q|Bmr030
me001|you're a data fiend.|S|Bmr030
me018|if we have the capability.|S|Bmr030
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me001|yeah it's like you build this room up for so long.|S|Bmr030
me001|and then it's just like you stop.|S|Bmr030
me018|now that we're used to recording it's like uh well why not keep going?|Q|Bmr030
me011|i the other thing we could do is stop doing the regular ones.|S|Bmr030
me011|and try to convince other topics to come in and do some.|S|Bmr030
me011|because i think that would be nice.|S|Bmr030
me018|uhhuh.|S|Bmr030
me018|we have right now like seventy five or seventy six hours of meetings.|S|Bmr030
me011|yeah the other thing we were talking about also is once we once the disk has been backed up we don't actually need it online.|S|Bmr030
me011|so another option is to copy it to tape manually.|S|Bmr030
me011|so we have the back up copy and the tape copy.|S|Bmr030
me011|the archive copy and the back up copy.|S|Bmr030
me011|and then just take them off line.|S|Bmr030
me018|but aren't we still using the uh compressed|D|Bmr030
me011|once we have the expanded versions.|S|Bmr030
me011|so if we have a ton of scratch disk maybe the thing to do is leave those up.|S|Bmr030
me018|oh.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me011|and then use and then not necessarily have the original data online.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah we need to figure something out.|S|Bmr030
me018|because the abbott is basically|D|Bmr030
me011|full.|S|Bmr030
me018|we can't add anymore disks to it.|S|Bmr030
me018|we can increase the size of the disks that are on it.|S|Bmr030
me018|but that will only take us so far.|S|Bmr030
me018|so um|F|Bmr030
me018|david had the suggestion about you know new servers and things like that.|S|Bmr030
me018|and so i'm going to see if we can talk to morgan about getting some money for a new disk server.|S|Bmr030
me018|and uh|F|Bmr030
me011|well that would be pretty tight in the machine room.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah it would have to replace abbott basically.|S|Bmr030
me011|eesh!|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me018|well he david's planning to get new servers anyways for all of the main servers.|S|Bmr030
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
me018|i think he wants to sort of go with the same type of machine for all of these.|S|Bmr030
me018|but um|F|Bmr030
me018|yeah it's full in there.|S|Bmr030
me018|have you seen it recently with all of the new machines that we got|D|Bmr030
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
me018|uh the sun blade one hundreds.|S|Bmr030
me018|they're like stacked up on benches and things all over.|S|Bmr030
me018|it's really crowded.|S|Bmr030
me018|so|F|Bmr030
mn014|but they are not yet accessible?|Q|Bmr030
mn014|the new machines.|S|Bmr030
me018|oh yeah yeah yeah.|S|Bmr030
mn014|yeah they are?|Q|Bmr030
me018|they're in the yeah if you do a p make|D|Bmr030
mn014|oop!|S|Bmr030
me011|what are they called?|Q|Bmr030
me011|what are they named?|Q|Bmr030
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me018|oh i've forgotten now.|S|Bmr030
me018|um|F|Bmr030
me011|i assume they're in the p make pool.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah they're in the p make pool.|S|Bmr030
me018|so if you do a reginfo minus show attribute and|D|Bmr030
me018|uh|F|Bmr030
mn014|a what?|Q|Bmr030
me018|a|D|Bmr030
me011|p make stuff.|S|Bmr030
me011|p make magic.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah|B|Bmr030
me011|or customs magic.|S|Bmr030
mn014|oh god!|S|Bmr030
me018|you can get a list of all the machines that are available to p make by using the command reginfo.|S|Bmr030
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr030
mn014|reginfo okay.|S|Bmr030
me018|minus show a t t r.|S|Bmr030
mn014|maybe you can send me that.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|S|Bmr030
me018|and then um|D|Bmr030
me011|if you do man customs it has almost all of that.|S|Bmr030
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr030
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr030
me018|and i i'm not sure what attributes we attach to the sun blade one hundreds.|S|Bmr030
me018|but it could be s.b. one hundred.|S|Bmr030
me018|and so if you query for all machines that have that attribute then you should see the names of the new machines.|S|Bmr030
mn014|okay.|B|Bmr030
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr030
me018|but|F|Bmr030
me011|do we have an attribute for non interactive machines?|Q|Bmr030
me011|because i was thinking that would be a good one to have.|S|Bmr030
me018|non interactive|D|Bmr030
me011|ones that aren't on people's desks.|S|Bmr030
me018|well there's sort of.|S|Bmr030
me018|there's this one called there's the attribute called what's that called uh uh no evict.|S|Bmr030
me018|which is roughly that.|S|Bmr030
me011|right.|S|Bmr030
me018|it's although it's like my machine has it on my desk.|S|Bmr030
me018|so i do get jobs running on my machine all the time.|S|Bmr030
me018|um but uh|F|Bmr030
me018|so so that's that's sort of what it is.|S|Bmr030
me011|yep.|B|Bmr030
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr030
me011|anyway.|F|Bmr030
me011|shall we do digits?|Q|Bmr030
me018|sure.|S|Bmr030
