me011|so we're on.|S|Bmr024
me011|and somewhere is my agenda.|S|Bmr024
me011|i think the most important thing is morgan wanted to talk about uh the arpa demo.|S|Bmr024
me013|well so here's the thing.|S|Bmr024
me013|um why don't we again start off with with|D|Bmr024
me013|uh uh|F|Bmr024
me013|yeah i'll get it.|S|Bmr024
me013|i'll get the door.|D|Bmr024
me013|um i think we want to start off with the agenda.|S|Bmr024
me013|and then given that uh liz and andreas are going to be ten fifteen minutes late we can try to figure out what we can do most effectively without them here.|S|Bmr024
me013|so so so one thing is yeah talk about demo.|S|Bmr024
me011|okay.|F|Bmr024
me011|so uh.|F|Bmr024
me011|uh i b m transcription status.|S|Bmr024
me013|i b m transcription.|S|Bmr024
me013|uh what else?|Q|Bmr024
me011|smartkom.|S|Bmr024
me013|smartkom.|S|Bmr024
me013|smartkom.|S|Bmr024
me013|what's smartkom?|Q|Bmr024
me011|uh we want to talk about if if we want to add the data to the meeting recorder corpus.|S|Bmr024
mn014|the data.|D|Bmr024
mn014|the data which we are collecting here.|S|Bmr024
me013|what what what are we collecting here?|Q|Bmr024
mn014|data.|S|Bmr024
me011|so why don't we have that on the agenda and we'll we'll get to it and talk about it?|Q|Bmr024
mn014|the smartkom data.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah right.|B|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|uh right.|B|Bmr024
me013|uh.|F|Bmr024
me011|uh reorganization status.|S|Bmr024
me013|reorganization status.|S|Bmr024
fe008|oh.|F|Bmr024
fe008|files and directories?|Q|Bmr024
me013|files and directories.|S|Bmr024
me011|yep.|B|Bmr024
me011|uhhuh.|F|Bmr024
me011|absinthe which is the multiprocessor unix linux.|S|Bmr024
me011|i think it was andreas wanted to talk about segmentation and recognition.|S|Bmr024
me011|and update on s r i recognition experiments.|S|Bmr024
me013|um|F|Bmr024
me011|and then if if there's time i wanted to talk about digits.|S|Bmr024
me011|but it looked like we were pretty full so i can wait till next week.|S|Bmr024
me013|right.|B|Bmr024
me013|okay.|B|Bmr024
me013|well let's see.|S|Bmr024
me013|i think the certainly the segmentation and recognition we want to maybe focus on when andreas is here since that was particularly his thing.|S|Bmr024
mn014|and also the smartkom thing should|D|Bmr024
me013|smartkom also andreas.|S|Bmr024
me013|absinthe i think also he has sort of been involved in a lot of those things.|S|Bmr024
me011|at least|D|Bmr024
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|he'll he'll probably be interested.|S|Bmr024
me011|but|F|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr024
me013|um|F|Bmr024
me013|so i mean i think they'll be i'll be interested in all this.|S|Bmr024
me013|but but uh probably if we had to pick something that we would talk on for ten minutes or so while they're coming here or i guess it would be you think reorganization status?|Q|Bmr024
me013|or|F|Bmr024
me011|yeah.|F|Bmr024
me011|i mean i think chuck was the one who added out the agenda item.|S|Bmr024
me011|i don't really have anything to say other than that we still haven't done it.|S|Bmr024
me011|so|F|Bmr024
me018|well i mean i uh just basically that|D|Bmr024
me018|maybe i said maybe we said this before just that we met and we talked about it.|S|Bmr024
me018|and we sort of have a plan for getting things organized.|S|Bmr024
me018|and|F|Bmr024
fe008|and i and i think a crucial part of that is the idea of of not wanting to do it until right before the next level zero back up so that there won't be huge number of of added.|S|Bmr024
me018|right.|S|Bmr024
fe008|uh|F|Bmr024
me011|right.|S|Bmr024
me018|that that was basically it.|S|Bmr024
me018|not not much.|D|Bmr024
me011|although dave basically said that if we want to do it just tell him and he'll do a level zero then.|S|Bmr024
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr024
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Bmr024
fe008|oh excellent.|S|Bmr024
me011|so|F|Bmr024
me018|oh so maybe we should just go ahead and get everything ready.|S|Bmr024
fe008|oh good.|S|Bmr024
me018|and|F|Bmr024
me011|yep.|S|Bmr024
me011|so i think we do need to talk a little bit about|D|Bmr024
me011|well we don't need to do it during this meeting.|S|Bmr024
me011|we have a little more to discuss.|S|Bmr024
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|but uh we're we're basically ready to do it.|S|Bmr024
me011|and uh i have some web pages on more of the background.|S|Bmr024
me011|so naming conventions and things like that that i've been trying to keep actually up to date.|S|Bmr024
me011|so|F|Bmr024
me011|and i've been sharing them with u u w folks also.|S|Bmr024
fe008|i'm sorry you've been what?|Q|Bmr024
me013|okay.|D|Bmr024
fe008|showing them?|Q|Bmr024
me011|sharing them with the u w folks.|S|Bmr024
fe008|sharing them.|S|Bmr024
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr024
fe008|okay.|B|Bmr024
me013|okay.|F|Bmr024
me013|well maybe uh since that that was a pretty short one maybe we should talk about the i b m transcription status.|S|Bmr024
me013|someone can fill in liz and andreas later.|S|Bmr024
me011|okay.|S|Bmr024
me013|uh|B|Bmr024
me011|so we uh we did another version of the beeps where we separated each beeps with a spoken digit.|S|Bmr024
me011|chuck came up here and recorded some himself speaking some digits.|S|Bmr024
me011|and so it just goes beep one beep and then the phrase.|S|Bmr024
me011|and then beep two beep and then the phrase.|S|Bmr024
me011|and that seems pretty good.|S|Bmr024
me011|um i think they'll have a easier time keeping track of where they are in the file.|S|Bmr024
mn014|and we have done that on the automatic segmentations.|S|Bmr024
me011|and we did it with the automatic segmentation.|S|Bmr024
me011|and i don't think we we didn't look at it in detail.|S|Bmr024
me011|we just sent it to i b m.|S|Bmr024
me011|we we sort of spot checked it.|S|Bmr024
me018|i listened to probably uh five or ten minutes of it from the beginning.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|D|Bmr024
me011|oh really?|Q|Bmr024
me011|okay.|F|Bmr024
me018|yeah.|S|Bmr024
me018|and|F|Bmr024
me011|i sort of spot checked here and there and it sounded pretty good.|S|Bmr024
me011|so i think it'll work.|S|Bmr024
me013|okay.|S|Bmr024
me011|and uh we'll just have to see what we get back from them.|S|Bmr024
me011|uh|F|Bmr024
me018|and the main thing will be if we can align what they give us with what we sent them.|S|Bmr024
me018|i mean that's the crucial part.|S|Bmr024
me011|right.|S|Bmr024
me018|and i think we'll be able to do that at with this new beep format.|S|Bmr024
me011|yep.|S|Bmr024
me011|well i think it's also they are much less likely to have errors.|S|Bmr024
me018|uhhuh.|S|Bmr024
me011|i mean so the problem last time is that there were errors in the transcripts where they put beeps where there weren't any or and they put in extraneous beeps.|S|Bmr024
me018|right.|S|Bmr024
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|and with the numbers there it's much less likely.|S|Bmr024
me018|yeah one interesting note is uh or problem|D|Bmr024
me018|i don't know if this was just because of how i play it back i say uh s n d play and then the file.|S|Bmr024
me018|every once in a while uh like a beep sounds like it's cut into two beeps.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr024
mn014|into two pieces.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr024
me018|yeah and i i don't know if that's an uh artifact of playback.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr024
me018|uh i don't think it's probably in the original file.|S|Bmr024
me018|um but uh|F|Bmr024
mn014|i recognize that too.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|D|Bmr024
me011|ha.|D|Bmr024
me011|that's interesting.|S|Bmr024
me011|i didn't hear that.|S|Bmr024
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me018|but with this new format um that hopefully they're not hearing that and if they are it shouldn't throw them.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr024
me018|so|F|Bmr024
me011|well maybe we better listen to it again.|S|Bmr024
me011|make sure.|S|Bmr024
me011|but i mean certainly the software shouldn't do that.|S|Bmr024
me018|yeah.|S|Bmr024
me018|that's what i thought.|S|Bmr024
me011|so|F|Bmr024
me018|it's probably just you know huh somehow the audio device gets hung for a second.|S|Bmr024
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn014|some latency or something.|S|Bmr024
me011|hiccups.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me018|or|F|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|D|Bmr024
fe008|as long as they have one number and they know that there's only one beep maximum that goes with that number.|S|Bmr024
me018|yeah.|S|Bmr024
me011|yeah.|F|Bmr024
me011|the only the only part that might be confusing is when chuck is reading digits.|S|Bmr024
me018|right.|B|Bmr024
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr024
me018|right.|B|Bmr024
me018|so|D|Bmr024
fe008|well you know actually are we having them|D|Bmr024
me011|seven four eight beep seven beep eight three two.|S|Bmr024
fe008|yeah but are we having them do digits?|Q|Bmr024
me011|yes.|S|Bmr024
me011|because uh we don't we didn't in order to cut them out we'd have to listen to it.|S|Bmr024
me018|we we didn't cut those out.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn014|they are not transcribed yet.|S|Bmr024
mn014|so|F|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|F|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|and we wanted to avoid doing that.|S|Bmr024
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr024
me011|so we they are transcribing the digits.|S|Bmr024
fe008|okay.|D|Bmr024
fe008|okay.|D|Bmr024
me011|although we could tell them we could tell them if you hear someone reading a digits string just say bracket digit bracket.|S|Bmr024
me018|we can we can ignore it when we get it back.|S|Bmr024
me018|huh.|B|Bmr024
me011|and don't bother actually computing the writing down the digits.|S|Bmr024
me018|yeah.|S|Bmr024
fe008|that'd be great.|S|Bmr024
fe008|that'd be what i'm having the transcribers here do because it can be extracted later.|S|Bmr024
me011|yep.|B|Bmr024
me011|and then i wanted to talk about but as i said i we may not have time what we should do about digits.|S|Bmr024
me011|we have a whole pile of digits that haven't been transcribed.|S|Bmr024
me013|let's talk about it.|S|Bmr024
me013|because that's that's something that i i know andreas is less interested in than liz is.|S|Bmr024
me011|okay.|S|Bmr024
me013|so you know.|F|Bmr024
me011|do we have anything else to say about transcription?|Q|Bmr024
me013|it's good.|D|Bmr024
me011|about i b m stuff?|Q|Bmr024
me018|uh brian i i sent bresset sent brian a message about the meeting.|S|Bmr024
me018|and i haven't heard back yet.|S|Bmr024
me018|so i hope he got it and hopefully he's|D|Bmr024
me011|okay.|B|Bmr024
fe008|huh.|D|Bmr024
me018|maybe he's gone.|S|Bmr024
me018|i don't know.|S|Bmr024
me018|he didn't even reply to my message.|S|Bmr024
me018|so i should probably ping him just to make sure that he got it.|S|Bmr024
me011|all right.|B|Bmr024
me011|so we have a whole bunch of digits.|S|Bmr024
me011|if we want to move on to digits.|S|Bmr024
me013|actually maybe i one one more related thing in transcription.|S|Bmr024
me013|so that's the i b m stuff.|S|Bmr024
me013|we've got that sorted out.|S|Bmr024
me013|um how're we doing on the on the rest of it?|Q|Bmr024
fe008|we're doing well.|S|Bmr024
fe008|i i hire i've hired two extra people already expect to hire two more.|S|Bmr024
me011|huh.|D|Bmr024
fe008|and um i've prepared um uh a set of five which i'm which i'm calling set two.|S|Bmr024
fe008|which are now being edited by my head transcriber in terms of spelling errors and all that.|S|Bmr024
fe008|she's also checking through and and and monitoring um the transcription of another transcriber.|S|Bmr024
fe008|you know i mean she's going through and doing these kinds of checks.|S|Bmr024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
fe008|and i've moved on now to what i'm calling set three.|S|Bmr024
fe008|i sort of thought if i do it in sets groups of five then i can have like sort of a a parallel processing through through the the current.|S|Bmr024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
fe008|and and you indicated to me that we have a a goal now for the for the um the uh darpa demo of twenty hours.|S|Bmr024
fe008|so i'm going to go up to twenty hours be sure that everything gets processed and released and and that's that's what my goal is.|S|Bmr024
fe008|package of twenty hours right now and then once that's done move on to the next.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah uh|F|Bmr024
me013|so twenty hours.|S|Bmr024
me013|but i guess the other thing is that um that that's kind of twenty hours a. sap because the longer before the demo we actually have the twenty hours the more time it'll be for people to actually do cool things with it.|S|Bmr024
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
me013|so okay.|B|Bmr024
fe008|good.|F|Bmr024
fe008|i'm i'm hiring people who uh really are|D|Bmr024
fe008|they would like to do it full time several of these people.|S|Bmr024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
fe008|and and i don't think it's possible really to do this full time but that what it shows is motivation to do as many hours as possible.|S|Bmr024
me011|it'll keep your accuracy up.|S|Bmr024
me011|yep.|B|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
fe008|and they're really excellent.|S|Bmr024
me013|well that's good.|S|Bmr024
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|yeah i mean i guess the so the difference if if um if the i b m stuff works out the difference in the job would be that they primarily would be checking through things that were already done by someone else?|Q|Bmr024
fe008|got a good core group now.|S|Bmr024
fe008|again.|S|Bmr024
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
me013|is that most of what it|D|Bmr024
me011|and correcting.|S|Bmr024
me013|i mean correcting.|S|Bmr024
me011|correcting.|S|Bmr024
me011|we'll we'll expect that they'll have to move some time bins and do some corrections.|S|Bmr024
fe008|and i you know i've also uh discovered|D|Bmr024
fe008|so with the new transcriber i'm|D|Bmr024
fe008|um|F|Bmr024
fe008|so|F|Bmr024
fe008|uh let me say that my|D|Bmr024
fe008|uh|F|Bmr024
fe008|so um|F|Bmr024
fe008|at present um the people have been doing these transcriptions a channel at a time.|S|Bmr024
fe008|and that sort of um is useful.|S|Bmr024
fe008|and you know and then once in a while they'll have to refer to the other channels to clear something up.|S|Bmr024
fe008|okay.|F|Bmr024
fe008|well i realize that um we're using the pre segmented version.|S|Bmr024
fe008|and um the pre segmented version is extremely useful.|S|Bmr024
fe008|and wouldn't it be useful also to have the visual representation of those segments?|Q|Bmr024
fe008|and so i've uh i uh uh i've trained the new one uh the the newest one to um use the visual from the channel that is going to be transcribed at any given time.|S|Bmr024
fe008|and that's just amazingly helpful.|S|Bmr024
fe008|because what happens then is you scan across the signal and once in a while you'll find a blip that didn't show up in the pre segmentation.|S|Bmr024
me011|oh right.|B|Bmr024
me011|i see what you mean.|S|Bmr024
fe008|and that'll be something like it's it's interesting.|S|Bmr024
me011|a backchannel or|D|Bmr024
fe008|once in a while it's a backchannel.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr024
fe008|sometimes it seems to be um similar to the ones that are being picked up.|S|Bmr024
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
fe008|and they're rare events but you can really go through a meeting very quickly.|S|Bmr024
fe008|you just you just you know you you scroll from screen to screen looking for blips.|S|Bmr024
fe008|and i think that we're going to end up with uh better coverage of the backchannels.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
fe008|but at the same time we're benefitting tremendously from the pre segmentation.|S|Bmr024
fe008|because there are huge places where there is just absolutely no activity at all.|S|Bmr024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
fe008|and uh the audio quality is so good.|S|Bmr024
me018|so they can they can um scroll through that pretty quick?|Q|Bmr024
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr024
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Bmr024
me018|that's great.|S|Bmr024
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr024
fe008|so i think that that's going to also uh you know speed the efficiency of this part of the process.|S|Bmr024
me013|huh.|B|Bmr024
me013|okay.|S|Bmr024
me013|uh yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|so uh|F|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr024
me013|so let's talk about the digits since they're not here yet.|S|Bmr024
me011|uh so we have a whole bunch of digits that we've read and we have the forms and so on.|S|Bmr024
me011|um but only a small number of that|D|Bmr024
me011|well not a small number.|S|Bmr024
me011|only a subset of that has been transcribed.|S|Bmr024
me011|and so we need to decide what we want to do.|S|Bmr024
me011|and uh liz and andreas actually they're not here but they did say at one point that they thought they could do a pretty good job of just doing a forced alignment.|S|Bmr024
me011|and again i don't think we'll be able to do with that alone because um sometimes people correct themselves and things like that.|S|Bmr024
me011|but|F|Bmr024
me011|so i was just wondering what people thought about how automated can we make the process of finding where the people read the digits doing a forced alignment and doing the timing.|S|Bmr024
me013|well forced alignment would be one thing.|S|Bmr024
me013|what about just actually doing recognition?|Q|Bmr024
me011|well we we know what they read because we have the forms.|S|Bmr024
me013|no they make mistakes.|S|Bmr024
me011|right.|S|Bmr024
me011|but the point is that we want to get a set of clean digits.|S|Bmr024
me013|right.|S|Bmr024
me018|you're talking about as a pre processing step.|S|Bmr024
me018|right morgan?|Q|Bmr024
me013|um|F|Bmr024
me018|is that what you're|D|Bmr024
me013|yeah i'm i'm not quite sure what i'm talking about.|S|Bmr024
me013|i mean i|D|Bmr024
me013|i mean uh we're talking about digits now.|S|Bmr024
me013|and and so um there's a bunch of stuff that hasn't been marked yet.|S|Bmr024
me013|uh.|F|Bmr024
me013|and um there's the issue that that they we know what what was said but do we?|Q|Bmr024
me011|i mean so one option|D|Bmr024
me013|because people make mistakes and stuff.|S|Bmr024
me013|i was just asking just out of curiosity if if with uh uh the s r i recognizer getting one percent word error.|S|Bmr024
me013|uh would we would we do better?|Q|Bmr024
me013|so if you do a forced alignment but the but the but the transcription you have is wrong because they actually made mistakes uh or false starts it's it's much less it's much less common than one percent?|Q|Bmr024
me011|but that's pretty uncommon.|S|Bmr024
me011|um if we could really get one percent on|D|Bmr024
me011|well i guess yeah i guess if we segmented it we could get one percent on digits.|S|Bmr024
me013|we should be able to.|S|Bmr024
me013|right?|Q|Bmr024
me018|yeah.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|so that's just my question.|S|Bmr024
me011|but|F|Bmr024
me013|i'm not saying it should be one way or the other but it's if|D|Bmr024
me011|well there there're a couple different ways of doing it.|S|Bmr024
me011|we could use the tools i've already developed and transcribe it.|S|Bmr024
me011|hire some people or use the transcribers to do it.|S|Bmr024
me011|we could let i b m transcribe it.|S|Bmr024
me011|you know they're doing it anyway.|S|Bmr024
me011|and unless we tell them different they're going to transcribe it.|S|Bmr024
me011|um or we could try some automated methods.|S|Bmr024
me011|and my my tendency right now is well if i b m comes back with this meeting and the transcript is good just let them do it.|S|Bmr024
me013|well|F|Bmr024
me013|yeah it's you raised a point kind of uh euphemistically.|S|Bmr024
me013|but i mean maybe it is a serious problem.|S|Bmr024
me013|what will they do when they go hear beep seven beep seven three five two?|Q|Bmr024
me013|i mean you think they'll we'll get|D|Bmr024
me011|it's pretty distinct.|S|Bmr024
me011|the beeps are pre recorded.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me018|it'll only be a problem for for mine.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
fe008|well it it well it'd be preceded by i'm reading transcript so-and-so?|Q|Bmr024
me018|yeah.|S|Bmr024
me011|yes.|S|Bmr024
fe008|so i think if they're processing it at|D|Bmr024
me011|i mean it'll be it will be in the midst of a digit string.|S|Bmr024
me011|so|F|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|i mean it|D|Bmr024
me011|sure there there might be a place where it's beep seven beep eight beep eight beep.|S|Bmr024
me011|but you know they they're they're going to macros for inserting the beep marks.|S|Bmr024
me011|and so i i don't think it'll be a problem.|S|Bmr024
me011|we'll have to see.|S|Bmr024
me011|but i don't think it's going to be a problem.|S|Bmr024
me013|okay.|S|Bmr024
me013|well i i i don't know.|S|Bmr024
me013|i i think that that's if they are in fact going to transcribe these things uh certainly any process that we'd have to correct them or whatever is needs to be much less elaborate for digits than for other stuff.|S|Bmr024
me011|right.|S|Bmr024
me013|so why not?|Q|Bmr024
me013|sure.|S|Bmr024
me013|that was it?|Q|Bmr024
me011|that was it.|S|Bmr024
me011|just what do we do with digits.|S|Bmr024
me013|okay.|B|Bmr024
me011|we have so many of them and it'd be nice to actually do something with them.|S|Bmr024
me013|well we we we want to have them.|S|Bmr024
mn017|you mean there're more than ten?|Q|Bmr024
me013|yeah i|D|Bmr024
me011|anything else?|Q|Bmr024
me011|your mike is a little low there.|S|Bmr024
me013|in berkeley yeah.|S|Bmr024
me013|so uh you you have to go a little early.|S|Bmr024
me013|right?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|well i can stay till about uh three forty.|S|Bmr024
me013|at twenty|D|Bmr024
me013|all right.|F|Bmr024
me013|so let's make sure we do the ones that that uh saved you.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
me013|so there was some uh in in adam's agenda list.|S|Bmr024
me013|he had something from you about segmentation this last recognition?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|well yeah.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so this is just partly to inform everybody um and and of course to get um input.|S|Bmr024
me011|oops!|S|Bmr024
mn017|um so uh we had a discussion don and liz and i had discussion last week about how to proceed with uh you know with don's work.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and and and uh one of the obvious things that occur to us was that we're since we now have thilo's segmenter and it works you know amazingly well um we should actually basically re evaluate the recognition um results using you know without cheating on the segmentations.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and that should be fairly|D|Bmr024
mn014|so|F|Bmr024
mn014|and how do we find the transcripts for those so that|D|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|F|Bmr024
mn017|oh okay.|S|Bmr024
mn014|the references for for those segments?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|so there's actually|D|Bmr024
mn014|it's not that|D|Bmr024
mn017|why do you ask?|Q|Bmr024
me011|i could|D|Bmr024
mn017|no actually um nist has um a fairly sophisticated scoring program that you can give a um a time.|S|Bmr024
fe016|well|D|Bmr024
me011|hand ones.|S|Bmr024
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr024
mn017|uh you know you basically just give two time marked sequences of words and it computes the um the uh you know the the|D|Bmr024
me018|it does all the work for you.|S|Bmr024
mn017|it does all the work for you.|S|Bmr024
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn014|okay.|B|Bmr024
mn017|so it we just and we use that actually in hub five to do the scoring.|S|Bmr024
mn017|um so what we've been using so far was sort of a simplified version of the scoring.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and we can we can handle the the the type of problem we have here.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so we|D|Bmr024
mn014|so basically you give some time constraints for for the references and for for the hypothesis.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right.|S|Bmr024
mn014|and|D|Bmr024
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr024
fe016|maybe the start of your speech and the end of it.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah okay.|B|Bmr024
mn017|so|D|Bmr024
fe016|or stuff like that.|S|Bmr024
mn014|okay.|B|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
mn017|it does time constrained word alignment.|S|Bmr024
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so|F|Bmr024
mn017|so that should be possible.|S|Bmr024
mn017|i mean that shouldn't be a problem.|S|Bmr024
mn017|uh so that was the one thing.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and the other was that|D|Bmr024
mn017|um|F|Bmr024
mn017|what was the other problem?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|oh!|S|Bmr024
mn017|that thilo wanted to use the recognizer alignments to train up his um speech detector.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr024
mn017|um so that we could use uh you know there wouldn't be so much hand labelling needed to uh to generate training data for for the speech detector.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr024
mn014|i'm just in progress of of doing that.|S|Bmr024
mn014|so|F|Bmr024
mn017|and i think you're in the process of doing that.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so you can you can|D|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me018|it'll give you a lot more data too.|S|Bmr024
me018|won't it?|Q|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr024
mn014|so it's basically|D|Bmr024
mn014|i think eight meetings or something which which i'm using.|S|Bmr024
mn014|and it's before it was twenty minutes of one meeting.|S|Bmr024
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
mn014|so should be a little bit better.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
mn017|that won't be perfect the alignments aren't perfect.|S|Bmr024
me018|great.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|but um it's probably still better to have all this extra data than|D|Bmr024
mn014|but|D|Bmr024
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn014|we'll see that.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|okay.|B|Bmr024
fe016|actually i had a question about that.|S|Bmr024
fe016|if you find that you can lower the false alarms that you get where there's no speech that would be useful for us to know.|S|Bmr024
fe016|so um|F|Bmr024
mn014|there were the false alarms.|S|Bmr024
fe016|yeah.|F|Bmr024
fe016|so right now you get you know false false uh speech regions when it's just like um breath or something like that.|S|Bmr024
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
fe016|and i'd be interested to know the if you retrain|D|Bmr024
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr024
fe016|um|F|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
fe016|do those actually go down or not?|Q|Bmr024
fe016|because of|D|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr024
mn014|i'll can make can like make a comparison of of the old system to the to the new one.|S|Bmr024
fe016|yeah just to see if by doing nothing in the modeling of just having that training data what happens.|S|Bmr024
mn014|and then|D|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr024
me013|um another one that we had on adam's agenda that definitely involved you was something about smartkom?|Q|Bmr024
me011|right.|S|Bmr024
me011|so rob porzel|D|Bmr024
me011|uh porzel?|Q|Bmr024
me011|and the uh porzel and the uh smartkom group are collecting some dialogues.|S|Bmr024
mn017|porzel.|S|Bmr024
mn017|porzel.|S|Bmr024
me011|basically they have one person sitting in here looking at a picture and a wizard sitting in another room somewhere.|S|Bmr024
me011|and uh they're doing a travel task.|S|Bmr024
me011|and uh it involves starting i believe starting with a|D|Bmr024
me011|it's it's always the wizard.|S|Bmr024
me011|but it starts where the wizard is pretending to be a computer and it goes through a uh speech generation system.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|D|Bmr024
mn014|actually it's changed to a synthesis for for the first part now.|S|Bmr024
me011|synthesis system.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|um and then it goes to a real wizard and they're evaluating that.|S|Bmr024
me011|and they wanted to use this equipment and so the question came up is|D|Bmr024
me011|well here's some more data.|S|Bmr024
me011|should this be part of the corpus or not?|Q|Bmr024
me011|and my attitude was yes because there might be people who are using this corpus for acoustics as opposed to just for language.|S|Bmr024
me011|um or also for dialogue of various sorts.|S|Bmr024
me011|um so it's not a meeting.|S|Bmr024
me011|right?|Q|Bmr024
me011|because it's two people and they're not face to face.|S|Bmr024
me013|wait a minute.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|so i just wanted to understand it because i i'm uh hadn't quite followed this process.|S|Bmr024
me013|um so it's wizard in the usual sense that the person who is asking the questions doesn't know that it's uh a not a machine?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
mn017|actually actually the the we do this|D|Bmr024
me011|at the beginning.|S|Bmr024
mn017|i don't know who came up with it but i think it's a really clever idea.|S|Bmr024
mn017|we simulate a computer breakdown halfway through the session and so then after that the person's told that they're now talking to a uh to a human.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr024
mn014|it's a human operator.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|but of course they don't know that it's the same person both times.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so we we collect we collect both human computer and human human data essentially in the same session.|S|Bmr024
me013|you might want to try collecting it the other way around sometime saying that the computer isn't up yet.|S|Bmr024
fe008|huh.|B|Bmr024
me013|and then so then you can separate it out whether it's the beginning or end kind of effects.|S|Bmr024
mn017|that's an idea.|S|Bmr024
me013|but|F|Bmr024
me011|yep.|B|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
fe008|that's a good idea.|D|Bmr024
me011|i have to go now.|S|Bmr024
me011|you can talk to the computer.|S|Bmr024
me018|it's a lot more believable too.|S|Bmr024
me011|no!|S|Bmr024
me018|if you tell them that they're the computer part is running on a windows machine.|S|Bmr024
me018|and the whole breakdown thing kind of makes sense.|S|Bmr024
mn017|just just reboot it.|S|Bmr024
me011|abort|D|Bmr024
me011|abort retry fail?|Q|Bmr024
fe016|so did they actually save the far field data?|Q|Bmr024
fe016|because at first they weren't they weren't|D|Bmr024
me011|well this was this was the question.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yes.|B|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|so so they were saying they were not going to.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
fe016|okay.|B|Bmr024
me011|and i said well that's silly if if we're going to try to do it for a corpus there might be people who are interested in acoustics.|S|Bmr024
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|wow!|D|Bmr024
mn014|no.|B|Bmr024
fe016|or|D|Bmr024
mn014|projector we were not saying we are not doing it.|S|Bmr024
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|no the the question is do we save one or two far field channels or all of them?|Q|Bmr024
mn014|we we just wanted to do|D|Bmr024
fe016|right.|B|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|i i see no reason not to do all of them.|S|Bmr024
me011|that that if we have someone who is doing acoustic studies uh it's nice to have the same for every recording.|S|Bmr024
me013|um|F|Bmr024
fe016|nnn.|D|Bmr024
mn017|huh.|D|Bmr024
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|so what is the purpose of this recording?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|uhhuh.|D|Bmr024
me013|this is to get acoustic and language model training data for smartkom.|S|Bmr024
mn017|it's to be to training data and development data for the smartkom system.|S|Bmr024
mn014|the english system?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|right.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right.|S|Bmr024
me013|okay.|S|Bmr024
me018|where does this|D|Bmr024
fe016|maybe we can have him vary the microphones too.|S|Bmr024
me013|well|F|Bmr024
fe016|or they're different speakers.|S|Bmr024
me011|right.|F|Bmr024
me011|so so so for their usage they don't need anything.|S|Bmr024
me013|so why not|D|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|F|Bmr024
mn014|but but i'm not sure about the legal aspect of of that.|S|Bmr024
me011|right?|Q|Bmr024
mn014|is is there some contract with smartkom or something about the data?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn014|what they|D|Bmr024
mn014|or is is that our data which we are collecting here?|Q|Bmr024
me013|we've never signed anything that said that we couldn't use anything that we did.|S|Bmr024
mn014|or|D|Bmr024
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr024
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr024
mn017|we weren't supposed to collect any data.|S|Bmr024
mn014|so|B|Bmr024
mn014|okay.|F|Bmr024
mn017|this was all|D|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn014|so yeah that was the question.|S|Bmr024
mn014|if if|D|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn014|basically.|S|Bmr024
me013|no that's not a problem.|S|Bmr024
me013|i look it seems to me that if we're doing it anyway and we're doing it for these these purposes that we have and we have these distant mikes we definitely should should save it all as long as we've got disk space.|S|Bmr024
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
me013|and disk is pretty cheap.|S|Bmr024
mn017|okay.|S|Bmr024
me013|so should we save it?|Q|Bmr024
me011|and then|D|Bmr024
me013|now|D|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr024
me013|so we save it because it's it it's potentially useful.|S|Bmr024
me011|right.|S|Bmr024
me013|and now what do we do with it is is a separate question.|S|Bmr024
me013|i mean anybody who's training something up could choose to put it uh to include this or not.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right.|D|Bmr024
me013|i i would not say it was part of the meetings corpus.|S|Bmr024
me013|it isn't.|S|Bmr024
me013|but it's some other data we have.|S|Bmr024
me013|and if somebody doing experiment wants to train up including that then they can.|S|Bmr024
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
me013|right?|Q|Bmr024
me011|so it's it it i guess it the begs the question of what is the meeting corpus.|S|Bmr024
me011|so if at u w they start recording two person hallway conversations is that part of the meeting corpus?|Q|Bmr024
me013|i think it's i i think i think the idea of two or more people conversing with one another is key.|S|Bmr024
me011|well this has two or more people conversing with each other.|S|Bmr024
me013|nnn well|F|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|they're just not face to face.|S|Bmr024
fe016|what if we just give it a a name like we give these meetings a name?|Q|Bmr024
fe008|well this|D|Bmr024
me013|no it doesn't.|S|Bmr024
me013|right?|Q|Bmr024
me013|it has|D|Bmr024
me011|i mean that was my intention.|S|Bmr024
fe016|and then later on some people will consider it a meeting and some people won't.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|that was my intention.|S|Bmr024
fe008|well this|D|Bmr024
fe016|and|F|Bmr024
me011|so so so part of the reason that i wanted to bring this up is do we want to handle it as a special case or do we want to fold it in?|Q|Bmr024
fe016|just give it a title.|S|Bmr024
fe008|oh.|B|Bmr024
me013|i think it is a|D|Bmr024
me011|give everyone who's involved as their own user i d give it session i ds let all the tools that handle meeting recorder handle it or do we want to special case it?|Q|Bmr024
me011|and if we were going to special case it who's going to do that?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|well it it makes sense to handle it with the same infrastructure since we don't want to duplicate things unnecessarily.|S|Bmr024
mn014|so|F|Bmr024
mn014|it it it|D|Bmr024
fe008|i think|D|Bmr024
mn017|but as far as distributing it we shouldn't label it as part of this meeting corpus.|S|Bmr024
mn017|we should let it be its own|D|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr024
me011|i don't see why not.|S|Bmr024
fe008|well it's it well because|D|Bmr024
me011|it's just a different topic.|S|Bmr024
fe008|i i have an extra point which is the naturalness issue.|S|Bmr024
fe008|because we have like meetings that have a reason.|S|Bmr024
fe008|that's one of the reasons that we were talking about this.|S|Bmr024
fe008|and and those and this sounds like it's more of an experimental setup.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|it's scenario based it's it's human computer interface it's really pretty different.|S|Bmr024
fe008|it's got a different purpose.|S|Bmr024
me013|but i i have no problem with somebody folding it in for some experiment they're going to do.|S|Bmr024
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|but i don't think it it doesn't match anything that we've described about meetings.|S|Bmr024
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
me013|whereas everything that we talked about them doing at at u w and so forth really does.|S|Bmr024
me011|okay.|F|Bmr024
me013|they're actually talking|D|Bmr024
me011|so so what does that mean for how we are going to organize things?|Q|Bmr024
fe008|huh.|B|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|you can you can|D|Bmr024
me013|again as as i think andreas was saying if you want to use the same tools and the same conventions there's no problem with that.|S|Bmr024
me013|it's just that it's you know different directory it's called something different it's|D|Bmr024
me013|you know|F|Bmr024
me013|it is different.|S|Bmr024
me013|you can't just fold it in as if it's|D|Bmr024
me013|i mean digits are different too.|S|Bmr024
me013|right?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|it might also be potentially confusing.|S|Bmr024
me011|yeah but those are folded in.|S|Bmr024
me011|and it's just you just mark the transcripts differently.|S|Bmr024
me011|so so one option is you fold it in.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
me011|and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction rather than another type of interaction.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah i|D|Bmr024
me013|well i i wouldn't call reading digits meetings.|S|Bmr024
me013|right?|Q|Bmr024
me013|i mean we we we were doing|D|Bmr024
me011|well but but i put it under the same directory tree.|S|Bmr024
me011|you know it's in user doctor speech data m r.|S|Bmr024
me013|well|F|Bmr024
fe016|can we just have a directory called like other stuff?|Q|Bmr024
fe016|and|F|Bmr024
me011|other.|S|Bmr024
fe016|well or i don't know.|S|Bmr024
me013|i mean i don't care what directory tree you have it under.|S|Bmr024
fe016|and and just um store it there.|S|Bmr024
me013|right?|Q|Bmr024
me013|i mean that's just a|D|Bmr024
me011|okay.|F|Bmr024
me011|my preference is to have a single procedure so that i don't have to think too much about things.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yes.|D|Bmr024
fe016|i mean|F|Bmr024
me011|and just have a marking.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|if we do it any other way that means that we need a separate procedure and someone has to do that.|S|Bmr024
me013|o you you can use whatever procedure you want that's convenient for you.|S|Bmr024
me013|all i'm saying is that there's no way that we're going to tell people that reading digits is meetings.|S|Bmr024
me011|right.|S|Bmr024
me013|and similarly we're not going to tell them that someone talking to a computer to get travel information is meetings.|S|Bmr024
me013|those aren't meetings.|S|Bmr024
me013|but if it makes it easier for you to fold them in the same procedures and have them under the same directory tree knock yourself out.|S|Bmr024
me013|you know?|Q|Bmr024
me018|there's a couple other questions that i have too.|S|Bmr024
me018|and and one of them is what about uh consent issues?|Q|Bmr024
me018|and the other one is what about transcription?|Q|Bmr024
mn014|transcription is done in munich.|S|Bmr024
me018|are|D|Bmr024
me018|okay.|S|Bmr024
me018|so we don't have to worry about transcribing it?|Q|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr024
me013|all right.|B|Bmr024
me011|so we will have to worry about format.|S|Bmr024
mn017|that's a that's another argument to keep it separate.|S|Bmr024
mn017|because it's going to follow the smartkom transcription conventions and not the icsi meeting transcription conventions.|S|Bmr024
me011|oh okay.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|uh.|B|Bmr024
me011|okay.|F|Bmr024
me011|well i didn't realize that.|S|Bmr024
me013|good point.|S|Bmr024
me011|that's that's a|D|Bmr024
me013|good point.|S|Bmr024
me013|but i'm sure no one would have a problem with our folding it in for some acoustic modeling or or some things.|S|Bmr024
me013|um.|F|Bmr024
me013|do we do we have uh um american born folk uh reading german german uh uh place names and so forth?|Q|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr024
me013|is that|D|Bmr024
mn017|exactly.|S|Bmr024
me011|yep.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah great.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|they they even have a reading list.|S|Bmr024
me018|i bet that sounds good.|S|Bmr024
me011|it's pretty funny.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me018|huh?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn014|you can do that if you want.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me018|okay.|B|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me018|i don't know if you want that.|S|Bmr024
me013|right.|B|Bmr024
me011|so|F|Bmr024
fe008|huh.|B|Bmr024
me013|heidelberg.|S|Bmr024
mn017|exactly.|S|Bmr024
me011|disk might eventually be an issue so we might we we might need to uh get some more disk pretty soon.|S|Bmr024
mn017|do you want to be a subject?|Q|Bmr024
me013|yeah i be pretty good.|S|Bmr024
mn017|we|D|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|we're about we're about half halfway through our disk right now.|S|Bmr024
mn017|that was one of our concerns.|S|Bmr024
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me018|are we only half?|Q|Bmr024
me018|i thought we were more than that.|S|Bmr024
me011|we're probably a little more than that because we're using up some space that we shouldn't be on.|S|Bmr024
me011|so once everything gets converted over to the disks we're supposed to be using we'll be probably uh seventy five percent.|S|Bmr024
me018|well when i was looking for space for thilo i found one disk that had uh i think it was nine gigs and another one had seventeen.|S|Bmr024
me011|yep.|S|Bmr024
me018|and everything else was sort of committed.|S|Bmr024
me018|uh.|F|Bmr024
me011|were those backed up or non backed up?|Q|Bmr024
me018|those were non backed up.|S|Bmr024
mn014|non back up.|S|Bmr024
me011|right.|S|Bmr024
me011|so that's different.|S|Bmr024
me018|oh you're talking about backed up.|S|Bmr024
me011|i'm much more concerned about the backed up.|S|Bmr024
me011|the non backed up.|S|Bmr024
me018|i haven't looked to see how much of that we have.|S|Bmr024
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|is cheap.|S|Bmr024
me011|i mean if we need to we can buy a disk hang it off a uh workstation.|S|Bmr024
me011|if it's not backed up the sysadmins don't care too much.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|so i mean pretty much anytime we need a disk we can get it at the rate that we're|D|Bmr024
mn017|you can|D|Bmr024
mn017|i shouldn't be saying this but you can just you know since the back ups are every night you can recycle the backed up diskspace.|S|Bmr024
me011|yeah.|F|Bmr024
me011|but that's that's that's risky.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah you really shouldn't be saying|D|Bmr024
me011|huh.|B|Bmr024
mn017|i didn't say that.|S|Bmr024
me011|huh.|B|Bmr024
me011|yeah that's right.|S|Bmr024
mn017|i didn't say that.|D|Bmr024
me011|beep that out.|S|Bmr024
me013|we had allowed dave to listen to these these uh recordings.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
me013|um yeah.|F|Bmr024
me013|i and there's been this conversation going on about getting another file server.|S|Bmr024
me013|and and we can do that.|S|Bmr024
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
me013|we'll take the opportunity and get another big raft of of disk i guess.|S|Bmr024
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|well i think i think there's an argument for having you know you could use our old file server for for disks that have data that is very rarely accessed.|S|Bmr024
me011|it's really the back up issue rather than the file server issue.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and then have a fast new file server for data that is um heavily accessed.|S|Bmr024
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|my understanding is the issue isn't really the file server.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|we could always put more disks on.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|it's the it's the back up|D|Bmr024
me011|it's the back up system.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|so|F|Bmr024
me011|which is near saturation apparently.|S|Bmr024
me011|so|F|Bmr024
me013|soon.|S|Bmr024
me018|i think i think the file server could become an issue as we get a whole bunch more new compute machines.|S|Bmr024
me018|and we've got you know fifty machines trying to access data off of abbott at once.|S|Bmr024
me011|well we're all right for now.|S|Bmr024
me011|because the network's so slow.|S|Bmr024
mn017|i mean i think i think we've raised this before and someone said this is not a reliable way to do it.|S|Bmr024
mn017|but the|D|Bmr024
mn017|what about putting the stuff on like c c d rom or d v d or something?|Q|Bmr024
me011|yeah.|F|Bmr024
me011|that was me.|S|Bmr024
me011|i was the one who said it was not reliable.|S|Bmr024
mn017|okay.|S|Bmr024
me011|they they wear out.|S|Bmr024
mn017|oh okay.|S|Bmr024
me011|yeah.|F|Bmr024
me011|the the|D|Bmr024
mn017|but they wear out just from sitting on the shelf?|Q|Bmr024
me011|yep.|S|Bmr024
me011|absolutely.|S|Bmr024
mn017|or from being read and read?|Q|Bmr024
me011|no.|S|Bmr024
me011|read and write don't hurt them too much unless you scratch them.|S|Bmr024
mn017|oh okay.|S|Bmr024
me011|but the the write once and the read writes don't last.|S|Bmr024
me011|so you don't you don't want to put reproduceable data on them.|S|Bmr024
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
me018|wear out after what amount of time?|Q|Bmr024
me011|year or two.|S|Bmr024
fe008|would it be|D|Bmr024
me013|year or two?|Q|Bmr024
me011|yep.|S|Bmr024
me013|wow!|S|Bmr024
fe008|huh.|B|Bmr024
mn017|but if that|D|Bmr024
mn017|then you would think you'd hear much more clamoring about data loss.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|and|F|Bmr024
me013|i mean yeah all the l|D|Bmr024
me011|i i don't know many people who do it on c d.|S|Bmr024
me011|i mean they're the most|D|Bmr024
me013|l d all the l d c distributions are on c d rom.|S|Bmr024
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr024
me011|they're on c d but they're not that's not the only source.|S|Bmr024
fe016|like|D|Bmr024
me011|they have them on disk.|S|Bmr024
me011|and they burn new ones every once in a while.|S|Bmr024
mn017|but you know we have|D|Bmr024
me011|but if you go if you go|D|Bmr024
fe016|but we have like thirty you know from ten years ago?|Q|Bmr024
fe016|no.|S|Bmr024
me013|we have all sorts of c d roms from a long time ago.|S|Bmr024
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
fe016|ten years ago.|S|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|D|Bmr024
me011|well|F|Bmr024
me011|okay.|D|Bmr024
fe016|ninety one.|S|Bmr024
fe016|and they're still all fine.|S|Bmr024
me001|were they burned or were they pressed?|Q|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
fe016|uh both.|S|Bmr024
fe016|i've burned them and they're still okay.|S|Bmr024
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr024
fe016|i mean usually they're|D|Bmr024
me011|the the pressed ones last|D|Bmr024
me011|well not forever.|S|Bmr024
me011|they've been finding even those degrade.|S|Bmr024
me013|oh i see.|S|Bmr024
me011|but uh the burned ones|D|Bmr024
me011|i mean when i say two or three years what i'm saying is that i have had disks which are gone in a year.|S|Bmr024
fe016|that's what i|D|Bmr024
me011|on the average it'll probably be three or four years.|S|Bmr024
me011|but uh i i you don't want to have your only copy on a media that fails.|S|Bmr024
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr024
me011|and they do.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so how about|D|Bmr024
me011|um if you have them professionally pressed you know they're good for decades.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so so how about putting them on that plus like on a on on dat or some other medium that isn't risky?|Q|Bmr024
me011|i think|D|Bmr024
me011|um|F|Bmr024
me011|we can already put them on tape.|S|Bmr024
mn017|okay.|S|Bmr024
me011|and the tape is is very reliable.|S|Bmr024
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
me011|so the the only issue is then if we need access to them.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
me011|so that's fine if we don't need access to them.|S|Bmr024
mn017|well if if if you if they last|D|Bmr024
mn017|say they actually last like five years huh in in the typical case.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and and occasionally you might need to re create one.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and then you get your tape out but otherwise you don't.|S|Bmr024
mn017|can't you just|D|Bmr024
mn017|you just put them on|D|Bmr024
me001|so you just archive it on the tape and then put it on c d as well?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right.|S|Bmr024
me011|oh.|S|Bmr024
me011|so you're just saying put them on c ds for normal access.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
me001|yeah.|S|Bmr024
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|i mean you can do that.|S|Bmr024
me018|what you|D|Bmr024
me011|but that's pretty annoying.|S|Bmr024
me011|because the c ds are so slow.|S|Bmr024
fe016|see|D|Bmr024
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr024
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me018|what'd be nice is a system that re burned the c ds every year.|S|Bmr024
fe016|every time it was a going to going to die.|S|Bmr024
me011|well i mean the c ds are are an|D|Bmr024
me013|well|B|Bmr024
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|it's like like dynamic d ram.|S|Bmr024
mn014|just before.|S|Bmr024
fe016|just before before it goes bad it burns them in.|S|Bmr024
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|the the c d is an alternative to tape.|S|Bmr024
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|icsi already has a perfectly good tape system and it's more reliable.|S|Bmr024
me013|you know i would think|D|Bmr024
me011|so for archiving we'll just use tape.|S|Bmr024
mn017|one one thing i don't understand is if you have the data if if if the meeting data is put on disk exactly once then it's backed up once and the back up system should never have to bother with it uh more than once.|S|Bmr024
me011|well regardless|D|Bmr024
me011|well first of all there was um a problem with the archive in that i was every once in a while doing a chmod on all the directories or recursive chmod and chown.|S|Bmr024
me011|because they weren't getting set correctly every once in a while.|S|Bmr024
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
me011|and i was just doing a minus r star not realizing that that caused it to be re backed up.|S|Bmr024
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
fe016|uh|B|Bmr024
me011|but normally you're correct.|S|Bmr024
me011|but even without that the back up system is becoming saturated.|S|Bmr024
mn017|but but this back up system is smart enough to figure out that something hasn't changed and doesn't need to be backed up again.|S|Bmr024
me011|sure but we still have enough changed that the nightly back ups are starting to take too long.|S|Bmr024
me013|the i think the at least the once that you put it on it would it would kill that.|S|Bmr024
mn017|okay.|F|Bmr024
mn017|so so then if so so then let's|D|Bmr024
me011|it has nothing to do with the meeting.|S|Bmr024
me013|so|B|Bmr024
me011|it's just the general icsi back up system is becoming saturated.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right.|S|Bmr024
mn017|okay.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so what if we buy uh uh what what do they call these um high density|D|Bmr024
me011|well why don't you have this have a this conversation with dave johnson rather than with me?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|no no.|S|Bmr024
mn017|because this is maybe something that we can do without involving dave and and putting more burden on him.|S|Bmr024
mn017|how about we buy uh uh uh one of these high density tape drives?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|and we put the data actually on non backed up disks.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and we do our own back up once and for all all and then and we don't have to bother this up.|S|Bmr024
me011|actually you know we could do that just with the tape with the current tape.|S|Bmr024
mn017|i don't know what these tapes.|S|Bmr024
mn017|uh|F|Bmr024
mn017|at some point these|D|Bmr024
mn017|i don't know.|S|Bmr024
mn017|what kind of tape drive is it?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|is it is|D|Bmr024
me011|i don't know but it's an automatic robot so it's very convenient.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
me011|you just run a program to restore them.|S|Bmr024
me013|the the one that we have?|Q|Bmr024
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr024
mn017|but it might interfere with their back up schedule.|S|Bmr024
me013|the i mean|D|Bmr024
fe016|but|F|Bmr024
me013|no we have we don't we have our own?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|uh.|B|Bmr024
me013|something that doesn't that isn't used by the back up gang?|Q|Bmr024
me013|don't we have something downstairs?|Q|Bmr024
fe008|well they|D|Bmr024
me018|what kind of tape drive?|Q|Bmr024
me013|just in|D|Bmr024
me011|well|F|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr024
me011|but|F|Bmr024
me011|no.|F|Bmr024
me011|but andreas's point is a good one.|S|Bmr024
me011|and we don't have to do anything ourselves to do that.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
me011|they're already right now on tape.|S|Bmr024
me011|right?|Q|Bmr024
me011|so your your point is and i think it's a good one that we could just get more disk and put it there.|S|Bmr024
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr024
mn017|on an x h uh x x whatever partition.|S|Bmr024
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr024
me011|that's not a bad idea.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|yeah that's basically what i was going to say is that a disk is is so cheap it's essentially you know close to free.|S|Bmr024
me011|so once it's on tape|D|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
me013|and the only thing that costs is the back up issue uh to first order.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
me013|and we can take care of that by putting it on non back up drives and just backing it up once onto this tape.|S|Bmr024
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
me011|i think that's a good idea.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
me013|oh.|B|Bmr024
mn017|okay.|B|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|good.|B|Bmr024
me013|it's good.|B|Bmr024
fe016|so who's going to do these back ups?|Q|Bmr024
fe016|the people that collect it?|Q|Bmr024
me011|uh|F|Bmr024
me011|well i'll talk to dave and and see what how what the best way of doing that is.|S|Bmr024
me018|it's probably going to|D|Bmr024
me011|there's a little utility that will manually burn a tape for you.|S|Bmr024
me011|and that's probably the right way to do it.|S|Bmr024
me018|yeah and we should probably make that part of the procedure for recording the meetings.|S|Bmr024
fe016|well|D|Bmr024
me011|yep.|B|Bmr024
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr024
fe016|that's what i'm wondering.|S|Bmr024
fe016|if|D|Bmr024
me011|well we're we're going to automate that.|S|Bmr024
fe016|okay.|B|Bmr024
me011|my intention is to do a script that'll do everything.|S|Bmr024
fe016|i mean you don't have to physically put a tape in the drive?|Q|Bmr024
me011|no.|S|Bmr024
fe016|or|D|Bmr024
fe016|oh okay.|S|Bmr024
me011|it's all tape robot.|S|Bmr024
fe016|so it's just|D|Bmr024
me011|so you just sit down at your computer and you type a command.|S|Bmr024
fe016|oh okay.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah but then you're effectively using the resources of the back up system.|S|Bmr024
mn017|or is that a different tape robot?|Q|Bmr024
fe016|but not at the same time.|S|Bmr024
me011|yeah.|F|Bmr024
me011|but but you would be anyway.|S|Bmr024
mn017|no no.|F|Bmr024
me011|right?|Q|Bmr024
me018|no no no.|S|Bmr024
me011|because|D|Bmr024
mn017|see|D|Bmr024
me018|he's saying get a whole different drive.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah just give a|D|Bmr024
me011|but there's no reason to do that.|S|Bmr024
mn017|well i'm saying is if you go to dave and and and ask him can i use your tape robot.|S|Bmr024
me011|it we already have it there and it it's|D|Bmr024
mn017|he will say well that's going to screw up our back up operation.|S|Bmr024
me011|no we won't.|S|Bmr024
me011|he'll say if if that means that it's not going to be backed up standardly great.|S|Bmr024
me013|i dave has has promoted this in the past.|S|Bmr024
me013|so i don't think he's actually against it.|S|Bmr024
me011|yeah.|F|Bmr024
me011|it's it's definitely no problem.|S|Bmr024
mn017|oh okay.|S|Bmr024
mn017|all right.|B|Bmr024
mn017|all right.|B|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr024
mn017|good.|S|Bmr024
me013|okay.|B|Bmr024
fe016|what about if the times overlap with the normal back up time?|Q|Bmr024
me011|um it's it's just it's just a utility which queues up.|S|Bmr024
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr024
me011|it just queues it up and and when it's available it will copy it.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|and then you can tell it to then remove it from the disk or you can you know do it a few days later or whatever you want to do.|S|Bmr024
me011|after you confirm that it's really backed up.|S|Bmr024
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr024
me011|n w|D|Bmr024
fe008|you saying n w archive?|Q|Bmr024
me011|n w archive.|S|Bmr024
me011|that's what it is.|S|Bmr024
fe008|yep and if you did that during the day it would never make it to the nightly back ups.|S|Bmr024
me013|okay.|B|Bmr024
me011|right.|S|Bmr024
fe008|and then there wouldn't be this extra load.|S|Bmr024
mn017|well it if he you have to put the data on a on a non backed up disk to begin with.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so that so that otherwise you don't you|D|Bmr024
me011|right.|S|Bmr024
fe008|well but you can have it n w archive to you can have uh a non backed up disk n w archived.|S|Bmr024
me011|right.|S|Bmr024
fe008|and it'll never show up on the nightly back ups.|S|Bmr024
me011|and then it never|D|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
me011|right.|S|Bmr024
me011|which i'm sure would make the sysadmins very happy.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|so i think that's a good idea.|S|Bmr024
mn017|okay.|B|Bmr024
me011|that's what we should do.|S|Bmr024
mn017|okay.|B|Bmr024
me011|so that means we'll probably want to convert all all those files filesystems to non backed up media.|S|Bmr024
me018|that sounds good.|S|Bmr024
me011|yep.|B|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|um another thing on the agenda said s r i recognition experiments?|Q|Bmr024
me013|what's that?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|s r i recognition?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|oh.|S|Bmr024
me011|that wasn't me.|S|Bmr024
mn017|um well|F|Bmr024
me013|uh.|D|Bmr024
me013|who's that?|D|Bmr024
mn017|we have lots of them.|S|Bmr024
mn017|uh i don't know.|S|Bmr024
mn017|chuck do you have any any updates?|Q|Bmr024
me018|i'm successfully uh increasing the error rate.|S|Bmr024
me018|uh|F|Bmr024
me011|that's good.|S|Bmr024
mn017|oh.|B|Bmr024
me001|huh.|B|Bmr024
fe016|lift the herve approach.|S|Bmr024
me018|yeah.|S|Bmr024
me018|so i mean i'm just playing with um the number of gaussians that we use in the the recognizer and|D|Bmr024
mn017|well you have to you have to tell people that you're you're doing you're trying the tandem features.|S|Bmr024
me018|yes i'm using tandem features.|S|Bmr024
me011|oh you are?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|and i'm still tinkering with the p l p features.|S|Bmr024
me011|cool.|S|Bmr024
me018|and|D|Bmr024
me013|yeah i got confused by the results.|S|Bmr024
me013|it because uh the meeting before you said okay we got it down to where they're they're within a tenth of a percent.|S|Bmr024
me018|that was on males.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
mn017|that was that was before i tried it on the females.|S|Bmr024
me013|oh.|S|Bmr024
mn017|see women are are trouble.|S|Bmr024
me013|it's the women are the problem.|S|Bmr024
me013|okay.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|as we all know.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so|F|Bmr024
fe016|well let's just say that men are simple.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so so when so i i had i|D|Bmr024
me011|that was a quick response.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so we had reached the point where|D|Bmr024
fe016|i'm well rehearsed.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|we had reached the point where um on the male portion of the development set the um or one of the development sets i should say the um the male error rate with uh icsi p l p features was pretty much identical with uh s r i features.|S|Bmr024
mn017|which are m f c c.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so um then i thought oh great.|S|Bmr024
mn017|i'll i'll just let's make sure everything works on the females.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and the error rate you know there was a three percent difference.|S|Bmr024
me013|oh.|B|Bmr024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
mn017|so|F|Bmr024
fe016|is there less training data?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|uh|F|Bmr024
fe016|i mean we|D|Bmr024
mn017|no actually there's more training data.|S|Bmr024
fe016|this is on just digits?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|no no.|S|Bmr024
fe016|oh sorry.|S|Bmr024
me013|no.|D|Bmr024
me011|no.|S|Bmr024
me011|it's uh|D|Bmr024
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr024
me018|hub five.|S|Bmr024
fe016|this is on|D|Bmr024
mn017|this is hub five.|S|Bmr024
fe016|oh okay.|S|Bmr024
me011|hub five.|S|Bmr024
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|um and the test data is callhome and switchboard.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so uh so then um|F|Bmr024
mn017|oh and plus the the vocal tract length normalization didn't actually made things worse.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so something's really seriously wrong.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so|F|Bmr024
mn017|um|F|Bmr024
me013|aha.|B|Bmr024
mn017|so so|F|Bmr024
me013|okay.|B|Bmr024
me013|so but you see now between between the males and the females there's certainly a much bigger difference in the scaling range than there is say just within the males.|S|Bmr024
me013|and what you were using before was scaling factors that were just from the the the s r i front end.|S|Bmr024
me013|and that worked that worked fine.|S|Bmr024
mn017|that's true.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr024
me013|uh but now you're looking over a larger range and it may not be so fine.|S|Bmr024
mn017|well um|F|Bmr024
mn017|so|F|Bmr024
mn017|i just|D|Bmr024
mn017|so the one thing that i then tried was to put in the low pass filter which we have in the|D|Bmr024
mn017|so most most hub five systems actually band limit the uh at about uh thirty seven hundred um hertz.|S|Bmr024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
mn017|although you know normally i mean the channel goes to four four thousand.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|so um|F|Bmr024
mn017|and that actually helped uh uh a little bit.|S|Bmr024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
mn017|um and it didn't hurt on the males either.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so um|F|Bmr024
mn017|and i'm now uh trying the|D|Bmr024
mn017|oh and suddenly also the the vocal tract length normalization only in the test on the test data.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so you can do vocal tract length normalization on the test data only or on both the training and the test.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|and you expect it to help a little bit if you do it only on the test and more if you do it on both training and test.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|and so the it now helps if you do it only on the test.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and i'm currently retraining another set of models where it's both in the training and the test.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and then we'll we'll have hopefully even better results.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so|F|Bmr024
mn017|but there's|D|Bmr024
mn017|it looks like there will still be some difference.|S|Bmr024
mn017|maybe between one and two percent um for the females.|S|Bmr024
me013|huh.|B|Bmr024
mn017|and so um you know i'm open to suggestions.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and it is true that the uh that the you know we are using the|D|Bmr024
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
mn017|but|D|Bmr024
mn017|it can't be just the v t l.|S|Bmr024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
mn017|because if you don't do v t l in both systems uh you know the the females are considerably worse in the with the p l p features.|S|Bmr024
me013|no no.|B|Bmr024
me013|i i remember that.|S|Bmr024
me011|it's much worse.|S|Bmr024
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|so there must be some something else going on.|S|Bmr024
fe016|well what's the standard?|Q|Bmr024
fe016|yeah so i thought the performance was actually a little better on females than males.|S|Bmr024
me011|that's what i thought too.|S|Bmr024
mn017|um that overall yes.|S|Bmr024
mn017|but on this particular development test set they're actually a little worse.|S|Bmr024
mn017|but that's beside the point.|S|Bmr024
mn017|we're looking at the discrepancy between the s r i system and the s r i system when trained with icsi features.|S|Bmr024
fe016|right.|S|Bmr024
fe016|i'm just wondering if that if if you have any indication of your standard features.|S|Bmr024
me011|what's are the|D|Bmr024
fe016|you know if that's also different or in the same direction or not.|S|Bmr024
me013|you're this is let me ask a more basic|D|Bmr024
fe016|because|D|Bmr024
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
me013|i mean is this uh uh iterative baum welch training?|Q|Bmr024
me013|or is it viterbi training?|Q|Bmr024
me013|or|D|Bmr024
mn017|it's baum welch training.|S|Bmr024
me013|baum welch training.|S|Bmr024
me013|and how do you determine when to to stop iterating?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|um|F|Bmr024
mn017|well actually we we just basically do a a fixed number of iterations.|S|Bmr024
me011|huh.|B|Bmr024
mn017|uh in this case four.|S|Bmr024
mn017|um which uh we used to do only three.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and then we found out we can squeeze|D|Bmr024
mn017|and it was basically we're we're keeping it on the safe side.|S|Bmr024
mn017|but you're|D|Bmr024
mn017|right.|F|Bmr024
mn017|it might be that one more iteration would would help but it's sort of|D|Bmr024
mn017|you know.|F|Bmr024
me013|or maybe or maybe you're doing one too many.|S|Bmr024
me013|i mean it's it's|D|Bmr024
mn017|no but with baum welch there shouldn't be an over fitting issue really.|S|Bmr024
me013|uh well there can be.|S|Bmr024
me013|sure.|B|Bmr024
mn017|um|F|Bmr024
me011|well you can try each one on a cross validation set.|S|Bmr024
me013|it if you if you remember some years ago bill byrne did a thing where he was he was looking at that.|S|Bmr024
me011|can't you?|Q|Bmr024
me013|and he showed that you could get it.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|so|F|Bmr024
me013|but but but um|F|Bmr024
mn017|well yeah.|F|Bmr024
mn017|we can|D|Bmr024
mn017|well that's that's the easy one to check.|S|Bmr024
mn017|because we save all the intermediate models.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|do you|D|Bmr024
mn017|and we can|D|Bmr024
me013|and in each case|D|Bmr024
me011|what|D|Bmr024
me013|um i'm sorry.|S|Bmr024
me013|in each case how do you determine you know the the usual fudge factors?|Q|Bmr024
me013|the uh the uh language uh scaling acoustic scaling.|S|Bmr024
me013|uh uh|F|Bmr024
mn017|um i i'm actually re optimizing them.|S|Bmr024
mn017|although that hasn't shown to make a big difference.|S|Bmr024
me013|okay.|S|Bmr024
me013|and the the question he was asking at one point about pruning.|S|Bmr024
me013|uh|F|Bmr024
mn017|pruning|D|Bmr024
me013|remember that one?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|pruning in the|D|Bmr024
me013|well he was he's it looked like the at one point he was looking at the probabilities he was getting out at the likelihoods he was getting out of p l p versus mel cepstrum and they looked pretty different.|S|Bmr024
me018|yeah the likelihoods were lower for the p l p.|S|Bmr024
me013|as i recall.|S|Bmr024
fe016|oh.|B|Bmr024
me013|and so uh there's the question.|S|Bmr024
mn017|you mean did you see this in the s r i system?|Q|Bmr024
me018|uhhuh.|S|Bmr024
mn017|um well the likelihoods are|D|Bmr024
me018|was just looking through the log files.|S|Bmr024
me018|and|D|Bmr024
mn017|you can't directly compare them because for every set of models you compute a new normalization.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and so these log probabilities they aren't directly comparable.|S|Bmr024
me018|oh.|S|Bmr024
mn017|because you have a different normalization constants for each model you train.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so|F|Bmr024
me018|huh.|B|Bmr024
me013|but still it's a question.|S|Bmr024
me013|if you have some threshold somewhere in terms of beam search or something?|Q|Bmr024
me018|well yeah.|F|Bmr024
me013|or|D|Bmr024
me018|that's what i was wondering.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr024
mn017|i mean|D|Bmr024
mn017|uh|F|Bmr024
me018|i mean if you have one threshold that works well because the range of your likelihoods is in this area|D|Bmr024
mn017|we prune very conservatively.|S|Bmr024
mn017|i mean as we saw with the meeting data um we could probably tighten the pruning without really|D|Bmr024
mn017|so we basically we have a very open beam.|S|Bmr024
me013|but you're only talking about a percent or two.|S|Bmr024
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|right?|Q|Bmr024
me013|here we're we're saying that there gee there's this uh there's this difference here.|S|Bmr024
me013|and it|D|Bmr024
me013|see because there could be lots of things.|S|Bmr024
me013|right?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|right.|S|Bmr024
me013|but but but but um let's suppose just for a second that uh we've sort of taken out a lot of the the major differences uh between the two.|S|Bmr024
mn017|course.|B|Bmr024
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
me013|i mean we're already sort of using the mel scale and we're using the same style filter integration.|S|Bmr024
me013|and and well we're making sure that low and high|D|Bmr024
mn017|actually there is the difference in that.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so for the p l p features we use the triangular filter shapes.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and for the in the s r i front end we use the trapezoidal one.|S|Bmr024
me011|and what's the top frequency of each?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|well now it's the same.|S|Bmr024
mn017|it's thirty thirty to seven hundred and sixty hertz.|S|Bmr024
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|one's triangular one's trapezoidal.|S|Bmr024
me011|so|F|Bmr024
mn017|no no.|S|Bmr024
mn017|but|D|Bmr024
me013|before we with straight p l p it's trapezoidal also.|S|Bmr024
mn017|well|F|Bmr024
mn017|but|F|Bmr024
me013|but then we had a slight difference in the in the scale.|S|Bmr024
me013|uh so|F|Bmr024
mn017|since currently the feacalc program doesn't allow me to change the filter shape independently of the scale.|S|Bmr024
me011|uhhuh.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and i did the experiment on the s r i front end where i tried the where the standard used to be to use trapezoidal filters.|S|Bmr024
mn017|you can actually continuously vary it between the two.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and so i i i tried the uh triangular ones.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and it did slightly worse but it's really a small difference.|S|Bmr024
me011|huh.|B|Bmr024
mn017|so|F|Bmr024
me013|couple tenths of a percent or something.|S|Bmr024
me011|okay.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah exactly.|S|Bmr024
me011|so it's not just losing some frequency range.|S|Bmr024
me013|right.|B|Bmr024
mn017|so it's not|D|Bmr024
mn017|i don't think the filter shape by itself will make a huge difference.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|right.|S|Bmr024
me013|so the the other thing that|D|Bmr024
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|so|F|Bmr024
me013|we've always viewed it anyway as the major difference between the two is actually in the smoothing.|S|Bmr024
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
me013|that the that the um p l p and and the reason p l p has been advantageous in uh slightly noisy situations is because p l p does the smoothing at the end by an auto regressive model.|S|Bmr024
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
me013|and mel cepstrum does it by just computing the lower cepstral coefficients.|S|Bmr024
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
me013|um so um uhhuh.|F|Bmr024
mn017|okay.|F|Bmr024
mn017|so one thing i haven't done yet is to actually do all of this with a much larger with our full training set.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so right now we're using a|D|Bmr024
mn017|i don't know.|S|Bmr024
mn017|forty?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|it's it's it's a training set that's about um you know by a factor of four smaller than what we use when we train the full system.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so some of these smoothing issues are over fitting for that matter.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and the baum welch should be much less of a factor if you go full whole hog.|S|Bmr024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
me013|could be.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and so so just um so the strategy is to first sort of treat things with fast turnaround on a smaller training set and then when you've sort of narrowed it down you try it on a larger training set.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|and so we haven't done that yet.|S|Bmr024
me013|now the other related question though is is uh what's the boot models for these things?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|the boot models are trained from scratch.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so we compute|D|Bmr024
mn017|um|F|Bmr024
mn017|so we start with a um alignment that we computed with the sort of the best system we have.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and and then we train from scratch.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so we we do a you know um we collect the uh the observations from those alignments under each of the feature sets that that we train.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and then from there we do|D|Bmr024
mn017|um|F|Bmr024
mn017|there's a lot of|D|Bmr024
mn017|actually the way it works you first train a phonetically tied mixture model.|S|Bmr024
mn017|um|F|Bmr024
mn017|you do a total of|D|Bmr024
mn017|first you do a context independent p t m model.|S|Bmr024
mn017|then you switch to a context|D|Bmr024
mn017|you do two iterations of that.|S|Bmr024
mn017|then you do two iterations of of of context dependent phonetically tied mixtures.|S|Bmr024
mn017|and then from that you you do the you you go to a state clustered model.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|and you do four iterations of that.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so there's a lot of iterations overall between your original boot models and the final models.|S|Bmr024
mn017|i don't think that|D|Bmr024
mn017|huh.|F|Bmr024
mn017|we have never seen big differences.|S|Bmr024
mn017|once i thought oh i can now i have these much better models.|S|Bmr024
mn017|i'll re generate my initial alignments.|S|Bmr024
mn017|then i'll get much better models at the end.|S|Bmr024
mn017|made no difference whatsoever.|S|Bmr024
mn017|it's i think it's uh|D|Bmr024
me013|right.|S|Bmr024
mn017|the boot models are|D|Bmr024
me013|well for making things better.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr024
me013|but this for making things worse.|S|Bmr024
me013|this it|D|Bmr024
me013|the thought is is is possible another possible partial cause is if the boot models used a used a different feature set that|D|Bmr024
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
mn017|but there are no boot models in fact.|S|Bmr024
mn017|you you're not booting from initial models.|S|Bmr024
mn017|you're booting from initial alignments.|S|Bmr024
me013|which you got from a different feature set.|S|Bmr024
mn017|that's correct.|S|Bmr024
me013|so those features look at the data differently actually.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah but|D|Bmr024
me013|i mean you know they they will find boundaries a little differently though.|S|Bmr024
me013|you know all all that sort of thing is actually slightly different.|S|Bmr024
me013|i'd expect it to be a minor effect.|S|Bmr024
mn017|but but but what i'm what i'm saying is|D|Bmr024
me013|but|F|Bmr024
mn017|so we for a long time we had used boot alignments that had been trained with a with the same front end but with acoustic models that were like fifteen percent worse than what we use now.|S|Bmr024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
mn017|and with a different dictionary with a considerably different dictionary which was much less detailed and much less well suited.|S|Bmr024
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|and so then we switched to new boot alignments.|S|Bmr024
mn017|which which now had the benefit of all these improvements that we've made over two years in the system.|S|Bmr024
me013|right.|B|Bmr024
mn017|and the result in the end was no different.|S|Bmr024
me013|right.|B|Bmr024
mn017|so what i'm saying is the exact nature of these boot alignments is probably not a big factor in the quality of the final models.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah maybe not.|S|Bmr024
me013|but it it i still see it as i mean there's there's a history to this too.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|but i uh i don't want to go into.|S|Bmr024
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
me013|but but i i i i think it could be the things that it the data is being viewed in a certain way uh that a beginning is here rather than there and so forth.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
me013|because the actual signal processing you're doing is slightly different.|S|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
me013|but it's it's that's probably not it.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|anyway i i i should really reserve uh any conclusions until we've done it on the large training set um and until we've seen the results with the with the v t l in training.|S|Bmr024
mn017|so|F|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr024
me013|at some point you also might want to take the same thing and try it on uh some broadcast news data or something else that actually has has some noisy noisy components so we can see if any conclusions we come to holds across different data.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|right.|B|Bmr024
me013|uh|F|Bmr024
mn017|and uh with this i have to leave.|S|Bmr024
me001|huh!|B|Bmr024
me013|okay.|S|Bmr024
me013|so is there something quick about absinthe that you|D|Bmr024
mn017|with this said.|S|Bmr024
me011|uh just what we were talking about before which is that i ported a blass library to absinthe.|S|Bmr024
me011|and then got got it working with fast forward.|S|Bmr024
me011|and got a speedup roughly proportional to the number of processors times the clock cycle.|S|Bmr024
mn017|oh.|B|Bmr024
me011|so that's pretty good.|S|Bmr024
mn017|oh!|S|Bmr024
mn017|cool.|S|Bmr024
me011|um i'm in the process of doing it for quicknet.|S|Bmr024
me011|but there's something going wrong.|S|Bmr024
me011|and it's about half the speed that i was estimating it should be.|S|Bmr024
me011|and i'm not sure why.|S|Bmr024
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
me011|but i'll keep working on it.|S|Bmr024
me011|but the what it means is that it's likely that for net training and forward passes we'll absinthe will be a good machine.|S|Bmr024
me011|especially if we get a few more processors and upgrade the processors.|S|Bmr024
mn017|a few more processors?|Q|Bmr024
mn017|how many are you shooting for?|Q|Bmr024
me011|there're five now.|S|Bmr024
me011|it can hold eight.|S|Bmr024
mn017|oh okay.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah we'll just go buy them i guess.|S|Bmr024
me011|and it's also five fifty megahertz and you can get a gigahertz.|S|Bmr024
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me011|so|F|Bmr024
mn017|can you mix uh processors of different speed?|Q|Bmr024
me011|i don't think so.|S|Bmr024
me011|i think we'd have to do all|D|Bmr024
mn017|okay.|B|Bmr024
me013|probably just throw away the old ones.|S|Bmr024
me011|yep.|S|Bmr024
me013|and|F|Bmr024
me013|thank you for the box.|S|Bmr024
me013|and i'll just go buy their process.|S|Bmr024
mn017|oh okay.|S|Bmr024
me001|huh!|B|Bmr024
mn017|maybe we can stick them in another system.|S|Bmr024
mn017|i don't know.|S|Bmr024
me011|we'd have to get a almost certainly have to get a uh netfinity server.|S|Bmr024
mn017|i see.|S|Bmr024
me011|they're pretty pretty specialized.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
mn017|okay.|B|Bmr024
me013|okay.|F|Bmr024
me013|is is liz coming back do you know?|Q|Bmr024
me013|or|D|Bmr024
me013|i don't know.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr024
me013|oh you don't.|S|Bmr024
me013|okay.|B|Bmr024
me013|all right.|B|Bmr024
me013|all right.|S|Bmr024
me013|see you.|S|Bmr024
me013|um.|B|Bmr024
me013|all right.|F|Bmr024
me013|so|F|Bmr024
me013|uh they're having tea out there.|S|Bmr024
me013|so i guess the other thing that we were going to talk about is is uh demo.|S|Bmr024
me013|and um so these are the demos for the uh july uh meeting and um darpa|D|Bmr024
me011|july what?|Q|Bmr024
me011|early july?|Q|Bmr024
me011|late july?|Q|Bmr024
me013|oh i think it's july fifteenth.|S|Bmr024
fe008|sixteen to eighteen i think.|S|Bmr024
me013|is that it?|Q|Bmr024
me013|yeah sixteenth eighteenth.|S|Bmr024
fe008|roughly.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr024
me013|so we talked about getting something together for that.|S|Bmr024
me013|but maybe uh maybe we'll just put that off for now given that|D|Bmr024
me013|but i think maybe we should have a a sub meeting.|S|Bmr024
me013|i think uh probably uh adam and and uh chuck and me should talk about should get together and talk about that sometime soon.|S|Bmr024
me011|over a cappuccino tomorrow?|Q|Bmr024
me013|yeah something like that.|S|Bmr024
me013|um uh you know maybe maybe we'll involve dan ellis at some some level as well.|S|Bmr024
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr024
me013|um.|F|Bmr024
me013|okay the the tea is is going so uh i suggest we do uh uh a unison.|S|Bmr024
me011|a unison digits?|Q|Bmr024
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr024
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr024
me011|which is going to be a little hard for a couple people because we have different digits forms.|S|Bmr024
me013|gets our|D|Bmr024
mn014|oops!|S|Bmr024
me011|we have a i found a couple of old ones.|S|Bmr024
me001|huh.|B|Bmr024
me013|oh.|S|Bmr024
me013|well that'll be interesting.|S|Bmr024
me013|so|F|Bmr024
me013|uh|F|Bmr024
me011|have you done digits before?|Q|Bmr024
me013|no.|S|Bmr024
me051|i haven't done it.|S|Bmr024
me011|okay.|F|Bmr024
me011|so uh the idea is just to read each line with a short pause between lines.|S|Bmr024
me051|all right.|S|Bmr024
me011|not between.|S|Bmr024
me011|and uh since we're in a hurry we were just going to read everyone all at once.|S|Bmr024
me011|so if you sort of plug your ears and read|D|Bmr024
me051|okay.|S|Bmr024
me011|so first read the transcript number and then start reading the digits.|S|Bmr024
me051|sure.|S|Bmr024
me011|okay?|Q|Bmr024
me011|one two three.|S|Bmr024
