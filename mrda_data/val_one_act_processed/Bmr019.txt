me011|okay we're on.|S|Bmr019
me013|okay.|S|Bmr019
me011|so i mean everyone who's on the wireless check that they're on?|Q|Bmr019
mn017|we|D|Bmr019
me001|all right.|S|Bmr019
fe008|i see.|S|Bmr019
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr019
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me011|okay our agenda was quite short.|S|Bmr019
me013|oh could you close the door maybe?|Q|Bmr019
me011|sure.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me011|two items which was uh digits and possibly stuff on on uh forced alignment.|S|Bmr019
me011|which jane said that liz and andreas had information on.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me011|but they didn't.|S|Bmr019
me011|so|F|Bmr019
me013|i guess the only other thing uh for which i|D|Bmr019
mn017|we should do that second.|S|Bmr019
mn017|because liz might join us in time for that.|S|Bmr019
me011|okay.|S|Bmr019
me013|um|F|Bmr019
me013|okay so there's digits alignments.|S|Bmr019
me013|and um|F|Bmr019
me013|i guess the other thing which i came unprepared for uh is uh to see if there's anything anybody wants to discuss about the saturday meeting.|S|Bmr019
me011|right.|S|Bmr019
me013|so|F|Bmr019
me013|any i mean maybe not.|S|Bmr019
me011|digits and alignments.|S|Bmr019
me011|but|F|Bmr019
me013|uh|F|Bmr019
mn017|talk about aligning people's schedules.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me011|yeah.|D|Bmr019
fe008|uhhuh.|D|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me013|i mean|D|Bmr019
me013|right.|B|Bmr019
me013|yeah i mean it was|D|Bmr019
me011|yeah it's forced alignment of people's schedules.|S|Bmr019
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|if we're very|D|Bmr019
mn014|forced align.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me013|with with whatever it was a month and a half or something ahead of time the only time we could find in common roughly in common was on a saturday.|S|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me011|yep.|B|Bmr019
me013|ugh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|it's pretty sad.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr019
fe008|have have we thought about having a conference call to include him in more of in more of the meeting?|Q|Bmr019
fe008|i i mean i don't know.|S|Bmr019
fe008|if we had the if we had the telephone on the table|D|Bmr019
me013|no.|S|Bmr019
me013|but i mean he probably has to go do something.|S|Bmr019
mn017|no actually i i have to i have to shuttle kids from various places to various other places.|S|Bmr019
me013|right?|Q|Bmr019
fe008|i see okay.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so|F|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|D|Bmr019
mn017|and i don't have and i don't um have a cell phone.|S|Bmr019
mn014|a cell phone?|Q|Bmr019
mn017|so i can't be having a conference call while driving.|S|Bmr019
fe008|no it's not good.|S|Bmr019
me013|right.|F|Bmr019
fe008|that's not good.|S|Bmr019
me013|so we have to we|D|Bmr019
mn017|plus it would make for interesting noise background noise.|S|Bmr019
me011|yep.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uh|F|Bmr019
me013|so we have to equip him with a with a with a head mounted uh cell phone.|S|Bmr019
me011|and we'd have to force you to read lots and lots of digits.|S|Bmr019
me013|and|F|Bmr019
mn017|oh yeah.|S|Bmr019
me011|so it could get real real car noise.|S|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|oh yeah.|S|Bmr019
me001|take advantage.|S|Bmr019
mn014|and with the kids in the background.|S|Bmr019
mn017|i'll let i'd let|D|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|i let uh my five year old have a try at the digits.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uh|F|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me011|so anyway i can talk about digits.|S|Bmr019
me011|um did everyone get the results or shall i go over them again?|Q|Bmr019
me011|i mean that it was basically the only thing that was even slightly surprising was that the lapel did so well.|S|Bmr019
me011|um and in retrospect that's not as surprising as maybe|D|Bmr019
me011|it shouldn't have been as surprising as i as as i felt it was.|S|Bmr019
me011|the lapel mike is a very high quality microphone.|S|Bmr019
me011|and as morgan pointed out that there are actually some advantages to it in terms of breath noises and clothes rustling if no one else is talking.|S|Bmr019
mn017|exactly.|S|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me011|um so uh|F|Bmr019
me001|it's it|D|Bmr019
me013|well it's yeah sort of the the breath noises and the mouth clicks and so forth like that the lapel's going to be better on.|S|Bmr019
mn014|or the cross talk.|S|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me013|the lapel is typically worse on the on clothes rustling.|S|Bmr019
me013|but if no one's rustling their clothes|D|Bmr019
me011|right i mean a lot of people are just sort of leaning over and reading the digits.|S|Bmr019
me013|it's it's|D|Bmr019
me011|so it's it's a very different task than sort of the natural.|S|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn014|you don't move much during reading digits i think.|S|Bmr019
me011|so|F|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|D|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me011|right.|S|Bmr019
me001|probably the fact that it picks up other people's speakers other people's talking is an indication of that it the fact it is a good microphone.|S|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me011|right.|S|Bmr019
me013|right so in the digits in most most cases there weren't other people talking.|S|Bmr019
me001|so|F|Bmr019
me011|right.|B|Bmr019
mn017|do the lapel mikes have any directionality to them?|Q|Bmr019
me013|so|F|Bmr019
me013|there typically don't no.|S|Bmr019
mn017|because i i suppose you could make some that have sort of that you have to orient towards your mouth.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and then it would|D|Bmr019
me011|they have a little bit.|S|Bmr019
me011|but they're not noise cancelling.|S|Bmr019
me011|so uh|F|Bmr019
me013|they're they're intended to be omni-directional.|S|Bmr019
me011|right.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|and it's and because you don't know how people are going to put them on you know.|S|Bmr019
me011|right.|B|Bmr019
me011|so also andreas on that one the the back part of it should be right against your head.|S|Bmr019
me011|and that will keep it from flopping up and down as much.|S|Bmr019
mn017|it is against my head.|S|Bmr019
me011|okay.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me013|um yeah we actually talked about this in the uh front end meeting this morning too.|S|Bmr019
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|much the same thing.|S|Bmr019
me013|and and it was|D|Bmr019
me013|uh i mean there the point of interest to the group was primarily that um the uh the system that we had that was based on h.t.k. that's used by you know all the participants in aurora was so much worse than the than the s.r.i.|S|Bmr019
me011|everybody.|S|Bmr019
me013|and the interesting thing is that even though yes it's a digits task and that's a relatively small number of words and there's a bunch of digits that you train on it's just not as good as having a a very large amount of data and training up a a a nice good big h.m.m.|S|Bmr019
me013|um also you had the adaptation in the s.r.i. system which we didn't have in this.|S|Bmr019
me013|um so um|F|Bmr019
mn017|and we know|D|Bmr019
mn017|did i send you some results without adaptation?|Q|Bmr019
me011|no.|S|Bmr019
me011|or if you did i didn't include them.|S|Bmr019
me013|i think stephane uh had seen them.|S|Bmr019
me011|because it was|D|Bmr019
me013|so|F|Bmr019
mn017|yeah i think i did actually.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so there was a significant loss from not doing the adaptation.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|um|F|Bmr019
mn017|a a a couple percent or|D|Bmr019
mn017|i mean|D|Bmr019
mn017|well i don't know it overall|D|Bmr019
mn017|uh i i don't remember.|S|Bmr019
mn017|but there was there was a significant um loss or win from adaptation with with adaptation.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and um|F|Bmr019
mn017|that was the phone loop adaptation.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and then there was a very small like point one percent on the natives uh win from doing um you know adaptation to the recognition hypotheses.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and i tried both means adaptation and means and variances.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and the variances added another or subtracted another point one percent.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so it's um that's the number there.|S|Bmr019
mn017|point six i believe is what you get with both uh means and variance adaptation.|S|Bmr019
me011|right.|B|Bmr019
me013|but i think one thing is that uh i would presume|D|Bmr019
me013|have you ever have you ever tried this exact same recognizer out on the actual t.i. digits test set?|Q|Bmr019
mn017|this exact same recognizer?|Q|Bmr019
mn017|no.|S|Bmr019
me013|it might be interesting to do that.|S|Bmr019
me013|because my my because my sense|D|Bmr019
me013|um|F|Bmr019
mn017|but but i have i mean people people at s.r.i. are actually working on digits.|S|Bmr019
me011|i bet it would do even slightly better.|S|Bmr019
mn017|i could and they are using a system that's um you know is actually trained on digits.|S|Bmr019
mn017|um but otherwise uses the same you know decoder the same uh training methods and so forth.|S|Bmr019
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|and i could ask them what they get on t.i. digits.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah although i'd be i think it'd be interesting to just take this exact actual system.|S|Bmr019
me013|so that these numbers were comparable.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|well adam knows how to run it.|S|Bmr019
me013|and try it out on t.i. digits.|S|Bmr019
me011|yeah no problem.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so you just make a|D|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me013|because our sense from the other from the aurora uh task is that|D|Bmr019
me011|and try it with t.i. digits.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|i mean because we were getting sub one percent numbers on t.i. digits also with the tandem thing.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr019
me013|so one so there were a number of things we noted from this.|S|Bmr019
me013|one is yeah the s.r.i. system is a lot better than the h.t.k.|S|Bmr019
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr019
me013|this you know very limited training h.t.k. system.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|D|Bmr019
me013|uh but the other is that um the digits recorded here in this room with these close mikes uh are actually a lot harder than the studio recording t.i. digits.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|i think you know one reason for that uh might be that there's still even though it's close talking there still is some noise and some room acoustics.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|and another might be that uh i'd i would presume that in the studio uh uh situation recording read speech that if somebody.|S|Bmr019
me013|did something a little funny or pronounced something a little funny or made a little that they didn't include it.|S|Bmr019
me011|they didn't include it?|Q|Bmr019
me013|they made them do it again.|S|Bmr019
me011|whereas i took out the ones that i noticed that were blatant that were correctable.|S|Bmr019
me013|huh.|D|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me011|so that if someone just read the wrong digit i corrected it.|S|Bmr019
me011|and then there was another one where jose couldn't tell whether i couldn't tell whether he was saying zero or six.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me011|and i asked him and he couldn't tell either.|S|Bmr019
me026|huh.|B|Bmr019
me011|so i just cut it out.|S|Bmr019
me011|you know so i just edited out the first uh word of the utterance.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me011|um so there's a little bit of correction but it's definitely not as clean as t.i. digits.|S|Bmr019
me011|so my expectations is t.i. digits would especially|D|Bmr019
me011|i think t.i. digits is all american english.|S|Bmr019
me011|right?|Q|Bmr019
me011|so it would probably do even a little better still.|S|Bmr019
me013|uhhuh.|S|Bmr019
me011|on the s.r.i. system.|S|Bmr019
me011|but we could give it a try.|S|Bmr019
mn017|well|F|Bmr019
mn017|but remember we're using a telephone bandwidth front end here uh on this uh on this s.r.i. system.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so um i was i thought that maybe that's actually a good thing.|S|Bmr019
mn017|because it it gets rid of some of the uh the noises.|S|Bmr019
mn017|um you know in the the below and above the um the you know speech bandwidth.|S|Bmr019
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|and um|F|Bmr019
mn017|i suspect that to get sort of the last bit out of these higher quality recordings you would have to in fact uh use models that uh were trained on wider band data.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and of course we can't do that or|D|Bmr019
me011|what's t.i. digits?|Q|Bmr019
me011|i thought|D|Bmr019
me013|it's wide band yeah.|S|Bmr019
me013|it's in in fact we looked it up.|S|Bmr019
me011|it is wide band.|S|Bmr019
me011|okay.|S|Bmr019
me013|and it was actually twenty kilohertz sampling.|S|Bmr019
me011|oh that's right.|S|Bmr019
me011|i i did look that up.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|D|Bmr019
me011|i couldn't remember whether that was t.i. digits or one of the other digit tasks.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|right.|B|Bmr019
mn017|but but i would|D|Bmr019
mn017|yeah.|F|Bmr019
mn017|it's it's easy enough to try.|S|Bmr019
mn017|just run it on|D|Bmr019
me011|uhhuh.|D|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me011|so morgan you're getting a little breath noise.|S|Bmr019
me013|see|D|Bmr019
mn017|now uh does|D|Bmr019
mn017|one one issue|D|Bmr019
me011|you might want to move the mike down a little bit.|S|Bmr019
mn017|one issue with with that is that um the system has this uh notion of a speaker to which is used in adaptation variance uh you know both in uh mean and variance normalization.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and also in the v.t.l. estimation.|S|Bmr019
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|so|F|Bmr019
me011|yeah i noticed the script that extracted it.|S|Bmr019
mn017|do|D|Bmr019
mn017|is|D|Bmr019
mn017|so does so so does does um the t.i. digits database have speakers that are known?|Q|Bmr019
me011|yep.|S|Bmr019
me011|yep.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and is there is there enough data or a comparable comparable amount of data to to what we have in our recordings here?|Q|Bmr019
me011|that i don't know.|S|Bmr019
me011|i don't know.|S|Bmr019
me011|i don't know how many speakers there are.|S|Bmr019
me011|and and how many speakers per utterance.|S|Bmr019
mn017|okay.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr019
me013|well the other thing would be to do it without the adaptation and compare to these numbers without the adaptation.|S|Bmr019
me013|that would|D|Bmr019
mn017|right uh but i'm not so much worried about the adaptation actually than than the um um the uh v.t.l. estimation.|S|Bmr019
me011|right.|B|Bmr019
mn017|if you have only one utterance per speaker you might actually screw up on estimating the the warping uh factor.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so um|F|Bmr019
me011|i strongly suspect that they have more speakers than we do.|S|Bmr019
mn017|right but it's not the amount of speakers.|S|Bmr019
me011|so uh|F|Bmr019
mn017|it's the it's the amount of data per speaker.|S|Bmr019
me011|right so we we could probably do an extraction that was roughly equivalent.|S|Bmr019
mn017|right.|B|Bmr019
mn017|right.|B|Bmr019
me011|um|F|Bmr019
mn017|so|F|Bmr019
me011|so although i i sort of know how to run it there are a little a few details here and there that i'll have to dig out.|S|Bmr019
mn017|okay.|F|Bmr019
mn017|the key|D|Bmr019
mn017|so the system actually extracts the speaker i.d. from the waveform names.|S|Bmr019
me011|right i saw that.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and there's a there's a script and that is actually all in one script.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so there's this one script that parses waveform names.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and extracts things like the um speaker uh i.d.|S|Bmr019
mn017|or something that can stand in as a speaker i.d.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so we might have to modify that script to recognize the um speakers um in the in the uh um t.i. digits database.|S|Bmr019
me011|right.|B|Bmr019
me011|right.|B|Bmr019
me011|and that uh|D|Bmr019
mn017|or you can fake you can fake names for these waveforms that resemble the names that we use here for the for the meetings.|S|Bmr019
me011|right.|B|Bmr019
mn017|that would be the sort of probably the safest way to do|D|Bmr019
me011|i might have to do that anyway to to do|D|Bmr019
me011|because we may have to do an extract to get the amount of data per speaker about right.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me011|the other thing is isn't t.i. digits isolated digits?|Q|Bmr019
mn017|right.|B|Bmr019
me011|or is that another one?|Q|Bmr019
me011|i'm i looked through a bunch of the digits corpora.|S|Bmr019
me011|and now they're all blurring.|S|Bmr019
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me011|because one of them was literally people reading a single digit.|S|Bmr019
me011|and then others were connected digits.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah most of t.i. digits is connected digits i think.|S|Bmr019
me011|okay.|S|Bmr019
me013|the i mean we had a bellcore corpus that we were using.|S|Bmr019
me011|maybe it's the bell gram.|S|Bmr019
me013|it was that's that was isolated digits.|S|Bmr019
me011|bell digits.|S|Bmr019
me011|all right.|S|Bmr019
mn017|by the way i think we can improve these numbers if we care to improve them by um not starting with the switchboard models but by taking the switchboard models and doing supervised adaptation on a small amount of digit data collected in this setting.|S|Bmr019
me013|um|D|Bmr019
me011|yep.|S|Bmr019
mn017|because that would adapt your models to the room acoustics.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and for the far field microphones you know to the noise.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and that should really improve things um further.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and then you use those adapted models which are not speaker adapted but sort of you know channel adapted.|S|Bmr019
me011|channel adapted.|S|Bmr019
mn017|use that as the starting models for your speaker adaptation.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah but the thing is uh i mean when you it depends whether you're were just using this as a a starter task for you know to get things going for conversational or if we're really interested in connected digits.|S|Bmr019
me013|and i i think the answer is both.|S|Bmr019
mn017|well i don't know.|S|Bmr019
me013|and for for connected digits over the telephone you don't actually want to put a whole lot of effort into adaptation.|S|Bmr019
me013|because somebody gets on the phone and says a number.|S|Bmr019
me013|and then you just want it.|S|Bmr019
me013|you don't don't uh|D|Bmr019
fe008|this is this that one's better.|S|Bmr019
mn017|right.|B|Bmr019
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|um but you know i uh my impression was that you were actually interested in the far field microphone uh problem.|S|Bmr019
mn017|i mean|D|Bmr019
mn017|so|F|Bmr019
mn017|you want to you want to that's the obvious thing to try.|S|Bmr019
fe008|oh.|B|Bmr019
fe008|oh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|right?|Q|Bmr019
mn017|then uh because you you don't have any|D|Bmr019
me013|right.|D|Bmr019
fe008|yeah.|D|Bmr019
mn017|that's where the most acoustic mismatch is between the currently used models and the the the set up here.|S|Bmr019
me013|right.|B|Bmr019
mn017|so|F|Bmr019
me013|yeah so that'd be another interesting data point.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|i mean i i guess i'm saying i don't know if we'd want to do that as the as|D|Bmr019
me011|other way.|S|Bmr019
mn014|other way.|S|Bmr019
me011|liz|D|Bmr019
fe016|now you're all watching me.|S|Bmr019
me011|it it clips over your ears.|S|Bmr019
fe016|all right.|S|Bmr019
fe016|this way.|S|Bmr019
me011|there you go.|S|Bmr019
fe008|if you have a strong if you have a strong preference you could use this.|S|Bmr019
fe016|you're all watching.|D|Bmr019
fe016|this is terrible.|S|Bmr019
fe008|it's just we we think it has some spikes.|S|Bmr019
fe008|so uh we we didn't use that one.|S|Bmr019
fe016|i'll get it.|S|Bmr019
fe008|but you could if you want.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah at any rate i don't know if|D|Bmr019
fe008|i don't know.|D|Bmr019
fe008|and andreas your your microphone's a little bit low.|S|Bmr019
mn017|it is?|D|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me013|i don't know if we want to use that as the|D|Bmr019
mn017|uh|D|Bmr019
me011|uh it pivots.|S|Bmr019
fe008|so if you see the picture|D|Bmr019
mn017|i|D|Bmr019
me011|it it like this.|S|Bmr019
fe008|and then you have to|D|Bmr019
mn017|i i already adjusted this a number of times.|S|Bmr019
me011|uh|D|Bmr019
mn017|i i|D|Bmr019
me011|yeah i think these mikes are not working as well as i would like.|S|Bmr019
mn017|can't quite seem to|D|Bmr019
mn017|yeah i think this contraption around your head is not working so well.|S|Bmr019
me013|too many too many adjustments yeah.|S|Bmr019
me013|anyway what i was saying is that i i think i probably wouldn't want to see that as sort of like the norm that we compared all things to.|S|Bmr019
fe008|that looks good.|D|Bmr019
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me013|to uh the to have have all this all this uh adaptation.|S|Bmr019
me013|but i think it's an important data point if you're if|D|Bmr019
mn017|right.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me013|um|F|Bmr019
me013|the other thing that that uh of course what barry was looking at was was just that.|S|Bmr019
me013|the near versus far.|S|Bmr019
me013|and yeah the adaptation would get some of that.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|but i think even even if there was uh only a factor of two or something like i was saying in the email i think that's that's a big factor.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|so|F|Bmr019
me011|liz you could also just use the other mike if you're having problems with that one.|S|Bmr019
fe008|well.|F|Bmr019
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr019
fe008|yeah this would be okay.|S|Bmr019
fe008|we we we think that this has spikes on it.|S|Bmr019
fe016|it's this thing's this is too big for my head.|S|Bmr019
fe008|so it's not as good acoustically.|S|Bmr019
mn017|yeah basically your ears are too big.|S|Bmr019
fe008|but|F|Bmr019
mn017|i mean mine are too.|S|Bmr019
mn017|everybody's ears are too big for these things.|S|Bmr019
fe016|no my my but this is too big for my head.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uh|F|Bmr019
fe016|so i mean it doesn't you know it's|D|Bmr019
fe008|well if you'd rather have this one then it's|D|Bmr019
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|D|Bmr019
me011|oh well.|S|Bmr019
me013|it's great.|S|Bmr019
me011|so the to get that uh pivoted this way it pivots like this.|S|Bmr019
fe016|no this way.|S|Bmr019
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me011|there you go.|S|Bmr019
fe008|and there's a screw that you can tighten.|S|Bmr019
me011|and then it|D|Bmr019
me011|right.|S|Bmr019
fe016|right.|S|Bmr019
fe016|i already tried to get it close.|S|Bmr019
fe008|good.|S|Bmr019
me011|so if it doesn't bounce around too much that's actually good placement.|S|Bmr019
fe008|that looks good.|S|Bmr019
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr019
me011|but it looks like it's going to bounce a lot.|S|Bmr019
me013|so where were we?|Q|Bmr019
me013|uh yeah.|F|Bmr019
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me011|digits.|S|Bmr019
me011|adaptation.|S|Bmr019
me013|uh adaptation non adaptation.|S|Bmr019
me013|um factor of two.|S|Bmr019
me013|um|F|Bmr019
mn017|what by the way what factor of two did you|D|Bmr019
me013|oh yeah i know what i was.|S|Bmr019
mn017|i mean|D|Bmr019
me013|oh no no.|S|Bmr019
me013|it's that that we were saying you know well is how much worse is far than near you know.|S|Bmr019
mn017|oh okay.|S|Bmr019
me013|and i mean it depends on which one you're looking at.|S|Bmr019
mn017|that factor of two.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|but for the everybody it's little under a factor or two.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah i i know what i was thinking was that maybe uh we could actually try at least looking at uh some of the the large vocabulary speech from a far microphone.|S|Bmr019
me013|at least from the good one.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|i mean before i thought we'd get you know a hundred and fifty percent error or something.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|but if if uh if we're getting thirty five forty percent or something um|D|Bmr019
fe016|actually if you run though on a close talking mike over the whole meeting during all those silences you get like four hundred percent word error.|S|Bmr019
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|right i understand.|S|Bmr019
me013|but doing the same kind of limited thing|D|Bmr019
fe016|or or some high number.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah sure.|S|Bmr019
me013|get all these insertions.|S|Bmr019
me013|but i'm saying if you do the same kind of limited thing as people have done in switchboard evaluations or as|D|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe016|where you know who the speaker is and there's no overlap?|Q|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and you do just the far field for those regions?|Q|Bmr019
me013|yeah the same sort of numbers that we got those graphs from.|S|Bmr019
me011|could we do exactly the same thing that we're doing now but do it with a far field mike.|S|Bmr019
me013|right?|Q|Bmr019
me013|yeah do it with one of|D|Bmr019
me011|because we extract the times from the near field mike.|S|Bmr019
me011|but you use the acoustics from the far field mike.|S|Bmr019
fe016|right i understand that.|S|Bmr019
fe016|i just meant that so you have three choices.|S|Bmr019
fe016|there's um you can use times where that person is talking only from the transcripts but the segmentations were were synchronized.|S|Bmr019
fe016|or you can do a forced alignment on the close talking to determine that you know within this segment these really were the times that this person was talking.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and elsewhere in the segment other people are overlapping.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and just front end those pieces.|S|Bmr019
fe016|or you can run it on the whole data.|S|Bmr019
fe016|which is which is you know a|D|Bmr019
me013|but but but how did we get the how did we determine the links uh that we're testing on in the stuff we reported?|Q|Bmr019
fe016|in the h.l.t. paper we took segments that are channel time aligned.|S|Bmr019
fe016|which is now being changed in the transcription process.|S|Bmr019
fe016|which is good.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and we took cases where the transcribers said there was only one person talking here.|S|Bmr019
fe016|because no one else had time any words in that segment.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and called that non overlap.|S|Bmr019
me013|and|D|Bmr019
me013|and that's what we were getting those numbers from.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yes.|S|Bmr019
me013|right.|S|Bmr019
fe016|good the good numbers.|S|Bmr019
fe016|the bad numbers were from the segments where there was overlap.|S|Bmr019
me013|well we could start with the good ones.|S|Bmr019
me013|but anyway so i think that we should try it once with the same conditions that were used to create those.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me013|and in those same segments just use one of the p.z.m.'s.|S|Bmr019
fe016|right so we we can do that.|S|Bmr019
me013|and then you know i mean the thing is if we were getting uh what thirty five forty percent something like that on on that particular set|D|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me013|uh does it go to seventy or eighty?|Q|Bmr019
me013|or does it use up so much memory we can't decode it?|Q|Bmr019
fe016|right.|B|Bmr019
fe016|it might also depend on which speaker it is and how close they are to the p.z.m.|S|Bmr019
me013|uh|F|Bmr019
fe016|i don't know how different they are from each other.|S|Bmr019
mn017|you want to probably choose the p.z.m. channel that is closest to the speaker.|S|Bmr019
fe016|to be best|D|Bmr019
me011|for this particular digit ones i just picked that one.|S|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me013|well|D|Bmr019
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr019
mn017|oh okay.|S|Bmr019
fe016|so we would then use that one too.|S|Bmr019
me011|so|D|Bmr019
me013|this is kind of central.|S|Bmr019
fe016|or|D|Bmr019
me013|you know it's so but i would i'd pick that one.|S|Bmr019
me013|it'll be less good for some people than for other.|S|Bmr019
me013|but i i'd like to see it on the same exact same data set that that we did the other thing on.|S|Bmr019
me011|actually|D|Bmr019
me011|i actually should've picked a different one.|S|Bmr019
me013|right?|Q|Bmr019
me011|because that could be why the p.d.a. is worse.|S|Bmr019
me011|because it's further away from most of the people reading digits.|S|Bmr019
mn014|it's further away yeah.|S|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me013|that's probably one of the reasons.|S|Bmr019
fe008|huh.|B|Bmr019
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
fe016|well yeah you could look at i guess that p.z.m. or something.|S|Bmr019
me011|yep.|B|Bmr019
me013|but the other is it's very uh i mean even though there's i'm sure the the the s.r.i. uh front end has some kind of pre emphasis it's it's uh still it's picking up lots of low frequency energy.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|so even discriminating against it i'm sure some of it's getting through.|S|Bmr019
me013|um|F|Bmr019
me013|but yeah you're right.|S|Bmr019
me013|a part of it is just the distance.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and aren't these pretty bad microphones?|Q|Bmr019
me011|yep.|S|Bmr019
fe016|i mean|D|Bmr019
me013|well they're bad.|S|Bmr019
me013|but i mean if you listen to it it sounds okay you know.|S|Bmr019
me011|yeah when you listen to it uh the p.z.m. and the p.d.a. yeah the p.d.a. has higher sound floor.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|D|Bmr019
me011|but not by a lot.|S|Bmr019
me011|it's really pretty uh pretty much the same.|S|Bmr019
fe016|i just remember you saying you got them to be cheap on purpose.|S|Bmr019
fe016|cheap in terms of their quality.|S|Bmr019
fe016|so|F|Bmr019
me013|well they're twenty five cents or so.|S|Bmr019
me011|we wanted them to be to be typical of what would be in a p.d.a.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|D|Bmr019
me011|so they are they're not the p.z.m. three hundred dollar type.|S|Bmr019
fe016|uhhuh.|D|Bmr019
me011|they're the twenty five cent.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me011|buy them in packs of thousand type.|S|Bmr019
me013|but i mean the thing is people use those little mikes for everything.|S|Bmr019
fe016|i see.|D|Bmr019
me011|everything.|S|Bmr019
me013|because they're really not bad.|S|Bmr019
me013|i mean if you're not doing something ridiculous like feeding it to a speech recognizer they they they you know you can hear the hear the sounds just fine.|S|Bmr019
fe016|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
fe016|right.|B|Bmr019
me013|you know it's|D|Bmr019
me013|they i mean it's more or less the same principles as these other mikes are built under.|S|Bmr019
me013|it's just that there's less quality control.|S|Bmr019
me013|they just you know churn them out and don't check them.|S|Bmr019
me013|um so|F|Bmr019
me013|so that was yeah so that was interesting result.|S|Bmr019
me013|so like i said the front end guys are very much interested in in this is as as well.|S|Bmr019
me013|and|D|Bmr019
mn017|so so but where is this now?|Q|Bmr019
mn017|i mean what's where do we go from here?|Q|Bmr019
mn017|i mean|D|Bmr019
me011|yeah that was going to be my question.|S|Bmr019
mn017|we so we have a we have a a system that works pretty well.|S|Bmr019
mn017|but it's not you know the system that people here are used to using to working with.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so what what do we do now?|Q|Bmr019
me013|well i think what we want to do is we want to uh|D|Bmr019
me013|and we've talked about this in other contexts.|S|Bmr019
me013|we want to have the ability to feed it different features.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|and then um from the point of view of the front end research it would be uh substituting for h.t.k.|S|Bmr019
mn017|okay.|B|Bmr019
mn017|okay.|S|Bmr019
me013|i think that's the key thing.|S|Bmr019
me013|and then if we can feed it different features then we can try all the different things that we're trying there.|S|Bmr019
mn017|okay all right.|B|Bmr019
me013|and then um uh also dave is is thinking about using the data in different ways uh to um uh explicitly work on reverberation.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|D|Bmr019
me013|starting with some techniques that some other people have found somewhat useful and yeah.|S|Bmr019
mn017|okay.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so so the key thing that's missing here is basically the ability to feed you know other features into the recognizer.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and also then to train the system.|S|Bmr019
me013|right.|S|Bmr019
me013|right.|S|Bmr019
mn017|okay.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and uh i don't know when chuck will be back.|S|Bmr019
mn017|but that's exactly what he he's going to|D|Bmr019
me013|he's he's sort of back.|S|Bmr019
me013|but he drove for fourteen hours and wasn't going to make it in today.|S|Bmr019
mn017|oh okay.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so i think that's one of the things that he said he would be working on.|S|Bmr019
mn017|um|F|Bmr019
mn017|just sort of to make sure that we can do that.|S|Bmr019
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|and um|F|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me013|right.|S|Bmr019
mn017|it's uh i mean the the front end is that's in the s.r.i. recognizer is very nice in that it does a lot of things on the fly.|S|Bmr019
mn017|but it unfortunately is not designed and um like the uh icsi system is where you can feed it from a pipeline of of the command.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so the what that means probably for the foreseeable future is that you have to uh dump out um|D|Bmr019
mn017|you know if you want to use some new features you have to dump them into individual files.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and give those files to the recognizer.|S|Bmr019
me011|we do we tend to do that anyway.|S|Bmr019
mn017|okay.|S|Bmr019
me011|oh.|F|Bmr019
me011|so although you you can pipe it as well we tend to do it that way.|S|Bmr019
me011|because that way you can concentrate on one block and not keep redoing it over and over.|S|Bmr019
mn017|oh okay.|S|Bmr019
mn017|all right.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah so i've i|D|Bmr019
me011|so that's exactly what the p. file is for.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr019
mn017|yeah the the the cumbersome thing is is um is that you actually have to dump out little little files.|S|Bmr019
fe016|uh|B|Bmr019
mn017|so for each segment that you want to recognize you have to dump out a separate file.|S|Bmr019
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|just like like as if there were these waveform segments.|S|Bmr019
mn017|but instead you have sort of feature file segments.|S|Bmr019
mn017|but you know|D|Bmr019
mn017|so|F|Bmr019
me013|cool.|S|Bmr019
me013|okay so the the the next thing we had on the agenda was something about alignments?|Q|Bmr019
fe016|oh.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yes we have|D|Bmr019
fe016|i don't know.|S|Bmr019
fe016|did you want to talk about it?|Q|Bmr019
fe016|or|D|Bmr019
fe016|i can give a i was just telling this to jane.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and and we we were able to get some definite improvement on the forced alignments by looking at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors that were occurring.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and um|F|Bmr019
fe016|some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible in the recognition.|S|Bmr019
fe016|which is a um i think was both a a pruning problem.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and possibly a problem with needing constraints on word locations.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and so we tried both of these things.|S|Bmr019
fe016|we tried saying|D|Bmr019
fe016|i don't know.|S|Bmr019
fe016|i got this whacky idea that just from looking at the data that when people talk their words are usually chunked together.|S|Bmr019
fe016|it's not that they say one word and then there's a bunch of words together.|S|Bmr019
fe016|they're might say one word and then another word far away if they were doing just backchannels.|S|Bmr019
fe016|but in general if there's like five or six words and one word's far away from it that's probably wrong on average.|S|Bmr019
fe016|so um|F|Bmr019
fe016|and then also the pruning of course was too too severe.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so that's actually interesting.|S|Bmr019
mn017|the pruning was the same value that we used for recognition.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and we had lowered that we had used tighter pruning after liz ran some experiments showing that you know it runs slower.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and there's no real difference in|D|Bmr019
me011|no gain.|S|Bmr019
fe016|actually it was better with slightly better or about|D|Bmr019
mn017|right.|S|Bmr019
fe016|it was the same with tighter pruning.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so for free recognition this the lower pruning value is better.|S|Bmr019
mn017|you|D|Bmr019
fe016|it's probably because the recognition's just bad at a point where it's bad enough that that you don't lose anything.|S|Bmr019
mn017|correct.|S|Bmr019
mn017|right.|B|Bmr019
mn017|um but it turned out for for to get accurate alignments it was really important to open up the pruning significantly.|S|Bmr019
fe016|right.|B|Bmr019
me013|huh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|um because otherwise it would sort of do greedy alignment um in regions where there was no real speech yet from the foreground speaker.|S|Bmr019
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|um so that was one big factor that helped improve things.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and then the other thing was that|D|Bmr019
mn017|you know as liz said the we enforce the fact that uh the foreground speech has to be continuous.|S|Bmr019
mn017|it cannot be you cannot have a background speech hypothesis in the middle of the foreground speech.|S|Bmr019
mn017|you can only have background speech at the beginning and the end.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yeah i mean yeah it isn't always true.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and i think what we really want is some clever way to do this.|S|Bmr019
fe016|where um you know from the data or from maybe some hand corrected alignments from transcribers that|D|Bmr019
fe016|things like words that do occur just by themselves alone like backchannels or something that we did allow to have background speech around it|D|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe016|those would be able to do that.|S|Bmr019
fe008|sorry.|D|Bmr019
fe016|but the rest would be constrained.|S|Bmr019
fe016|so i think we have a version that's pretty good for the native speakers.|S|Bmr019
fe016|i don't know yet about the non native speakers.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and um|F|Bmr019
fe016|we basically also made noise models for the different sort of grouped some of the mouth noises together.|S|Bmr019
fe016|um so and then there's a background speech model.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and we also|D|Bmr019
fe016|there was some neat or interesting cases.|S|Bmr019
fe016|like there's one meeting where um jose's giving a presentation.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and he's talking about um the word mixed signal.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and someone didn't understand uh that you were saying mixed.|S|Bmr019
fe016|i think morgan.|S|Bmr019
mn005|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe016|and so your speech was saying something about mixed signal.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and the next turn was a lot of people saying mixed.|S|Bmr019
fe016|like he means mixed signal or i think it's mixed.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and the word mixed in this segment occurs like a bunch of times.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and chuck's on the lapel here.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and he also says mixed.|S|Bmr019
fe016|but it's at the last one.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and of course the aligner aligns it everywhere else to everybody else's mixed.|S|Bmr019
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe016|because there's no adaptation yet.|S|Bmr019
fe016|so there's i think there's some issues about|D|Bmr019
fe016|we probably want to adapt at least the foreground speaker.|S|Bmr019
fe016|but i guess andreas tried adapting both the foreground and a background generic speaker.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and that's actually a little bit of a funky model.|S|Bmr019
fe016|like it gives you some weird alignments.|S|Bmr019
fe016|just because often the background speakers match better to the foreground than the foreground speaker.|S|Bmr019
mn017|oh|F|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn005|oh.|B|Bmr019
fe016|so there's some things there.|S|Bmr019
fe016|especially when you get lots of the same words uh occurring in the.|S|Bmr019
mn017|well the|D|Bmr019
mn017|i i think you can do better by uh cloning|D|Bmr019
mn017|so we have a reject phone.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and you and what we wanted to try with you know once we have this paper written and have a little more time uh cloning that reject model.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and then one copy of it would be adapted to the foreground speaker to capture the rejects in the foreground.|S|Bmr019
mn017|like fragments and stuff.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and the other copy would be adapted to the background speaker.|S|Bmr019
fe016|right i mean in general we actually|D|Bmr019
mn017|and|D|Bmr019
fe016|right now the words like partial words are reject models.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|D|Bmr019
fe016|and you normally allow those to match to any word.|S|Bmr019
fe016|but then the background speech was also a reject model.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and so this constraint of not allowing rejects in between.|S|Bmr019
fe016|you know it needs to differentiate between the two.|S|Bmr019
fe016|so just sort of working through a bunch of debugging kinds of issues.|S|Bmr019
mn017|right.|B|Bmr019
fe016|and another one is turns like people starting with well i think|D|Bmr019
fe016|and someone else is well how about|D|Bmr019
fe016|so the word well is in this in this segment multiple times.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and as soon as it occurs usually the aligner will try to align it to the first person who says it.|S|Bmr019
fe016|but then that constraint of sort of uh proximity constraint will push it over to the person who really said it in general.|S|Bmr019
me011|is the proximity constraint a hard constraint?|Q|Bmr019
me011|or did you do some sort of probabilistic weighting distance or|D|Bmr019
mn017|we we didn't|D|Bmr019
mn017|no.|S|Bmr019
fe016|right now it's a kluge.|S|Bmr019
mn017|we|D|Bmr019
mn017|okay.|F|Bmr019
mn017|we it's straightforward to actually just have a a penalty that doesn't completely disallows it but discourages it.|S|Bmr019
mn017|but um we just didn't have time to play with you know tuning yet another yet another parameter.|S|Bmr019
me011|the level.|S|Bmr019
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|and really the reason we can't do it is just that we don't have a we don't have ground truth for these.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so we would need a hand marked um word level alignments.|S|Bmr019
mn017|or at least sort of the boundaries of the speech you know between the speakers.|S|Bmr019
mn017|um and then use that as a reference.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and tune the parameters of the of the model uh to to get the best performance.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me013|given i i mean i i i was going to ask you anyway uh how you assessed that things were better?|Q|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|D|Bmr019
fe016|i looked at them.|S|Bmr019
fe016|i spent two days um in waves.|S|Bmr019
me013|okay.|S|Bmr019
fe016|oh it was painful.|S|Bmr019
fe016|because the thing is you know the alignments share a lot in common.|S|Bmr019
fe016|so|F|Bmr019
fe016|and you're you're looking at these segments where there's a lot of speech.|S|Bmr019
fe016|i mean a lot of them have a lot of words.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe016|not by every speaker.|S|Bmr019
fe016|but by some speaker there's a lot of words.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe016|no not|D|Bmr019
fe016|i mean that if you look at the individual segments from just one person you don't see a lot of words.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe016|but altogether you'll see a lot of words up there.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and so the reject is also mapping and pauses.|S|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe016|so i looked at them all in waves.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and just lined up all the alignments.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and at first it sort of looked like a mess.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and then the more i looked at it i thought okay well it's moving these words leftward.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and you know it wasn't that bad.|S|Bmr019
fe016|it was just doing certain things wrong.|S|Bmr019
fe016|so|F|Bmr019
fe016|but i don't you know have time to to look at all of them.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and it would be really useful to have like a a transcriber who could use waves.|S|Bmr019
fe016|um just mark like the beginning and end of the foreground speaker's real words.|S|Bmr019
fe016|like the beginning of the first word the end of the last word.|S|Bmr019
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe016|and then we could you know do some adjustments.|S|Bmr019
fe008|i okay.|S|Bmr019
fe008|i have to ask you something.|S|Bmr019
fe008|because if we could benefit from what you did incorporate that into the present transcripts that would help.|S|Bmr019
mn017|no.|S|Bmr019
fe008|and then um the other thing is i believe that i did|D|Bmr019
fe008|so one of these transcripts was gone over by a transcriber.|S|Bmr019
fe008|and then i hand marked it myself so that we do have uh the beginning and ending of individual utterances.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
fe008|um i didn't do it word level.|S|Bmr019
fe008|but but in terms|D|Bmr019
fe008|so i so for for one of the n.s.a. groups.|S|Bmr019
fe016|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
fe008|and also i went back to the original one that i first transcribed and and did it uh uh utterance by utterance for that particular one.|S|Bmr019
fe008|so i think you do have|D|Bmr019
fe008|if that's a sufficient unit i think that you do have hand marking for that.|S|Bmr019
fe008|but it'd be wonderful to be able to benefit from your waves stuff.|S|Bmr019
fe016|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|we don't care what what tool you use.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yeah i mean if if you can um if you want to|D|Bmr019
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr019
fe008|i used it in transcriber.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uh|D|Bmr019
fe008|and it's it's in the|D|Bmr019
fe016|well jane and i were just in terms of the tool talking about this.|S|Bmr019
fe016|i guess sue had had some reactions.|S|Bmr019
fe016|you know interface wise if you're looking at speech you want to be able to know really where the words are.|S|Bmr019
fe008|yeah that's right.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and so we can give you some examples of sort of what this output looks like.|S|Bmr019
fe008|middle of the word or|D|Bmr019
fe016|um and see if you can maybe incorporate it into the transcriber tool some way.|S|Bmr019
fe016|or|F|Bmr019
fe008|well i i'm thinking just incorporating it into the representation.|S|Bmr019
fe016|um|F|Bmr019
fe008|i mean if it's if it's|D|Bmr019
fe016|you mean like yeah word start insights.|S|Bmr019
fe008|if you have start points if you have like time tags|D|Bmr019
fe016|right.|B|Bmr019
fe008|which is what i assume.|S|Bmr019
fe008|isn't that what what you|D|Bmr019
fe008|well see adam would be|D|Bmr019
mn017|yeah whatever you use.|S|Bmr019
mn017|i mean we convert it to this format that the um nist scoring tool uh c.t.m. conversation time marked file.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|and and then that's the that's what the|D|Bmr019
me011|i think transcriber uh outputs c.t.m.|S|Bmr019
fe008|if it|D|Bmr019
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr019
me011|i think so.|S|Bmr019
fe008|so you would know this more than i would.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|right.|B|Bmr019
fe016|so i mean|D|Bmr019
fe008|it seems like she if she's if she's moving time marks around|D|Bmr019
fe008|since our representation in transcriber uses time marks it seems like there should be some way of of using that benefitting from that.|S|Bmr019
me011|right.|B|Bmr019
fe016|yeah it the advantage would just be that when you brought up a bin you would be able if you were zoomed in enough in transcriber to see all the words.|S|Bmr019
me013|uhhuh.|D|Bmr019
fe016|you would be able to like have the words sort of located in time.|S|Bmr019
fe016|if you wanted to do that.|S|Bmr019
me013|so so if we even just had a a it sounds like we we almost do.|S|Bmr019
fe016|so|F|Bmr019
me013|uh if we we have two.|S|Bmr019
fe008|we have two.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me013|just uh trying out the alignment procedure that you have on that.|S|Bmr019
fe016|uhhuh.|D|Bmr019
me013|you could actually get something um uh uh get an objective measure.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|D|Bmr019
me013|uh|F|Bmr019
fe016|you mean on on the hand marked um|D|Bmr019
fe016|so we we only i only looked at actually alignments from one meeting that we chose.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
fe016|i think m.r. four.|S|Bmr019
fe016|just randomly um|D|Bmr019
fe016|and|F|Bmr019
mn017|actually not randomly.|S|Bmr019
fe016|not randomly.|S|Bmr019
mn017|we knew we knew that it had these insertion errors from.|S|Bmr019
fe016|it had sort of average recognition performance in a bunch of speakers.|S|Bmr019
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe016|and it was a meeting recorder meeting.|S|Bmr019
fe016|um|F|Bmr019
fe016|but yeah we should try to use what you have.|S|Bmr019
fe016|i did rerun recognition on your new version of m.r. one.|S|Bmr019
fe008|oh good.|S|Bmr019
fe016|i i mean the the one with dan ellis in it and eric.|S|Bmr019
fe008|good.|S|Bmr019
fe008|uhhuh yeah exactly yeah yeah.|S|Bmr019
me001|i don't think that was the new version.|S|Bmr019
fe016|um|F|Bmr019
fe016|that|D|Bmr019
fe016|yeah actually it wasn't the new new.|S|Bmr019
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr019
fe016|it was the medium new.|S|Bmr019
fe016|but but we would we should do the the latest version.|S|Bmr019
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr019
me001|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me001|you did you adjust the the utterance times um for each channel?|Q|Bmr019
fe016|it was the one from last week.|S|Bmr019
fe008|yes.|S|Bmr019
fe008|yes i did.|S|Bmr019
fe008|and furthermore i found that there were a certain number where not not a lot but several times i actually moved an utterance from adam's channel to dan's or from dan's to adam's.|S|Bmr019
fe008|so there was some speaker|D|Bmr019
fe008|and the reason was because i transcribed that at a point before uh before we had the multiple audio available.|S|Bmr019
fe008|so i couldn't switch between the audio.|S|Bmr019
fe008|i i transcribed it off of the mixed channel entirely.|S|Bmr019
fe008|which meant in overlaps i was at a at a terrific disadvantage.|S|Bmr019
fe016|right.|B|Bmr019
fe016|right.|B|Bmr019
fe008|in addition it was before the channelized uh possibility was there.|S|Bmr019
fe008|and finally i did it using the speakers of my um of you know off the c.p.u. on my on my machine.|S|Bmr019
fe008|because i didn't have a headphone.|S|Bmr019
fe008|so it like i mean|D|Bmr019
fe016|right.|B|Bmr019
fe008|yeah i i mean in retrospect it would've been good to have i should've gotten a headphone.|S|Bmr019
fe008|but in any case um this is this was transcribed in a in a uh less optimal way than than the ones that came after it.|S|Bmr019
fe008|and i was able to you know and this meant that there were some speaker identifications.|S|Bmr019
me001|well i know there were some speaker labelling problems um after interruptions.|S|Bmr019
fe008|which were changes|D|Bmr019
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe008|fixed that.|S|Bmr019
me001|is that what you're referring to?|Q|Bmr019
me001|i mean because there's this one instance when for example you're running down the stairs.|S|Bmr019
fe008|oh well|D|Bmr019
me001|i remember this meeting really well.|S|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me001|right.|D|Bmr019
fe016|don don has had he knows he can just read it like a play.|S|Bmr019
me001|it's a|D|Bmr019
me001|yeah i've i've i'm very well acquainted with this meeting.|S|Bmr019
me001|yeah i can|D|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe016|and then she said and then he said.|S|Bmr019
me001|yeah i know it by heart.|S|Bmr019
me001|so um there's one point when you're running down the stairs.|S|Bmr019
fe008|uhoh!|S|Bmr019
me001|right?|Q|Bmr019
me001|and like there's an interruption.|S|Bmr019
me001|you interrupt somebody.|S|Bmr019
me001|but then there's no line after that.|S|Bmr019
me001|for example there's no speaker identification after that line.|S|Bmr019
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me001|is that what you're talking about?|Q|Bmr019
me001|or were there mislabelings as far as like the adam was?|Q|Bmr019
fe008|that was fixed um before.|S|Bmr019
fe008|i think i think i understood that pretty|D|Bmr019
me001|yeah because i thought i let you know about that.|S|Bmr019
fe008|thank you for mentioning.|S|Bmr019
me001|yeah.|S|Bmr019
fe008|yeah no that that i think went away a couple of versions ago.|S|Bmr019
me001|okay.|S|Bmr019
me001|but you're actually saying that certain uh speakers were mis identified.|S|Bmr019
fe008|but it's good to know.|S|Bmr019
fe008|yeah so with under um uh listening to the mixed channel there were times when as surprising as that is i got adam's voice confused with dan's and vice versa.|S|Bmr019
me001|okay.|S|Bmr019
fe008|not for long utterances.|S|Bmr019
me001|okay.|B|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe008|but just a couple of places.|S|Bmr019
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
fe008|and embedded in overlaps.|S|Bmr019
fe008|the other thing that was interesting to me was that i picked up a lot of um backchannels which were hidden in the mixed signal.|S|Bmr019
fe008|which you know i mean you not not too surprising.|S|Bmr019
fe016|right.|B|Bmr019
fe008|but the other thing that|D|Bmr019
fe008|i i hadn't thought about this.|S|Bmr019
fe008|but i i wanted to raise this when you were uh with respect to also a strategy which might help with the alignments potentially.|S|Bmr019
fe008|but that's|D|Bmr019
fe008|when i was looking at these backchannels they were turning up usually very often in well i won't say usually but anyway very often i picked them up in a channel which was the person who had asked a question.|S|Bmr019
fe008|so like someone says and have you done the so-and-so.|S|Bmr019
fe008|and then there would be backchannels.|S|Bmr019
fe008|but it would be the person who asked the question.|S|Bmr019
fe008|other people weren't really doing much backchanneling.|S|Bmr019
fe008|and you know sometimes you have the yeah uhhuh.|S|Bmr019
fe016|well that's interesting.|S|Bmr019
fe008|i mean it wouldn't be perfect.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe008|but but it does seem more natural to give a backchannel when when you're somehow involved in the topic.|S|Bmr019
fe016|no that's really interesting.|S|Bmr019
fe008|and the most natural way is for you to have initiated the topic by asking a question.|S|Bmr019
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|well|F|Bmr019
mn017|i think|D|Bmr019
fe016|that's interesting.|S|Bmr019
mn017|no i think it's actually i think what's going on is backchanneling is something that happens in two party conversations.|S|Bmr019
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|and if you ask someone a question you essentially initiating a little two party conversation.|S|Bmr019
fe008|yeah.|D|Bmr019
fe016|well yeah when we looked at this.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so then you're so and then you're expected to backchannel.|S|Bmr019
fe008|exactly.|S|Bmr019
mn017|because the person is addressing you directly and not everybody.|S|Bmr019
fe008|exactly.|S|Bmr019
fe008|exactly my point.|S|Bmr019
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr019
fe008|and so this is the expectation thing that uh uh|D|Bmr019
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe016|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|right.|B|Bmr019
mn017|right.|B|Bmr019
fe008|just the dyadic|D|Bmr019
fe008|but in addition you know if someone has done this analysis himself and isn't involved in the dyad but they might also give backchannels to verify what what the answer is that this that the the answerer's given|D|Bmr019
me013|i tell you i say i say uhhuh a lot.|S|Bmr019
fe016|right.|B|Bmr019
fe016|it's|D|Bmr019
fe008|there you go.|S|Bmr019
fe016|well but it's interesting.|S|Bmr019
fe016|because uh|D|Bmr019
me013|while people are talking to each other.|S|Bmr019
fe008|there you go.|S|Bmr019
fe016|but there are fewer i think there are fewer uhhuh.|S|Bmr019
fe008|yeah.|D|Bmr019
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe016|i mean just from we were looking at word frequency lists to try to find the cases that we would allow to have the reject words in between in doing the alignment.|S|Bmr019
fe016|you know the ones we wouldn't constrain to be next to the other words.|S|Bmr019
fe008|oh yeah.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and uhhuh is not as frequent.|S|Bmr019
fe016|as it sort of would be in switchboard.|S|Bmr019
fe016|if you looked at just a word frequency list of one word short utterances.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and yeah is way up there.|S|Bmr019
fe016|but not uhhuh.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and so i was thinking|D|Bmr019
fe016|it's not like you're being encouraged by everybody else to keep talking in the meeting.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and uh that's all i'll stop there.|S|Bmr019
fe016|because i think what you say makes a lot of sense.|S|Bmr019
fe008|well that's right.|S|Bmr019
fe008|and that would|D|Bmr019
fe008|well|D|Bmr019
fe016|but it was sort of|D|Bmr019
fe008|and what you say is the is the uh other side of this.|S|Bmr019
fe008|which is that you know so there are lots of channels where you don't have these backchannels when a question has been asked.|S|Bmr019
fe008|and and these|D|Bmr019
fe016|right.|B|Bmr019
fe016|there's just probably less backchanneling in general.|S|Bmr019
fe008|uhhuh.|D|Bmr019
fe008|so that's good news really.|S|Bmr019
fe016|even if you consider every other person altogether one person in the meeting.|S|Bmr019
fe016|but we'll find out anyway.|S|Bmr019
fe016|we were i guess the other thing we're we're i should say is that we're going to um try compare this type of overlap analysis to switchboard.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and callhome.|S|Bmr019
fe016|where|D|Bmr019
fe016|and callhome.|S|Bmr019
fe016|where we have both sides so that we can try to answer this question of you know is there really more overlap in meetings or is it just because we don't have the other channel in switchboard?|Q|Bmr019
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
fe016|and we don't know what people are doing.|S|Bmr019
fe016|try to create a paper out of that.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah i mean you folks have probably already told me.|S|Bmr019
me013|but were were you intending to do a eurospeech submission?|Q|Bmr019
me013|or|D|Bmr019
fe016|um you mean the one due tomorrow?|Q|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yeah well we're still like writing the scripts for doing the research.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and we will yes we're going to try.|S|Bmr019
fe008|uhhuh.|D|Bmr019
fe016|and i was telling don do not take this as an example of how people should work.|S|Bmr019
me013|do as i say.|S|Bmr019
me001|that's|D|Bmr019
fe016|so we will try.|S|Bmr019
me013|don't do as i do.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me011|well|F|Bmr019
fe016|it'll probably be a little late.|S|Bmr019
me011|it is different.|S|Bmr019
fe016|but i'm going to try it.|S|Bmr019
me011|in previous years eurospeech only had the abstract due by now.|S|Bmr019
me011|not the full paper.|S|Bmr019
me001|right.|D|Bmr019
fe016|right.|S|Bmr019
me011|and so all our timing was off.|S|Bmr019
me011|i've given up on trying to do digits.|S|Bmr019
me011|i just don't think that what i have so far makes a eurospeech paper.|S|Bmr019
fe016|well i'm we may be in the same position.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and i figured we'll try.|S|Bmr019
fe016|because that'll at least get us to the point where we have we have this really nice database format that andreas and i were working out that|D|Bmr019
fe016|it it's not very fancy.|S|Bmr019
fe016|it's just a ascii line by line format.|S|Bmr019
fe016|but it does give you information.|S|Bmr019
mn017|it's the it's the spurt format.|S|Bmr019
fe016|it yeah we're calling these spurts after chafe.|S|Bmr019
fe016|i was trying to find what's a word for a continuous region with pauses around it.|S|Bmr019
fe008|huh.|D|Bmr019
me013|yeah i know that the telecom people use use spurt for that.|S|Bmr019
fe008|good.|B|Bmr019
fe016|they do?|Q|Bmr019
mn017|oh.|S|Bmr019
me013|yes.|S|Bmr019
fe016|oh.|S|Bmr019
fe016|oh.|S|Bmr019
me013|and that's i mean i i was using that for a while when i was doing the rate of speech stuff.|S|Bmr019
fe016|i would|D|Bmr019
me013|because i because i looked up in some books and i found okay i want to find a spurt in which|D|Bmr019
fe016|uh right.|S|Bmr019
fe016|it's just like defined by the acoustics.|S|Bmr019
me013|and because because it's another question about how many pauses they put in between them.|S|Bmr019
me011|horrible.|S|Bmr019
fe016|right.|B|Bmr019
me013|but how fast do they do the words within the spurt?|Q|Bmr019
fe016|right.|B|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|D|Bmr019
me001|you know burst also?|Q|Bmr019
me011|it's going to|D|Bmr019
fe016|well that's what we were calling spurt.|S|Bmr019
me011|burst.|S|Bmr019
me001|isn't burst is used also?|Q|Bmr019
fe016|so|F|Bmr019
me011|spurt has the horrible name overloading with other with hardware at icsi.|S|Bmr019
me013|here.|S|Bmr019
me013|just very locally yeah.|S|Bmr019
me013|but but that just|D|Bmr019
fe016|well well chafe had this i think it was chafe or somebody had a the word spurt originally.|S|Bmr019
mn005|here|D|Bmr019
fe016|and so i|D|Bmr019
fe008|actually|D|Bmr019
fe016|but that's good to know.|S|Bmr019
fe016|was it's chafe?|Q|Bmr019
mn017|so maybe we should talk|D|Bmr019
fe008|well see i know sue wrote about spurts of development.|S|Bmr019
fe016|maybe it was sue|D|Bmr019
fe008|but in any case i think it's a good term.|S|Bmr019
me011|huh!|B|Bmr019
fe008|and uh|F|Bmr019
fe016|so we have spurts and we have spurt-ify dot shell and spurt-ify.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe008|and maybe maybe chafe did.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uh|F|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|so|D|Bmr019
fe008|i know i know chafe dealt with|D|Bmr019
fe016|and then it's got all it's a verb now.|S|Bmr019
me001|that's cool.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uh|D|Bmr019
fe008|chafe speaks about intonation units.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yes right.|S|Bmr019
fe008|but maybe he speaks about spurts as well.|S|Bmr019
fe008|and i just don't know.|S|Bmr019
fe008|yeah go ahead.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so what we're doing|D|Bmr019
me011|i've heard burst also.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uh this this is just maybe someone has some some ideas about how to do it better.|S|Bmr019
me001|huh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|but we so we're taking these uh alignments from the individual channels.|S|Bmr019
mn017|we're|D|Bmr019
mn017|from each alignment we're producing uh one of these c.t.m. files.|S|Bmr019
mn017|which essentially has it's just a linear sequence of words with the begin times for every word and the duration.|S|Bmr019
fe008|great.|B|Bmr019
mn017|and and and of course|D|Bmr019
fe016|it looks like a waves label file almost right?|S|Bmr019
mn017|right but it has one the first column has the meeting name.|S|Bmr019
fe016|it's just|D|Bmr019
mn017|so it could actually contain several meetings.|S|Bmr019
mn017|um|F|Bmr019
mn017|and the second column is the channel.|S|Bmr019
mn017|third column is the um start times of the words and the fourth column is the duration of the words.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and then we're|D|Bmr019
mn017|um|F|Bmr019
mn017|okay then we have a messy alignment process where we actually insert into the sequence of words the uh tags.|S|Bmr019
mn017|for like where where sentence ends of sentence.|S|Bmr019
mn017|question marks.|S|Bmr019
mn017|um various other things.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yeah these are things that we had don|D|Bmr019
mn017|uh|F|Bmr019
fe016|so don sort of um propagated the punctuation from the original transcriber.|S|Bmr019
mn017|right.|B|Bmr019
fe016|so whether it was like question mark or period or um you know comma and things like that.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and we kept the disfluency dashes uh kept those in because we sort of want to know where those are relative to the spurt overlaps.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|right.|B|Bmr019
mn017|so so those are actually sort of retro fitted into the time alignment.|S|Bmr019
fe016|overlaps.|S|Bmr019
fe016|or|F|Bmr019
mn017|and then we merge all the alignments from the various channels.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and we sort them by time.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and then there's a then there's a process where you now determine the spurts.|S|Bmr019
mn017|that is actually no you do that before you merge the various channels.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so you you identify by some criterion.|S|Bmr019
mn017|which is pause length.|S|Bmr019
mn017|you identify the beginnings and ends of these spurts.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and you put another set of tags in there to keep those straight.|S|Bmr019
me013|uhhuh.|D|Bmr019
mn017|and then you merge everything in terms of you know linearizing the sequence based on the time marks.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and then you extract the individual channels again.|S|Bmr019
mn017|but this time you know where the other people start and end talking.|S|Bmr019
mn017|you know where their spurts start and end.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and so you extract the individual channels uh one spurt by spurt as it were.|S|Bmr019
mn017|um and inside the words or between the words you now have begin and end tags for overlaps.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so you you basically have everything sort of lined up and in a form where you can look at the individual speakers and how their speech relates to the other speakers' speech.|S|Bmr019
me011|right.|B|Bmr019
fe016|uh i mean i think that's actually really useful also.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and|D|Bmr019
fe016|because even if you weren't studying overlaps if you want to get a transcription for the far field mikes how are you going to know which words from which speakers occurred at which times relative to each other?|Q|Bmr019
fe016|you have to be able to get a transcript like like this anyway just for doing far field recognition.|S|Bmr019
fe016|so|F|Bmr019
fe016|you know it's it's sort of|D|Bmr019
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe016|i it's just an issue we haven't dealt with before.|S|Bmr019
fe016|how you time align things that are overlapping anyway.|D|Bmr019
mn017|so|F|Bmr019
fe008|that's wonderful.|S|Bmr019
me011|well|D|Bmr019
mn017|and and we|D|Bmr019
fe016|i mean i never thought about it before.|S|Bmr019
me011|yes.|S|Bmr019
mn017|in|D|Bmr019
fe016|but|D|Bmr019
me011|i mean when i came up with the original data suggested data format based on the transcription graph there's capability of doing that sort of thing in there.|S|Bmr019
fe016|right.|S|Bmr019
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Bmr019
fe016|but you can't get it directly from the transcription.|S|Bmr019
mn017|right.|D|Bmr019
fe008|yeah that's right.|S|Bmr019
mn017|well this is this is just|D|Bmr019
fe016|yeah this is like a poor man's formatting version.|S|Bmr019
fe016|but it's you know it's clean.|S|Bmr019
fe016|it's just not fancy.|S|Bmr019
me011|right.|B|Bmr019
mn017|well there's lots of little things.|S|Bmr019
fe016|um|F|Bmr019
mn017|it's like there're twelve different scripts which you run.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and then at the end you have what you want.|S|Bmr019
mn017|but um|F|Bmr019
mn017|at the very last stage we throw away the actual time information.|S|Bmr019
mn017|all we care about is whether that there's a certain word was overlapped by someone else's word.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so you sort of at that point you discretize things into just having overlap or no overlap.|S|Bmr019
mn017|because we figure that's about the level of analysis that we want to do for this paper.|S|Bmr019
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|but if you wanted to do a more fine-grained analysis and say you know how far into the word is the overlap you could do that.|S|Bmr019
mn017|it's just it'll just require more|D|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr019
fe016|just sort of huge.|S|Bmr019
mn017|you know slightly different.|S|Bmr019
fe008|what's interesting is it's exactly what um in discussing with um sue about this.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe008|um she um indicated that that you know that's very important for overlap analysis.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yeah it's it's nice to know.|S|Bmr019
mn017|right.|D|Bmr019
fe016|and also i think as a human like i don't always hear these in the actual order that they occur.|D|Bmr019
fe016|so i can have two foreground speakers.|S|Bmr019
fe016|you know morgan and um adam and jane could all be talking.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and i could align each of them to be starting their utterance at the correct time.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and then look where they are relative to each other.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and that's not really what i heard.|S|Bmr019
fe008|and that's another thing she said.|S|Bmr019
fe016|because it's just hard to do.|S|Bmr019
fe008|this is this is bever's bever's effect.|S|Bmr019
fe008|when where in psycholinguistics you have these experiments where people have perceptual biases as to what they hear.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr019
fe016|it's sort of|D|Bmr019
fe008|that that not the best|D|Bmr019
fe016|yeah you sort of move things around until you get to a low information point.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and then you can bring in the other person.|S|Bmr019
fe016|so it's actually not even possible i think for any person to listen to a mixed signal.|S|Bmr019
fe016|even equalize and make sure that they have all the words in the right order.|S|Bmr019
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
fe016|so i guess we'll try to write this eurospeech paper.|S|Bmr019
fe008|superb.|S|Bmr019
fe016|i mean we will write it.|S|Bmr019
fe016|whether they accept it late or not i don't know.|S|Bmr019
fe016|um and the good thing is that we have it's sort of a beginning of what don can use to link the prosodic features from each file to each other.|S|Bmr019
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me013|yeah that's the good thing about these|D|Bmr019
mn017|plus|D|Bmr019
fe016|so|F|Bmr019
mn005|huh?|D|Bmr019
fe016|you know might as well.|S|Bmr019
fe016|i otherwise we won't get the work done on our deadline.|S|Bmr019
mn017|i don't know|D|Bmr019
mn017|i mean jane likes to look at data.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|maybe you know you could you could look at this format and see if you find anything interesting.|S|Bmr019
mn017|i don't know.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
fe008|well what i'm thinking is|D|Bmr019
me013|no it's that's the good thing about these paper deadlines and uh you know class projects and and things like that.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|D|Bmr019
fe016|right.|D|Bmr019
fe008|well my|D|Bmr019
mn017|well the other thing that that that that you usually don't tell your graduate students is that these deadlines are actually not that um you know strictly enforced.|S|Bmr019
me013|because you you really get|D|Bmr019
fe008|yeah.|D|Bmr019
fe016|forces you to do the work.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|D|Bmr019
fe016|exactly.|S|Bmr019
me011|strict.|S|Bmr019
mn017|because the|D|Bmr019
me013|oh now it's out in the public.|S|Bmr019
me013|this this this secret information.|S|Bmr019
mn017|because|D|Bmr019
fe008|i think we can|D|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
mn017|nah|D|Bmr019
fe016|right.|B|Bmr019
me011|no.|S|Bmr019
fe016|so|D|Bmr019
me013|no.|S|Bmr019
fe008|nah.|D|Bmr019
mn017|because these the conference organizers actually have an interest in getting lots of submissions.|S|Bmr019
fe016|right.|B|Bmr019
mn017|i mean a a monetary interest.|S|Bmr019
me011|right.|B|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|so um|F|Bmr019
me013|that's that's true.|S|Bmr019
fe008|and good ones.|S|Bmr019
fe008|good ones.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and good|D|Bmr019
fe008|which sometimes means a little extra time.|S|Bmr019
me013|that's|D|Bmr019
mn017|right.|B|Bmr019
mn017|well|D|Bmr019
me013|that's true.|S|Bmr019
mn017|that's another issue.|S|Bmr019
mn017|but|F|Bmr019
me013|by by the way this is totally unfair you may you may feel.|S|Bmr019
me013|but the the uh the morning meeting folks actually have an an extra month or so.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|D|Bmr019
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr019
me011|yep the aurora there's a special aurora|D|Bmr019
mn017|when|D|Bmr019
fe016|uh|D|Bmr019
me013|there's a special aurora session.|S|Bmr019
me013|and the aurora people involved in aurora have till uh early may or something to turn in their paper.|S|Bmr019
fe016|oh.|S|Bmr019
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr019
fe016|oh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|well then you can just|D|Bmr019
fe016|oh well maybe we'll submit to actually|D|Bmr019
mn017|maybe you can submit the digits paper on for the aurora session.|S|Bmr019
mn005|yeah.|D|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me011|oh i could!|S|Bmr019
me013|if it|D|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me011|i could submit that to aurora.|S|Bmr019
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me013|well|D|Bmr019
me011|that would be pretty pretty|D|Bmr019
me013|it has|D|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me011|that wouldn't work.|S|Bmr019
me013|no it wouldn't work.|S|Bmr019
me011|it's not aurora.|S|Bmr019
me013|it's it's not the aurora|D|Bmr019
me013|i mean it it's it's actually the aurora task.|S|Bmr019
fe016|maybe they'll get|D|Bmr019
me011|aurora's very specific.|S|Bmr019
fe016|well maybe it won't be after this deadline extension.|S|Bmr019
mn017|but but the people i mean|D|Bmr019
mn017|a a paper that is not on aurora would probably be more interesting at that point.|S|Bmr019
fe016|maybe they'll|D|Bmr019
mn017|because everybody's so sick and tired of the aurora task.|S|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me011|oh i thought you meant this was just the digits section.|S|Bmr019
me011|i didn't know you meant it was aurora digits.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|D|Bmr019
mn017|well no if you if you have it's to if you discuss some relation to the aurora task.|S|Bmr019
mn017|like if you use the same|D|Bmr019
me013|this is not the aurora task.|S|Bmr019
me013|so they just do a little grep for|D|Bmr019
fe016|do uh|D|Bmr019
mn017|um|D|Bmr019
fe016|do not do not we are not setting a good example.|S|Bmr019
mn017|well a relation other than negation maybe.|S|Bmr019
fe016|this is not a|D|Bmr019
mn017|um|F|Bmr019
mn017|so|F|Bmr019
mn017|i don't know.|S|Bmr019
fe016|anyway|D|Bmr019
fe016|but the good thing is this does|D|Bmr019
me011|well i don't know.|S|Bmr019
me011|i mean you could you could do a paper on what's wrong with the aurora task by comparing it to other ways of doing it.|S|Bmr019
mn017|how well does an aurora system do on on you know on digits collected in a in this environment?|Q|Bmr019
me011|different way.|S|Bmr019
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr019
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me013|maybe.|S|Bmr019
mn017|maybe.|S|Bmr019
me011|pretty hokey.|S|Bmr019
me013|i think it's a little farfetched.|S|Bmr019
me013|nah i mean the thing is aurora's pretty closed community.|S|Bmr019
me011|yep.|S|Bmr019
me013|i mean you know the people who were involved in the the only people who are allowed to test on that are people who who made it above a certain threshold in the first round.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me011|it's very specific.|S|Bmr019
me013|uh in ninety nine.|S|Bmr019
me013|and it's it's sort of a it's|D|Bmr019
mn017|well that's maybe why they don't know that they have a crummy system.|S|Bmr019
me013|not like a|D|Bmr019
mn017|i mean a crummy back end.|S|Bmr019
mn017|no i mean i mean seriously.|S|Bmr019
mn017|if you if you have a very|D|Bmr019
mn017|no i'm sorry.|S|Bmr019
fe016|uh beep!|S|Bmr019
mn017|no i didn't mean anybody any particular system.|S|Bmr019
me011|i mean|D|Bmr019
mn017|i meant this h.t.k. back end.|S|Bmr019
mn017|if they|D|Bmr019
me013|oh you don't like h.t. k?|S|Bmr019
mn005|yeah.|D|Bmr019
mn017|i don't i don't have any stock in h.t.k. or entropic or anything.|S|Bmr019
me013|no i mean this it's the h.t.k. that is trained on a very limited amount of data.|S|Bmr019
me011|it's it's very specific.|S|Bmr019
mn017|right.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
mn017|but so if you but maybe you should you know consider more using more data.|S|Bmr019
mn017|or i mean|D|Bmr019
me013|oh yeah i i really think that that's true.|S|Bmr019
mn017|if if you sort of hermetically stay within one task and don't look left and right then you're going to|D|Bmr019
me013|and they|D|Bmr019
me011|but they they had|D|Bmr019
me013|but|D|Bmr019
me011|they had something very specific in mind when they designed it right?|S|Bmr019
mn017|right.|S|Bmr019
me013|well|D|Bmr019
me011|and so so you can you can argue about maybe that wasn't the right thing to do.|S|Bmr019
me011|but you know they they they had something specific.|S|Bmr019
me013|but one of the reasons i have chuck's messing around with with the back end that you're not supposed to touch|D|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|i mean for the evaluations yes we'll run a version that hasn't been touched.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|but uh one of the reasons i have him messing around with that because i think it's sort of an open question that we don't know the answer to.|S|Bmr019
me013|people always say very glibly that if you show improvement on a bad system that doesn't mean anything.|S|Bmr019
me013|because it may not be show uh because you know it doesn't tell you anything about the good system.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|and i i've always sort of felt that that depends.|S|Bmr019
me013|you know that if some if you're actually are getting at something that has some conceptual substance to it it will port.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me013|and in fact most methods that people now use were originally tried with something that was not their absolute best system at some level.|S|Bmr019
me013|but of course sometimes it doesn't uh port.|S|Bmr019
me013|so i think that's that's an interesting question.|S|Bmr019
me013|if we're getting three percent error on uh uh english uh native speakers um using the aurora system and we do some improvements and bring it from three to two do those same improvements bring uh you know the s.r.i. system from one point three to you know to point eight|D|Bmr019
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|D|Bmr019
me011|zero.|S|Bmr019
me013|well|D|Bmr019
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr019
me013|you know so that's that's something we can test.|S|Bmr019
mn017|right.|S|Bmr019
me013|so|F|Bmr019
me013|anyway|D|Bmr019
mn017|okay.|D|Bmr019
me013|i think we've we've covered that one up extremely well.|S|Bmr019
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|whew!|S|Bmr019
me013|okay.|S|Bmr019
me013|so um|F|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr019
me013|so so we'll you know maybe you guys will have have one.|S|Bmr019
me013|uh you you and uh and dan have have a paper that that's going in.|S|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me013|you know that's that's pretty solid on the segmentation stuff.|S|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn014|i will send you the the final version.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me013|and the aurora folks here will will definitely get something in on aurora.|S|Bmr019
mn014|which is not|D|Bmr019
mn017|actually this this um so there's another paper.|S|Bmr019
me013|so|F|Bmr019
mn017|it's a eurospeech paper but not related to meetings.|S|Bmr019
mn017|but it's on digits.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so um|F|Bmr019
mn017|uh a colleague at s.r.i. developed a improved version of m.m.i.e. training.|S|Bmr019
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|and he tested it mostly on digits.|S|Bmr019
mn017|because it's sort of a you know it doesn't take weeks to train it.|S|Bmr019
me013|right.|B|Bmr019
mn017|um|F|Bmr019
mn017|and got some very impressive results um with you know discriminative uh gaussian training um you know like um error rates go from i don't know in very noisy environment like from|D|Bmr019
mn017|uh uh|F|Bmr019
mn017|i now i okay now i have the order of|D|Bmr019
mn017|i'm not sure about the order of magnitude.|S|Bmr019
mn017|was it like from ten percent to eight percent or from you know point you know from one percent to point eight percent?|Q|Bmr019
me013|it got it got better.|S|Bmr019
mn017|i mean it's a|D|Bmr019
mn017|it got better.|S|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr019
mn017|that's the important thing.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me011|hey that's the same percent relative.|S|Bmr019
mn017|but it's|D|Bmr019
me011|so|F|Bmr019
mn017|yeah right.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
mn017|it's uh something in|D|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|right.|S|Bmr019
me011|twenty percent relative gain.|S|Bmr019
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me013|um let's see.|S|Bmr019
me013|i think the only thing we had left was unless somebody else|D|Bmr019
me013|well there's a couple things.|S|Bmr019
me013|uh one is anything that um anybody has to say about saturday?|Q|Bmr019
me013|anything we should do in prep for saturday?|Q|Bmr019
me013|um|F|Bmr019
me013|i guess everybody knows about|D|Bmr019
me013|i mean um mari was asking was trying to come up with something like an agenda.|S|Bmr019
me013|and we're sort of fitting around people's times a bit.|S|Bmr019
me013|but um clearly when we actually get here we'll move things around this as we need to.|S|Bmr019
me013|but|F|Bmr019
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr019
me013|so you can't absolutely count on it.|S|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me013|but but uh|F|Bmr019
fe016|are we meeting in here probably?|Q|Bmr019
fe016|or|D|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr019
me013|that was my thought.|S|Bmr019
me013|i think this is|D|Bmr019
mn017|are we recording it?|Q|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe016|we won't have enough microphones.|S|Bmr019
me013|no i i hadn't intended to.|S|Bmr019
fe016|but|F|Bmr019
fe016|there's no way.|S|Bmr019
mn017|okay.|S|Bmr019
me013|we we want to i mean they're there's going to be uh jeff katrin mari and two students.|S|Bmr019
me013|so there's five from there.|S|Bmr019
me011|and brian.|S|Bmr019
mn017|but you know|D|Bmr019
me013|and brian's coming.|S|Bmr019
me013|so that's six.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me011|and plus all of us.|S|Bmr019
mn017|can use the oprah mike.|S|Bmr019
me013|uh|F|Bmr019
fe016|depends how fast you can throw it.|S|Bmr019
me011|it seems like too many too much coming and going.|S|Bmr019
fe016|it's just|D|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me013|well|D|Bmr019
fe016|we don't even have enough channel|D|Bmr019
mn017|because it would be a different kind of meeting.|S|Bmr019
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr019
mn017|that's what i'm|D|Bmr019
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me013|well|D|Bmr019
mn017|but|F|Bmr019
me013|i hadn't really thought of it.|S|Bmr019
mn017|maybe just maybe not the whole day.|S|Bmr019
me013|but|D|Bmr019
mn017|but just you know maybe some i mean|D|Bmr019
me013|maybe part of it.|S|Bmr019
mn017|part of it?|Q|Bmr019
me013|maybe part of it.|S|Bmr019
me011|make everyone read digits.|S|Bmr019
me013|at the same time.|S|Bmr019
me011|at the same time.|S|Bmr019
mn017|please.|S|Bmr019
fe016|at the same time.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
fe016|we|D|Bmr019
me013|i don't know.|S|Bmr019
fe016|that's their initiation into our|D|Bmr019
me011|into our our our cult.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yeah our yeah our|D|Bmr019
mn017|maybe the sections that are not right you know after lunch when everybody's still munching.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and|F|Bmr019
me013|okay.|S|Bmr019
fe016|so can you send out a schedule once you know it|D|Bmr019
me013|well|F|Bmr019
me013|okay yeah i guess i sent it around a little bit.|S|Bmr019
fe016|is is there a|D|Bmr019
fe016|there's a|D|Bmr019
me013|but|F|Bmr019
fe016|is it changed now or|D|Bmr019
me013|i hadn't heard back from mari after i i uh brought up the point about andreas's schedule.|S|Bmr019
me013|so um maybe when i get back there'll be some some mail from her.|S|Bmr019
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr019
me013|so i'll make a|D|Bmr019
fe008|i'm looking forward to seeing your representation.|S|Bmr019
fe008|that'd be uh|D|Bmr019
fe016|and we should get the two meetings from|D|Bmr019
fe008|i'd like to see that.|S|Bmr019
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr019
fe016|i mean i know about the first meeting.|S|Bmr019
fe016|um|F|Bmr019
fe016|but the other one that you did.|S|Bmr019
fe016|the n.s.a. one.|S|Bmr019
fe016|which we hadn't done because we weren't running recognition on it.|S|Bmr019
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
fe016|because the non native speaker|D|Bmr019
fe016|there were five non native speakers.|S|Bmr019
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
fe008|i see.|S|Bmr019
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
fe016|but it would be useful for the to see what we get with that one.|S|Bmr019
fe008|great.|S|Bmr019
fe016|so|F|Bmr019
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr019
fe008|it's uh two thousand eleven twenty one one thousand?|Q|Bmr019
fe016|yeah three.|S|Bmr019
fe016|right.|S|Bmr019
fe016|so|F|Bmr019
fe008|great.|S|Bmr019
fe008|i sent email when i finished the that one.|S|Bmr019
fe016|n.s.a. three i think.|S|Bmr019
fe008|that was sort of|D|Bmr019
fe008|yeah that's right that's right.|S|Bmr019
fe008|that's much simpler.|S|Bmr019
fe016|i don't know what they said.|S|Bmr019
fe016|but i know the number.|S|Bmr019
me013|that part's definitely going to confuse somebody who looks at these later.|S|Bmr019
mn017|right.|B|Bmr019
mn017|um|F|Bmr019
me013|i mean this is we're recording secret n.s.a. meetings.|S|Bmr019
mn017|not the|D|Bmr019
me013|i mean it's|D|Bmr019
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|uh|F|Bmr019
fe008|yeah not that n.s.a.|S|Bmr019
mn017|the the|D|Bmr019
me013|it's network services and applications.|S|Bmr019
fe016|they are hard to understand.|S|Bmr019
mn017|wait.|S|Bmr019
fe016|they're very uh out there.|S|Bmr019
mn017|the|D|Bmr019
fe016|i have no idea what they're talking about.|S|Bmr019
mn017|the um|F|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|the other good thing about the alignments is that um it's not always the machine's fault if it doesn't work.|S|Bmr019
mn017|so you can actually find um|D|Bmr019
fe016|it's the person's fault.|S|Bmr019
mn017|problem uh|D|Bmr019
fe016|it's morgan's fault.|S|Bmr019
mn017|you can find|D|Bmr019
mn017|you can find uh problems with with the transcripts.|S|Bmr019
me013|it's always morgan's fault.|S|Bmr019
mn017|um you know|F|Bmr019
me011|oh.|S|Bmr019
mn017|and go back and fix them.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr019
mn017|but|F|Bmr019
fe016|there are some cases like where the the wrong speaker uh these not a lot but where the the wrong person the the speech is attached to the wrong speaker.|S|Bmr019
fe016|and you can tell that when you run it.|S|Bmr019
fe016|or at least you can get clues to it.|S|Bmr019
fe008|interesting.|B|Bmr019
fe008|i guess it does|D|Bmr019
fe016|so these are from the early transcriptions that people did on the mixed signals like what you have.|S|Bmr019
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
fe008|it also raises the possibility of um using that kind of representation i mean i don't know this would be something we'd want to check but maybe using that representation for data entry.|S|Bmr019
fe008|and then displaying it on the channelized uh representation.|S|Bmr019
fe008|because it i think that the i mean my my preference in terms of like looking at the data is to see it in this kind of musical score format.|S|Bmr019
fe016|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
fe008|and also you know sue's preference as well.|S|Bmr019
fe016|yeah if you can get it to|D|Bmr019
fe008|and and|F|Bmr019
fe008|but i mean this if this is a better interface for making these kinds of uh you know local changes then that'd be fine too.|S|Bmr019
fe008|i don't i have no idea.|S|Bmr019
fe008|i think this is something that would need to be checked.|S|Bmr019
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me013|okay.|S|Bmr019
me013|the other thing i had actually was|D|Bmr019
me013|i i didn't realize this till today.|S|Bmr019
me013|but uh this is uh jose's last day.|S|Bmr019
mn005|is my last my last day.|S|Bmr019
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr019
fe016|oh!|S|Bmr019
mn017|oh!|S|Bmr019
fe008|oh!|S|Bmr019
mn005|my my last meeting about meetings.|S|Bmr019
me011|you're not going to be here tomorrow?|Q|Bmr019
me011|oh that's right.|S|Bmr019
mn005|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me011|tomorrow|D|Bmr019
mn005|because uh i leave uh the next sunday.|S|Bmr019
mn014|the last meeting meeting?|Q|Bmr019
me011|it's off.|S|Bmr019
mn005|i will come back to home to spain.|S|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
fe016|oh.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me013|i so i i|D|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
mn005|and i i would like to to to say thank you very much uh to all people in the group and at icsi.|S|Bmr019
fe016|oh.|B|Bmr019
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me011|it was good having you.|S|Bmr019
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr019
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr019
mn005|because i i enjoyed very much.|S|Bmr019
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr019
mn005|uh|F|Bmr019
mn005|and i'm sorry by the result of overlapping.|S|Bmr019
mn005|because uh i haven't good results uh yet.|S|Bmr019
mn005|but uh i i pretend to to continuing out to spain uh during the the following months.|S|Bmr019
mn005|uh because i have uh another ideas.|S|Bmr019
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr019
mn005|but uh i haven't enough time to to with six months it's not enough to to to research.|S|Bmr019
me011|yep.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
mn005|and i mean if uh the topic is uh so difficult.|S|Bmr019
mn005|uh in my opinion there isn't|D|Bmr019
me013|yeah maybe somebody else will come along and will be uh interested in working on it.|S|Bmr019
me013|and could start off from where you are also you know.|S|Bmr019
me013|they'd make use of of what you've done.|S|Bmr019
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
mn005|but uh i i will try to recommend uh at uh the spanish government.|S|Bmr019
mn005|but uh the following scholarship uh uh uh will be here more time.|S|Bmr019
mn005|because uh in my opinion is is better uh for us to to spend more time here.|S|Bmr019
mn005|and to work more time in a topic.|S|Bmr019
mn005|no?|Q|Bmr019
me013|yeah it's a very short time.|S|Bmr019
mn005|but uh|F|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
me011|yeah six months is hard.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
mn005|yeah it is.|S|Bmr019
me011|i think a year is a lot better.|S|Bmr019
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
mn005|it's difficult.|S|Bmr019
mn005|you you have uh you are lucky.|S|Bmr019
mn005|and you you find a solution in in in some few uh months uh?|S|Bmr019
mn005|okay.|S|Bmr019
mn005|but uh i think it's not uh common.|S|Bmr019
mn005|but uh anyway thank you.|S|Bmr019
mn005|thank you very much.|S|Bmr019
mn005|uh i i bring the chocolate uh to to tear uh with with you.|S|Bmr019

fe016|oh.|S|Bmr019
fe008|nice.|S|Bmr019
mn005|uh.|F|Bmr019
mn005|i i hope if you need uh something uh from us in the future i i will be at spain to you help.|S|Bmr019
mn005|uh|F|Bmr019
me011|great.|S|Bmr019
me013|well|D|Bmr019
fe008|great.|S|Bmr019

mn005|and thank you very much.|S|Bmr019
mn017|have a good trip.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr019
mn005|thank you.|S|Bmr019
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|keep in touch.|S|Bmr019
me013|yeah.|D|Bmr019
me013|okay.|F|Bmr019
me013|i guess uh unless somebody has something else we'll read read our digits.|S|Bmr019
me011|digits?|Q|Bmr019
me013|and we'll get our|D|Bmr019
mn014|uh|D|Bmr019
me011|are we going to do them simultaneously?|Q|Bmr019
mn014|oops.|S|Bmr019
me013|get our last bit of uh jose's jose jose's digit.|S|Bmr019
me011|or|D|Bmr019
mn005|you uh|D|Bmr019
me013|uh i'm sorry?|Q|Bmr019
mn005|you prefer uh to eat uh chocolate uh at the coffee break uh at the or you prefer now before after|D|Bmr019
fe008|well we have a time|D|Bmr019
mn017|no we prefer to keep it for ourselves.|S|Bmr019
mn014|during|D|Bmr019
mn017|yeah yeah.|S|Bmr019
fe008|well we have a a time time constraint.|S|Bmr019
mn014|during digits.|S|Bmr019
me013|so keep it away from that end of the table.|S|Bmr019
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr019
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr019
mn005|yeah.|D|Bmr019
