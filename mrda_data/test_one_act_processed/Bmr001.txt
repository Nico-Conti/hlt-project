me011|okay so we're live.|S|Bmr001
me013|okay.|S|Bmr001
me011|are we live or are we memorex?|Q|Bmr001
me013|we're somewhere in between.|S|Bmr001
me025|okay so that's|D|Bmr001
me013|okay so we have some sheets for uh some standard doohickies to|D|Bmr001
me025|wait.|S|Bmr001
me011|right so|F|Bmr001
me025|you're going to sit there?|Q|Bmr001
me011|is that all right?|Q|Bmr001
me025|yeah okay.|S|Bmr001
me025|maybe i'll put this thing here then.|S|Bmr001
me011|okay.|S|Bmr001
me013|okay so this is february second uh two thousand.|S|Bmr001
me013|this is uh meeting number one with adam and dan and morgan about five o'clock uh in the afternoon.|S|Bmr001
me013|a range of microphones.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|what's this one here?|Q|Bmr001
me013|this this one is has a couple of cheezy electrettes and|D|Bmr001
me025|yeah that's that's the dummy dummy p d a.|S|Bmr001
me013|that's connected too or|D|Bmr001
me011|yep.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah it is.|S|Bmr001
me013|that's connected.|S|Bmr001
me011|yeah both channels.|S|Bmr001
me013|it's got two to both channels.|S|Bmr001
me025|oh hang on.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|yeah it is at the moment.|S|Bmr001
me013|okay.|B|Bmr001
me025|yep.|B|Bmr001
me013|okay.|B|Bmr001
me013|this is|D|Bmr001
me011|although the gain is pretty low.|S|Bmr001
me011|so for the um read numbers task i have extracted these|D|Bmr001
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me025|hang on let's let's okay let's just let's just name the microphones.|S|Bmr001
me011|okay.|S|Bmr001
me025|so i'm speaking on the ear mounted uh wired headset thing.|S|Bmr001
me025|okay.|B|Bmr001
me011|right and i'm now talking on microphone number two.|S|Bmr001
me011|uh the wireless microphone number two.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|S|Bmr001
me013|um i have no idea which one i'm i'm on.|S|Bmr001
me011|i'm|D|Bmr001
me013|oh one!|S|Bmr001
me025|you're on one.|S|Bmr001
me013|oh i'm number one.|S|Bmr001
me025|absolutely.|S|Bmr001
me013|okay which is a a a lapel.|S|Bmr001
me013|in fact it's sticking through my lapel.|S|Bmr001
me025|yes.|B|Bmr001
me025|okay so this is this is the p z m nearest the uh uh the machine room end of the table.|S|Bmr001
me011|actually|D|Bmr001
me025|then there's|D|Bmr001
me025|i know but yeah.|S|Bmr001
me025|it's number three it says but we'll be able to figure it out.|S|Bmr001
me025|this is at the middle of the table.|S|Bmr001
me025|this further down the table.|S|Bmr001
me025|and this this one is right at the end of the table.|S|Bmr001
me025|okay?|Q|Bmr001
me025|and then we've got the uh|D|Bmr001
me025|this is the left side of the dummy p d a and this would be the right side.|S|Bmr001
me013|i think listening to this is going to be like watching somebody's home movies.|S|Bmr001
me011|yes it'll be pretty horrible.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah okay.|D|Bmr001
me025|very exciting.|S|Bmr001
me011|so what i have on these forms here is for the read numbers read digits tasks and it's extracted directly from aurora.|S|Bmr001
me011|and uh|F|Bmr001
me011|so what i was thinking is we could start just by filling it out and then reading reading the numbers on the form.|S|Bmr001
me013|okay what do we do with the stuff on top?|S|Bmr001
me011|fill it out.|S|Bmr001
me013|but i|D|Bmr001
me013|do we say it after we|D|Bmr001
me025|no.|S|Bmr001
me011|no you don't need to.|S|Bmr001
me025|just write it down.|S|Bmr001
me013|what are we why are we writing it down?|Q|Bmr001
me011|so that when we transcribe the data we can figure out who said it and their gender and the date and the time and what mike they were on and all that sort of thing.|S|Bmr001
me013|oh.|S|Bmr001
me013|okay that's good.|S|Bmr001
me013|so i don't need to fill that out right now.|S|Bmr001
me013|so maybe we should just say it.|S|Bmr001
me011|why don't you want to fill it out right now?|Q|Bmr001
me025|okay.|F|Bmr001
me011|just so that|D|Bmr001
me013|so then we're not spending the time writing it out.|S|Bmr001
me013|so that we're spending the time talking.|S|Bmr001
me025|well how about you give me one of those.|S|Bmr001
me025|and we can fill it out.|S|Bmr001
me025|and morgan can read.|S|Bmr001
me025|and then we can do it like that.|S|Bmr001
me013|i'm just uh concerned about a bunch of dead time while we all sit here and fill out the things.|S|Bmr001
me011|okay.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah yeah yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|right?|D|Bmr001
me011|and so you have to be sure to pause between each line since we're going to be segmenting it and then doing it that way.|S|Bmr001
me013|oh.|B|Bmr001
me013|right.|S|Bmr001
me013|okay so this is morgan.|S|Bmr001
me013|i'm going to read some numbers now.|S|Bmr001
me013|that's my group.|S|Bmr001
me011|so i definitely wasn't pausing enough between them.|S|Bmr001
me025|this is these are things we will find out.|S|Bmr001
me011|that'll be an issue.|S|Bmr001
me011|yep.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|i don't know if i said mine was transcript zero.|S|Bmr001
me013|but it was.|S|Bmr001
me011|uhhuh!|D|Bmr001
me013|oh good.|S|Bmr001
me025|okay.|B|Bmr001
me013|okay.|B|Bmr001
me013|that's a little bit.|S|Bmr001
me025|can i have something to write on the back of?|Q|Bmr001
me013|so so where are we in this?|Q|Bmr001
me025|thanks.|S|Bmr001
me013|let's see so we now we now have a few mikes that work.|S|Bmr001
me013|how long did it take you to set this up?|Q|Bmr001
me025|oh!|S|Bmr001
me025|it didn't doesn't take well i mean as you see we haven't really set it up that well but it doesn't it doesn't take long to set up.|S|Bmr001
me025|i mean we just came up here one night after recording so it took like twenty minutes something like that.|S|Bmr001
me011|right and that that included a fair amount of fiddling around since it's it's more or less the first time we've tried to do it.|S|Bmr001
me025|i mean it's|F|Bmr001
me025|yeah i mean the equipment|D|Bmr001
me025|right.|F|Bmr001
me025|the me and adam went through it yesterday just looked at everything.|S|Bmr001
me025|but it's all kind of here and set up so it's just a question of turning it all on.|S|Bmr001
me025|and um running the program.|S|Bmr001
me011|i mean eventually we'll want to like tape that over and run them up through the center so that wires aren't aren't people aren't tripping over the wires and so on.|S|Bmr001
me025|right.|B|Bmr001
me013|are we going to i mean is it going to be over there or is it going to be in there?|Q|Bmr001
me025|um it's it's going to it's for reasons because of the microphones runs we want that chunk there.|S|Bmr001
me025|there's more equipment in there.|S|Bmr001
me025|but there's the idea is that there are these microphones on the table.|S|Bmr001
me025|there are some cables coming down sort of under a nice mat.|S|Bmr001
me025|and then that's they a bunch of them get sort of converged with digital there.|S|Bmr001
me025|and the idea is that this gets replaced by a cabinet with doors so that so that it's not open to fiddling.|S|Bmr001
me013|so that's what's going to happen.|S|Bmr001
me011|right.|S|Bmr001
me025|that's|D|Bmr001
me011|do we have like a cabinet on order or do we just need to do that?|Q|Bmr001
me025|we need to do that.|S|Bmr001
me025|it's on a list of things to do.|S|Bmr001
me025|i keep on hoping that they're going to get done but they don't.|S|Bmr001
me011|well i i can help them get done um one question is budget.|S|Bmr001
me025|i|D|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|do we have any money at all that we can go out and spend on things like cabinets or a hard drive or things like that?|Q|Bmr001
me013|oh i mean i don't know.|S|Bmr001
me013|did we did we spend our the budget already that we had?|Q|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|S|Bmr001
me013|uh how much are we talking about here?|Q|Bmr001
me025|um i don't know.|S|Bmr001
me025|a cabinet is probably going to cost a hundred dollars two hundred dollars something like that.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah i mean you know we we can spend under a thousand dollars or something without without worrying about it.|S|Bmr001
me025|i mean|F|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|i mean i think um i'm more worried about things being kept in a funky state long enough that that uh stuff gets broken or or you know.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|well i think our intention at this point is when we're not using it to record a meeting we'll coil them all up and put them under so that people will not be tripping over them and so on.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|so|F|Bmr001
me025|but well we should get to a a nice kind of working state of our set up as quickly as possible.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah and there's also the minor matter it'd be kind of nice to able to bring people in and say yes this is where we do such and such and then be able to see uh you know some kind of i mean it's less important than doing what we're doing right now.|S|Bmr001
me011|right.|S|Bmr001
me011|not have it|D|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|but|F|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|so|F|Bmr001
me025|i mean there's one big issue with the equipment still which is um ultimately we're going to well the idea is to have any number of these wired headsets.|S|Bmr001
me025|but there's this amplification problem.|S|Bmr001
me025|i built this thing it's that's it's very noisy.|S|Bmr001
me025|we're actually recording i'm i'm going through it at the moment but it's so noisy that i am not using for this.|S|Bmr001
me025|it's it's designed to be used for the for the desktop meeting as well.|S|Bmr001
me025|but i'm using running that through my uh damp machine as a pre amp as an alternative.|S|Bmr001
me013|well we should be able to just go buy some preamps i would think.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|S|Bmr001
me025|it's just it uh|D|Bmr001
me025|you see how clumsy this is.|S|Bmr001
me025|right?|Q|Bmr001
me025|i have to use these batteries to bias them.|S|Bmr001
me025|and i'm only get two channels and there're a bunch of there are like three connectors in the circuit.|S|Bmr001
me025|the thing is like it's it's not it's not that the thing doesn't exist commercially but there isn't one unit which does the whole thing in one in one swoop.|S|Bmr001
me025|so it seemed like it was a good idea to make one.|S|Bmr001
me025|um and i'm still not sure.|S|Bmr001
me025|i mean i think i probably know how to fix this.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|i can probably build it better so it doesn't have such noise but it's kind of a buy.|S|Bmr001
me011|well ultimately we're going to need to build one anyway.|S|Bmr001
me013|are we?|Q|Bmr001
me011|sure.|S|Bmr001
me025|well we could just|D|Bmr001
me011|because we're going to have to put it in a p d a.|S|Bmr001
me013|well|D|Bmr001
me011|right?|Q|Bmr001
me011|if we have microphones in a p d a it's going to need bias and a pre amp.|S|Bmr001
me013|i guess i'd sort of figured that that jim would do that at some point.|S|Bmr001
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me013|right?|Q|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|S|Bmr001
me025|well|D|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|S|Bmr001
me025|jim is busy at the moment.|S|Bmr001
me025|that's the problem.|S|Bmr001
me025|i was kind of hoping that jim was going to build this box.|S|Bmr001
me025|but um but he hasn't had time.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|well i think i think he is quite interested in doing it.|S|Bmr001
me025|but|F|Bmr001
me013|okay.|B|Bmr001
me013|well if it's too noisy and if there's something we can buy again for you know moderate amount of price even if it takes a couple boxes or something maybe we should just do it.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|and then and then later we can uh replace it with|D|Bmr001
me013|because there may be other considerations that will go into the design.|S|Bmr001
me013|i mean uh our getting some experience with this may help to determine some of things that are i don't know might change this design so.|S|Bmr001
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me011|right.|B|Bmr001
me013|there was uh a statement made uh which i don't think is right by the way but there was a statement made at the uh darpa communicator meeting i was at recently that um microphone multiple microphones at a distance of less than three feet or something like that were totally useless.|S|Bmr001
me013|completely irrelevant.|S|Bmr001
me025|oh!|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|you you mean for noise cancelling or|D|Bmr001
me013|for noise cancelling.|S|Bmr001
me013|um my counter argument is is an uh uh um a white rat.|S|Bmr001
me013|uh which has it's two microphones exceedingly close together and it works pretty well.|S|Bmr001
me025|oh.|B|Bmr001
me013|um but yeah.|F|Bmr001
me025|okay.|B|Bmr001
me025|this happened.|S|Bmr001
me011|do they mean omnidirectional?|Q|Bmr001
me011|is that their point?|Q|Bmr001
me011|i mean all the noise cancelling mikes they're you know they're a few millimeters away from each other pointing in different directions.|S|Bmr001
me025|i think uh i mean uh my guess is that means it's just that if it's if it's near field the mathematics of beam beam steering is different.|S|Bmr001
me011|but|D|Bmr001
me011|oh i see.|S|Bmr001
me025|if the if the wavefronts are not approximately planar then you can't just do delay and sum and expect it to work.|S|Bmr001
me011|it's oh okay so they're not talking about how far apart the mikes are they're talking about how far they are from the speaker.|S|Bmr001
me025|i guess.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|S|Bmr001
me013|right.|F|Bmr001
me013|but i think that if my point is i guess if you if you have a um a uh a volume in between the two the two uh uh sensors and you do something cleverer there clearly are ways to get more out of it.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|right right right.|S|Bmr001
me025|i mean the um the the weird thing is that actually delay in some beam forming is not is not the clever thing to do.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|the the the underwater guys do this stuff which is different.|S|Bmr001
me025|and it actually means that you should get the microphones as close together as possible.|S|Bmr001
me025|rather than trying to get them far apart so you can get separation you sort of you want them very close.|S|Bmr001
me025|and and the math is too difficult for me to understand but it's but it's there.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|well there are various points in meeting where people were making uh uh very strong statements as a matter of fact like one shouldn't even question it.|S|Bmr001
me013|and this was one of them that was kind of funny.|S|Bmr001
me013|um but i i i what i take it to mean is doing doing the dumb thing uh with two microphones would be very difficult to get too much out of it.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|but i think it will be interesting to do other things that aren't dumb.|S|Bmr001
me013|so i i still think it's potentially interesting to do that.|S|Bmr001
me011|huh.|B|Bmr001
me013|although we'll have to be uh aware of this if we're writing proposals about it wherever that there may well be reviewers who will say well everyone knows that you can't get anything out of it if it's if it's close.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|do they believe you can get speaker location out of it?|Q|Bmr001
me011|because that's that's one way we could sneak it in.|S|Bmr001
me013|uh that is an interesting point.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|certainly you can get some|D|Bmr001
me025|well we could i mean|D|Bmr001
me025|by the time we'll have we'll have data so we can actually you know demonstrate that.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|well|F|Bmr001
me013|hopefully.|S|Bmr001
me011|oh you mean for location?|Q|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|S|Bmr001
me011|okay.|S|Bmr001
me013|well we're getting some we're getting some right now.|S|Bmr001
me011|depends on who's working on it.|S|Bmr001
me011|yeah right.|S|Bmr001
me011|but someone has to write some software to to actually do it.|S|Bmr001
me025|right.|B|Bmr001
me025|right.|B|Bmr001
me025|but i mean|D|Bmr001
me013|well someone someone might be interested in in it.|S|Bmr001
me011|someone might.|S|Bmr001
me011|oh that's uh|D|Bmr001
me011|i was just thinking one thing we may want to do is put the fake p d a right in front of someone instead of in the middle of the table like we have it now.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|on the thought that my vision of it is you know each of us will have our little p d a in front of us and so the acoustics uh you might want to try to match the acoustics.|S|Bmr001
me013|maybe.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|but on the other hand suppose that uh you're the only one uh who is advanced enough in this thinking to actually bring such a p d a to to a meeting.|S|Bmr001
me011|no and i don't need to meet with those people.|S|Bmr001
me013|and and and therefore you bring it in.|S|Bmr001
me013|and you probably want it to be as near to people as possible so you might in fact shove it to the middle of the table.|S|Bmr001
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me013|well|F|Bmr001
me025|yep yep.|S|Bmr001
me025|for those those we can make several several more of these and then we can have actual recording with you know three p d as.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr001
me013|well i think we should.|S|Bmr001
me013|i mean i think at least with two.|S|Bmr001
me025|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me013|right?|Q|Bmr001
me011|right.|S|Bmr001
me013|because uh one of the one of the fantasies that was at least fun to talk about was that uh|D|Bmr001
me013|uh okay maybe you you're the range of things you can do with multiple microphones is limited if they're a few inches apart.|S|Bmr001
me013|but what if you have two of these things|D|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|and you know we have this this idea of the handshake back and forth and say i'm here i'm here.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|right.|B|Bmr001
me013|we're now an array.|S|Bmr001
me025|right right.|B|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|F|Bmr001
me025|and that that seems very uh easy to believe scenario i mean given the number of palm pilots we've got on the table right now so|D|Bmr001
me011|that's right.|S|Bmr001
me011|three.|S|Bmr001
me011|right?|Q|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr001
me011|so i guess this a pretty dense group.|S|Bmr001
me011|but it's getting a lot higher.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah but but that it's|D|Bmr001
me025|we're not even you know it's we're just it's not like we we we may be technical but we're not particularly p d a people.|S|Bmr001
me025|so it's that's just how it is.|S|Bmr001
me011|well i'm trying to be.|S|Bmr001
me011|so|F|Bmr001
me025|well i know.|S|Bmr001
me025|well that's true.|S|Bmr001
me025|i mean|F|Bmr001
me011|except i got a p d a way before|D|Bmr001
me011|well i was doing i was doing wearable computers at boeing so i guess i sort of count.|S|Bmr001
me025|okay.|B|Bmr001
me011|but|F|Bmr001
me013|so uh so where are we uh now?|Q|Bmr001
me013|i mean so we've just uh we're doing this recording so we show we can we're capable of doing recording.|S|Bmr001
me025|right.|B|Bmr001
me013|uh there's i guess a little more wiring to do or something to have to have more if we had more people participating in the meeting we'd wouldn't quite be ready for that.|S|Bmr001
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me013|uh.|B|Bmr001
me025|well we've got we've got right now we could have two more people on wireless.|S|Bmr001
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me025|with a trip to leo's audio we could get a third extra person on wireless.|S|Bmr001
me025|and uh right now we could have three more three more people wearing mikes like this and that would just work.|S|Bmr001
me025|i mean i'm not sure how how good the quality is on this mike but i think it's going to be okay.|S|Bmr001
me025|so we could actually have eight people with with headset mikes with i mean basically no extra effort.|S|Bmr001
me011|well five with wireless.|S|Bmr001
me011|so we could have eight.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|S|Bmr001
me025|nine.|S|Bmr001
me011|nine.|S|Bmr001
me011|excuse me nine.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|five with wireless and four without and four with wired.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|um we don't have headsets though.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|F|Bmr001
me025|we have the um the ones we've been using the ones we got for the p c.|S|Bmr001
me011|oh okay so we just have to wander around and collect them up.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah yeah.|S|Bmr001
me025|i think we have three of those.|S|Bmr001
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me025|so and the|D|Bmr001
me011|uh there's one in my office.|S|Bmr001
me011|so|F|Bmr001
me025|right right.|B|Bmr001
me025|they don't all work but the nice ones the um plantronic ones work.|S|Bmr001
me013|okay.|S|Bmr001
me011|so we'll just have to see if that works.|S|Bmr001
me013|so a little bit of futzing there's the issue about a cabinet we might want to change some pre amps.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|S|Bmr001
me013|so we can do some more recordings but there's there's a little little bit of ramp up on that over the next month say.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|right and also i would like to work out some of the software issues a little more completely.|S|Bmr001
me011|so um you know we're going to want to resample and and bring them over to another machine and uh um organize the how we're going to store it all.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|yeah we were talking about that a little bit over coffee today that that um uh if you downsample it sounded like it came it sounded like it was something like a gigabyte an hour if you didn't downsample.|S|Bmr001
me013|and once you downsampled then it was something like four hundred megabytes an hour if you used all if you used all|D|Bmr001
me025|per channel or|D|Bmr001
me013|no if you used all the channels.|S|Bmr001
me013|something like that?|Q|Bmr001
me025|we figured out that it was twelve twelve gigabytes an hour.|S|Bmr001
me011|it was more than that.|S|Bmr001
me025|for for all the channels.|S|Bmr001
me025|was that with or without the|D|Bmr001
me013|i thought it was one gigabyte.|S|Bmr001
me013|it couldn't be twelve.|S|Bmr001
me025|because no we've only no i mean we've only got four gigabytes and that|D|Bmr001
me011|we said four gigabytes would give us twenty minutes before we did anything else.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|right.|S|Bmr001
me025|and then we then we cut it in half.|S|Bmr001
me011|and then we cut in half by|D|Bmr001
me013|how'd you cut it?|Q|Bmr001
me025|but by saving sixteen bits on instead of thirty instead of thirty two.|S|Bmr001
me013|okay so that's so that's two gigabytes.|S|Bmr001
me013|and then|D|Bmr001
me025|well no i mean it's uh four gigabytes for forty minutes.|S|Bmr001
me011|that's forty minutes.|S|Bmr001
me013|right.|S|Bmr001
me011|so six gigabytes.|S|Bmr001
me013|but that's at forty four kilohertz with sixteen channels.|S|Bmr001
me025|forty eight kilohertz yeah.|S|Bmr001
me025|so we can actually triple that.|S|Bmr001
me013|so you can|D|Bmr001
me013|right so you can|D|Bmr001
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|so hang on.|S|Bmr001
me025|so that would okay|D|Bmr001
me011|i came out at the gig an hour at one point.|S|Bmr001
me011|that that's one computation i did for sixteen channels sixteen bit.|S|Bmr001
me025|well i think it's i think it's two gig an hour.|S|Bmr001
me011|is it two gig an hour?|Q|Bmr001
me011|i'm off by an order of|D|Bmr001
me011|that's all right.|S|Bmr001
me011|order of two.|S|Bmr001
me025|because like we don't maybe we don't we don't need to save all channels.|S|Bmr001
me011|factor of two.|S|Bmr001
me025|right?|Q|Bmr001
me025|so on average we could we don't we we wouldn't use all the channels necessarily.|S|Bmr001
me013|oh we'll do the higher math later maybe but it's so it's so maybe like a gig or two a an hour.|S|Bmr001
me013|um but um|F|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|okay that is a bit more than i thought.|S|Bmr001
me011|how much here would we have to reformat the drive in there to get some of the more space?|Q|Bmr001
me011|because it i mean it's a nine gig drive and there's four gig on on scratch and there's about three gig unused it looked like on the home directory.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|i'm sure.|B|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|i just don't know enough about linux.|S|Bmr001
me011|how hard is it to repartition?|Q|Bmr001
me025|it's a pain.|S|Bmr001
me011|it's a pain.|S|Bmr001
me025|i mean you know because because we've got data on user.|S|Bmr001
me025|right?|Q|Bmr001
me025|and then we'd have to back it all up and copy it back on again.|S|Bmr001
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me013|yeah so this'll take some thought because we have we um|D|Bmr001
me013|if we are in fact going to have forty or fifty hours at some point and we we want to have part of our work be on feature extraction it means that we need to have waveforms available somehow.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|huh.|B|Bmr001
me011|right.|B|Bmr001
me011|so i've i've already created a u u doctor speech data m r directory or had jane do it and uh um but there's not a lot of free space around.|S|Bmr001
me025|no.|S|Bmr001
me011|so it it it has currently about four gig on the drive that i think she's going to put it on um.|S|Bmr001
me025|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me025|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me011|and so we need we definitely need to go buy uh you know forty gig fifty gig of drive drive space.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|we don't need all we don't necessarily need it all online.|S|Bmr001
me025|i mean it will be different subsets.|S|Bmr001
me025|so you won't you won't you know do all sixteen channels in a single|D|Bmr001
me011|that's true.|S|Bmr001
me011|i hadn't even thought about that although it'd be kind of interesting.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|what would you do?|Q|Bmr001
me025|you typically train i mean you'd have you'd have fifty hours.|S|Bmr001
me013|i mean|D|Bmr001
me025|we'd only use one of the p z m channels.|S|Bmr001
me025|something like this.|S|Bmr001
me025|and so that would you wouldn't have to use all sixteen channels at once.|S|Bmr001
me025|but it's kind of painful for because basically if we put them on c ds then each c d will have all the channels for one recording.|S|Bmr001
me025|and then when you want to build the p files you just want to get one of those files off each of the sessions.|S|Bmr001
me025|and|F|Bmr001
me011|yeah it's pretty horrible.|S|Bmr001
me013|so what would we do for training?|Q|Bmr001
me013|so if we're if we're training distant we'd just use one of them?|Q|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|S|Bmr001
me025|well maybe two of them but i mean we wouldn't use we'd only use the distant mikes.|S|Bmr001
me013|okay.|S|Bmr001
me025|right?|Q|Bmr001
me011|yeah so it might be four.|S|Bmr001
me011|right?|Q|Bmr001
me011|but it wouldn't be sixteen.|S|Bmr001
me013|well although we wanted to get alignments from the close mike stuff.|S|Bmr001
me011|but that's a separate training.|S|Bmr001
me013|right.|S|Bmr001
me013|but you don't want to be constantly take putting that on disk and off disk and on disk.|S|Bmr001
me011|no wait.|S|Bmr001
me011|more disk is better.|S|Bmr001
me011|absolutely.|S|Bmr001
me011|i mean my my preference would be to get get ourselves a hundred gig of disk.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|the thing is it's really not very expensive right now.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|and just not bother.|S|Bmr001
me013|so it's more of an issue of of structuring it with uh the uh sys admin folks so we don't panic them and figuring out where it goes.|S|Bmr001
me011|and back up.|S|Bmr001
me013|well we don't it doesn't need to be backed up.|S|Bmr001
me025|right if if we if we burn it all on c d rom then um|D|Bmr001
me011|right then it doesn't need to be backed up.|S|Bmr001
me025|in fact we could you know we could throw away the broadcast news stuff and put it on there or something like that.|S|Bmr001
me011|yeah we were talking about that.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|i'm not sure if anyone's still using it.|S|Bmr001
me013|i think the only one using it has been javier.|S|Bmr001
me025|somebody used it recently.|S|Bmr001
me013|but at this point i think it's he's only been using it for features that he calculated quite a while ago.|S|Bmr001
me013|so if nobody else is doing feature calculation|D|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|i'll send mail to speech local.|S|Bmr001
me013|pardon?|Q|Bmr001
me011|i'll send mail to speech local and see if anyone's still using it.|S|Bmr001
me013|how much space is that using up?|Q|Bmr001
me013|do you have any idea?|D|Bmr001
me025|it's uh twenty c ds.|S|Bmr001
me025|so that's twelve gigabytes.|S|Bmr001
me011|so that would last us for a while.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah couple hours.|S|Bmr001
me013|well anyway for this this recording we're fine.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|because we're only we're only|D|Bmr001
me013|how many mikes are we recording right now?|Q|Bmr001
me011|well right now we don't have any choice.|S|Bmr001
me011|it still records all sixteen channels.|S|Bmr001
me011|it's just most of them are all zeroes.|S|Bmr001
me011|so that that's on our list too.|S|Bmr001
me013|okay.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah well that we can do something about.|D|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|yep.|B|Bmr001
me011|it's mostly a question of user interface.|S|Bmr001
me011|how do we how do we specify which ones are on?|Q|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|yeah so we don't store any of our audio formats compressed in any way.|S|Bmr001
me011|do we?|Q|Bmr001
me011|so these large sections when you guys aren't talking|D|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|F|Bmr001
me025|probably we could we could probably just run shorten on them or something and it will get a big win.|S|Bmr001
me025|i think that's a good|D|Bmr001
me011|run what on those?|Q|Bmr001
me025|shorten.|S|Bmr001
me025|tony robinson's uh lossless compression thing.|S|Bmr001
me011|okay.|S|Bmr001
me013|what's it do?|Q|Bmr001
me025|um it it does a r modeling|D|Bmr001
me025|and so it looks at a section it runs an a r model to sort of to whiten it and then quantizes the residual with a nice with the three bits it can get away with.|S|Bmr001
me025|something like that.|S|Bmr001
me025|so i think it on on each block it'll it'll compress you know if there's load on in any range it'll use ratio bits.|S|Bmr001
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me025|i think it does that.|S|Bmr001
me011|yeah so p z ms.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah well|D|Bmr001
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|yeah it's something that that we definitely need to look at with this.|S|Bmr001
me011|maybe we shouldn't have subsampled it down to sixteen bits for our first try.|S|Bmr001
me025|well it's okay.|S|Bmr001
me025|it's only the first try.|S|Bmr001
me025|i what i'm thinking is um obviously we can do the we can we can choose any sixteen bits from the twenty four so we can just have different gain things that we use you know per channel.|S|Bmr001
me011|right.|B|Bmr001
me011|yeah so we might want to see if maybe the low sixteen bits on the p z ms are better than the middle sixteen bits.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|i think probably the bottom four bits are not any good.|S|Bmr001
me011|regardless yeah.|S|Bmr001
me025|right?|Q|Bmr001
me025|although you know it claims they are.|S|Bmr001
me025|but probably the|D|Bmr001
me011|i was just noticing on the on the there's a view meter software view meter and the p z m gain is real low.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah so i think initially we should take up more space until we've analyzed this and get a better sense of it.|S|Bmr001
me011|so|F|Bmr001
me013|because uh we i mean we're not talking about forty or fifty hours at this point.|S|Bmr001
me025|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|we're talking about a half hour of of speech.|S|Bmr001
me011|yep.|B|Bmr001
me013|and so uh we should look at this carefully.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|but|F|Bmr001
me013|yeah i was interested when i saw the twenty four on there.|S|Bmr001
me025|oh yeah.|S|Bmr001
me013|wow i mean that's probably eight bits of noise.|S|Bmr001
me025|oh yeah.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr001
me013|so|F|Bmr001
me011|yeah that's right.|S|Bmr001
me011|we've got lots of bits of noise.|S|Bmr001
me025|these theories things are pretty amazing.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|and and there's help help they seem they seem good though they seem to be|D|Bmr001
me013|it's some sort of oversampling thing i imagine.|S|Bmr001
me013|right?|Q|Bmr001
me013|didn't we already get that?|Q|Bmr001
me025|oh god knows.|D|Bmr001
me025|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|because you you can't have uh component tolerances that are uh sixteen million one in sixteen million parts.|S|Bmr001
me025|right.|B|Bmr001
me013|so|F|Bmr001
me025|right.|B|Bmr001
me011|right the other other thing another issue is just getting a sound card up here.|S|Bmr001
me011|you know i assumed that we could just put a sound blaster in if we want sound output.|S|Bmr001
me025|that that card that machine's got sound they've got a sound blaster built into it.|S|Bmr001
me011|oh it's just not working.|S|Bmr001
me025|i just i just disabled it because i wanted to find out how well the sound infrastructure would deal with both at once.|S|Bmr001
me011|okay.|S|Bmr001
me025|but i think yeah that's uh probably it will be fine.|S|Bmr001
me011|yeah that way we don't we can't listen to it on this machine.|S|Bmr001
me013|i'm|D|Bmr001
me025|there's no|D|Bmr001
me013|oh!|S|Bmr001
me025|for a couple of reasons.|S|Bmr001
me025|well but the there are two ways we could listen to it.|S|Bmr001
me025|there's a sound there's actually sound output built into this thing.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|but the driver i haven't the driver may not support it yet.|S|Bmr001
me025|and then there's also the sound or the sound card built in.|S|Bmr001
me013|huh.|B|Bmr001
me025|but i don't know how to i don't know how the operating system would like having two sound cards.|S|Bmr001
me013|but we can f t p stuff over.|S|Bmr001
me013|right?|Q|Bmr001
me011|right.|S|Bmr001
me013|so it's connected.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|and we've looked at it so we know it's working.|S|Bmr001
me011|i mean you can see the little squiggles and it looks like speech so|D|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|you just can't listen.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|okay.|B|Bmr001
me013|um|F|Bmr001
me013|one suggestion i have is that um i think this maybe we should just read some more you made more of these.|S|Bmr001
me013|right?|Q|Bmr001
me011|right.|S|Bmr001
me013|i think we should read some more because because this is very|D|Bmr001
me011|okay.|S|Bmr001
me013|we we need to to work the the the uh the talkers more.|S|Bmr001
me013|because we're not going to have that many meetings.|S|Bmr001
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me013|and this is a pretty tiny amount of data.|S|Bmr001
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me013|so maybe we should do another number list and|D|Bmr001
me011|well right i i just did ten per page i could easily do twenty per page.|S|Bmr001
me011|it's just a question of uh of how much uh annoyance i wanted to put uh people going to meetings through.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|well this is us.|S|Bmr001
me013|we'll have a fair amount of annoyance.|S|Bmr001
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|yeah i think.|S|Bmr001
me013|uh|F|Bmr001
me013|so can we do we do another set?|Q|Bmr001
me011|sure.|S|Bmr001
me013|are we are we are we sort of|D|Bmr001
me025|sure.|S|Bmr001
me013|we talked out about what we're|D|Bmr001
me025|well no okay the question i still have about what we're going to do is what is what uh okay so we can get the equipment set up so that basically we're in a situation where we can with you know ten minutes of preparation we can bring nine people in here and do a multi channel recording.|S|Bmr001
me013|okay.|S|Bmr001
me013|right.|B|Bmr001
me025|um|F|Bmr001
me025|what are when are we are we going to do that?|Q|Bmr001
me025|who are they going to be?|Q|Bmr001
me025|what meetings are we going to record?|Q|Bmr001
me011|us to begin with.|S|Bmr001
me025|so which which meetings what meetings do we have?|Q|Bmr001
me011|i think that's the intention.|S|Bmr001
me025|i mean like us being the meeting recorder people or us being anything that speech local does?|Q|Bmr001
me011|well i think i think um certainly us meeting recorder.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|um us other groups.|S|Bmr001
me011|it just depends on how many meetings we're we're having.|S|Bmr001
me011|um.|F|Bmr001
me011|jerry also said it would be he would be willing to have his group some of the a i meetings do it as well.|S|Bmr001
me025|and we should have like we should have decoder meetings and stuff.|S|Bmr001
me011|and uh|F|Bmr001
me011|exactly exactly.|S|Bmr001
me011|i think there are enough incidental meetings for us to to do this.|S|Bmr001
me011|and if we can get it set up so it is convenient enough um then you can just do spontaneous meetings as well.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah i mean that's the thing.|S|Bmr001
me025|it's okay to|D|Bmr001
me025|right.|B|Bmr001
me011|which i'm interested in.|S|Bmr001
me011|i mean that's one of the things the whole reason i want a p d a as opposed to a wired room is for spontaneous meetings.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|right.|B|Bmr001
me025|well we've got to make it really really easy to start it going then in that case.|S|Bmr001
me011|right.|B|Bmr001
me025|because that that's the real goal.|S|Bmr001
me011|that's right.|B|Bmr001
me011|that's why i put ten on here instead of thirty or forty or fifty.|S|Bmr001
me025|right.|B|Bmr001
me025|but i mean if we if we want jerry's group to use it then we probably won't ask them to read any numbers.|S|Bmr001
me025|right?|Q|Bmr001
me011|right.|S|Bmr001
me025|because|D|Bmr001
me011|well i i bet they would be willing to do it the first few times just for the novelty.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|i think they would.|S|Bmr001
me013|and also he's he's he's got at least one woman.|S|Bmr001
me025|that's great.|S|Bmr001
me011|oh that's a good point.|S|Bmr001
me025|i know.|D|Bmr001
me013|and we're we have a little problem of no women.|S|Bmr001
me011|boy that's i had never i hadn't even thought about that.|S|Bmr001
me025|i know it's a disaster.|D|Bmr001
me013|yeah well when when liz uh shriberg starts coming then there's another woman although she|D|Bmr001
me011|oh man!|S|Bmr001
me025|it's all right.|S|Bmr001
me025|she doesn't mind as long as we don't video her.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|right?|Q|Bmr001
me013|uh that's right.|S|Bmr001
me013|that was it.|S|Bmr001
me013|so|F|Bmr001
me011|maybe we should have the reading group here and force jane to come.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr001
me013|no well actually we could have jane uh jane's interested and curious about this stuff so she could attend one of|D|Bmr001
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|probably not the decoder meeting but some of the other stuff she would be interested enough and have her read|D|Bmr001
me025|we could we could have the reading group in here.|S|Bmr001
me011|yeah i mean it's a different style.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|i mean|D|Bmr001
me011|but i think that's all right.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah it's great.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|um we were joking about having lunch up here but eating with the microphones.|S|Bmr001
me011|um i had another question briefly about transcription.|S|Bmr001
me025|okay.|S|Bmr001
me011|so are we going get an external service or are we going to do it?|Q|Bmr001
me011|i mean who's going to generate the transcripts?|Q|Bmr001
me013|um i think that one of the neat things about having this little pilot thing from today is we should try it a couple different ways.|S|Bmr001
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me013|so we should try to do it internally.|S|Bmr001
me013|maybe ask ask jane if we could get her to do it or or or have her supervise a linguistics student or somebody.|S|Bmr001
me025|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me013|and uh see how long it takes and you know multiply out the cost.|S|Bmr001
me013|and then send send the same thing out or maybe split it in halves or something something like that to a to an outside service.|S|Bmr001
me025|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me013|and uh see what that costs and how much hassle that is.|S|Bmr001
me011|right.|B|Bmr001
me013|and then we can assess it.|S|Bmr001
me011|yeah the the problem of course is that it's you know in in this meeting it's three four five six seven eight it's nine transcripts potentially.|S|Bmr001
me025|well except that you wouldn't transcribe them all individually.|S|Bmr001
me013|no.|S|Bmr001
me025|right?|Q|Bmr001
me025|you would send i mean uh a transcriber is used i mean i don't know assume presumably a transcriber transcribes a single meeting.|S|Bmr001
me013|no.|S|Bmr001
me025|right?|Q|Bmr001
me025|and so they they just have to indicate that the speaker changes.|S|Bmr001
me013|right.|S|Bmr001
me013|this was this was the point of having near zero skew.|S|Bmr001
me025|right?|Q|Bmr001
me013|right?|Q|Bmr001
me013|so you just pick one with the best sounding one and give it to somebody and they transcribe it.|S|Bmr001
me011|oh you're right yeah yeah yeah.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|right.|S|Bmr001
me011|so the only thing we'll have to be careful with is that they're|D|Bmr001
me011|well what are they listening to?|Q|Bmr001
me025|so so they they're going to they're going to have to make speaker assignments or something like this.|S|Bmr001
me011|they're going to have to make speaker assignments.|S|Bmr001
me011|and and which recording are they going to listen to?|Q|Bmr001
me025|for one of one of.|S|Bmr001
me025|or we could mix we could mix the the headset mikes you know just to make a single high high quality.|S|Bmr001
me013|right.|B|Bmr001
me025|and we could do and we could do all kinds of weird things like having you know squelch so that you only you know you only you cut it out when there's no energy.|S|Bmr001
me011|oh that would be interesting.|S|Bmr001
me025|so you don't noise.|S|Bmr001
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me013|yeah you could do fancy things but it seems like that's enough.|S|Bmr001
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|i mean there's it's if we if we do something which is have a little bit of human input to get the words then we can leverage that a lot by some clever cross thing to figure out which channel they really belong to and stuff like this probably.|S|Bmr001
me011|okay.|B|Bmr001
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me011|yet|F|Bmr001
me011|so that i mean that's one chunk of work and just segmenting for this is going to be another chunk of work.|S|Bmr001
me011|um|F|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|S|Bmr001
me025|and yeah.|S|Bmr001
me025|as much work as you want.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah but uh i don't know.|S|Bmr001
me013|this meeting so say it's maybe going to be a half hour or something.|S|Bmr001
me013|and and uh we've heard estimates ranging between ten and twenty times uh real time to do this kind of transcription.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|um so you know in in principle then it'll take somebody a day for somebody to deal with this.|S|Bmr001
me025|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me025|wow!|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|and uh we'll see which one of those seems closest to right.|S|Bmr001
me013|and if they ramped up if towards the end it was faster you know get some sort of sense from them uh from whoever does it.|S|Bmr001
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me013|and um then uh like i say check it out with an external service and see if it's faster cheaper better worse whatever.|S|Bmr001
me011|right.|B|Bmr001
me013|then we'll go from there.|S|Bmr001
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me011|yeah one of the things i was thinking with transcript is that if we take the near field and we do an initial recognition pass is it easier for a transcriber to correct a transcript if the near field mike does a reasonably good job?|Q|Bmr001
me025|huh.|B|Bmr001
me011|i bet it isn't unless it's really close to right.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me025|i have just because it's such an|D|Bmr001
me025|the transcribing is sort of something i can imagine doing whereas having this distraction of having sort of something that looks like it might be right but has got some very wrong bits in is sort of a less less easy thing to do.|S|Bmr001
me011|right.|B|Bmr001
me011|some errors yeah.|S|Bmr001
me013|i don't know.|S|Bmr001
me013|i i don't know the answer to that.|S|Bmr001
me025|i'm sure the professional transcribers obviously don't have any use for|D|Bmr001
me013|i don't know.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah yeah that's true.|S|Bmr001
me013|well i mean there's this cyber transcriber service.|S|Bmr001
me013|right?|Q|Bmr001
me025|that's true.|S|Bmr001
me013|and at least supposedly the way they work is by feeding them what is the output of the recognizer.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah by fixing up transcripts.|S|Bmr001
me013|so maybe it depends on what the software tools are like.|S|Bmr001
me025|yeah but yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|if it's you know if they can easily flip through stuff and get to the right thing|D|Bmr001
me013|or do you point?|Q|Bmr001
me013|or i don't know.|S|Bmr001
me013|there's supposed to be some out out out of work shepherders or something in scotland but|D|Bmr001
me025|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|uh the internet.|S|Bmr001
me025|they should all be in india right now.|S|Bmr001
me025|that's where the good but the cheap english speakers are.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me011|not in scotland.|S|Bmr001
me013|inexpensive.|S|Bmr001
me025|i'm sorry yeah.|S|Bmr001
me011|not in scotland.|S|Bmr001
me025|well they don't speak such clear english.|S|Bmr001
me011|they they sheep they they they speak cheap english.|S|Bmr001
me011|right?|Q|Bmr001
me013|okay so we're degenerating.|S|Bmr001
me013|right?|Q|Bmr001
me013|are are are we done with uh m r business?|Q|Bmr001
me025|yep.|S|Bmr001
me011|sure.|S|Bmr001
me013|or|D|Bmr001
me013|i mean what what's maybe we should what are our action items?|Q|Bmr001
me013|so there's there's the continuing process of cleaning up the stuff and making it easier to do that.|S|Bmr001
me013|there's taking the results of this meeting and putting it in some kind of decent form.|S|Bmr001
me013|probably getting some kind of single channel merged sum data or something so that you can give a simple sound file of some sort to a transcriber to deal with it rather than this massive thing.|S|Bmr001
me025|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me025|uhhuh.|B|Bmr001
me013|that's a little bit of stuff to do.|S|Bmr001
me011|right.|S|Bmr001
me013|right?|Q|Bmr001
me011|and then do some segmenting and recognition initial recognition would be interesting to do.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah although it it it it may be separating out these numbers from the rest.|S|Bmr001
me011|that's what i mean.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr001
me013|and then|D|Bmr001
me011|yeah just doing a digits on it uh connected digits.|S|Bmr001
me013|yeah and uh|F|Bmr001
me013|right.|B|Bmr001
me013|so with this next|D|Bmr001
me011|you want to read?|Q|Bmr001
me013|sure.|S|Bmr001
me013|okay.|F|Bmr001
me013|how many more you got?|Q|Bmr001
me011|oh i i did ten but i can i have a script to generate them automatically.|S|Bmr001
me013|well let's do some more while we got them here.|S|Bmr001
me025|wow!|S|Bmr001
me011|okay.|S|Bmr001
me025|what fun it is.|S|Bmr001
me013|well you know it's not but|D|Bmr001
me025|it's interesting that um it it's not clear whether it's better to have them written as as words or or figures.|S|Bmr001
me025|but of course to get zero and o s distinguished we you have to do it.|S|Bmr001
me011|that's why.|S|Bmr001
me011|yep.|B|Bmr001
me025|but it's kind of weird to read.|S|Bmr001
