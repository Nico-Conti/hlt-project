me013|does anybody have an agenda?|Q|Bmr010
me011|no.|S|Bmr010
fe008|well i'm i sent a couple of items they're they're sort of practical.|S|Bmr010
me013|i thought somebody had.|S|Bmr010
fe008|i don't know if you're|D|Bmr010
me013|yeah that's right.|S|Bmr010
fe008|if if that's too practical for what we're focused on.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah we only want useless things.|S|Bmr010
me011|i mean we don't want anything too practical.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr010
me011|yeah that would be|D|Bmr010
me013|no why don't we talk about practical things?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr010
me013|sure.|S|Bmr010
fe008|well um i can give you an update on the transcription effort.|S|Bmr010
me013|great.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uh maybe raise the issue of microphone uh um procedures.|S|Bmr010
fe008|with reference to the cleanliness of the recordings.|S|Bmr010
me013|okay transcription uh microphone issues|D|Bmr010
fe008|and then maybe ask uh these guys.|S|Bmr010
fe008|the we have great great uh steps forward in terms of the nonspeech speech pre-segmenting of the signal.|S|Bmr010
me013|okay.|S|Bmr010
me011|well we have steps forward.|S|Bmr010
fe008|well it's a it's a big improvement.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me013|yes.|S|Bmr010
mn014|i would prefer this.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah well|D|Bmr010
me013|okay.|S|Bmr010
me013|uh|F|Bmr010
mn005|we talk about the the results of|D|Bmr010
me013|you have some|D|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me013|okay.|S|Bmr010
me011|i have a little bit of i ram stuff.|S|Bmr010
mn005|use|D|Bmr010
me011|but i'm not sure if that's of general interest or not.|S|Bmr010
me013|uh bigram?|Q|Bmr010
me011|i ram.|S|Bmr010
me013|i ram.|S|Bmr010
mn005|i ram.|S|Bmr010
me013|well maybe.|S|Bmr010
me011|i ram bigram.|S|Bmr010
mn005|bigram.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah let's let's see where we are at three thirty.|S|Bmr010
me011|you know.|D|Bmr010
mn017|huh.|D|Bmr010
me013|um|F|Bmr010
mn017|since uh since i have to leave as usual at three thirty can we do the interesting stuff first?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|i beg your pardon.|S|Bmr010
me013|well|F|Bmr010
mn014|which is|D|Bmr010
fe008|i beg your pardon.|S|Bmr010
me011|what's the interesting stuff?|Q|Bmr010
me013|yeah now you get to tell us what's the interesting part.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me018|please specify.|S|Bmr010
me013|but|F|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn017|well uh i guess the work that's been done on segmentation would be most.|S|Bmr010
fe008|i think that would be a good thing to start with.|S|Bmr010
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me013|okay.|S|Bmr010
me013|um and um the other thing uh|D|Bmr010
me013|which i'll just say very briefly that maybe relates to that a little bit|D|Bmr010
me013|which is that um|D|Bmr010
me013|uh one of the suggestions that came up in a brief meeting i had the other day when i was in spain.|S|Bmr010
me013|with uh manolo pardo and javier uh ferreiros who was here before.|S|Bmr010
me013|was um why not start with what they had before but add in the non silence boundaries.|S|Bmr010
me013|so in what javier did before when they were doing um|D|Bmr010
me013|he was looking for uh speaker change points.|S|Bmr010
mn005|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|um|F|Bmr010
me013|as a simplification he originally did this only using silence as uh a putative uh speaker change point.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|and uh he did not say look at points where you were changing broad uh phonetic class for instance.|S|Bmr010
me013|and for broadcast news that was fine.|S|Bmr010
me013|here obviously it's not.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|and um so one of the things that they were pushing in in discussing with me is um|D|Bmr010
me013|why are you spending so much time uh on the uh feature issue.|S|Bmr010
me013|uh when perhaps if you sort of deal with what you were using before.|S|Bmr010
mn005|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|and then just broadened it a bit instead of just using silence as putative change point also.|S|Bmr010
me013|so then you've got you already have the super structure with gaussians and h you know simple h m ms and so forth.|S|Bmr010
mn005|nnn yeah.|D|Bmr010
me013|and you you might|D|Bmr010
me013|so there was a there was a little bit of a a a a difference of opinion.|S|Bmr010
me013|because i i thought that it was it's interesting to look at what features are useful.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|D|Bmr010
me013|but uh on the other hand i saw that the they had a good point.|S|Bmr010
me013|that uh if we had something that worked for many cases before maybe starting from there a little bit.|S|Bmr010
me013|because ultimately we're going to end up with some kind of structure like that.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|D|Bmr010
me013|where you have some kind of simple h m m.|S|Bmr010
me013|and you're testing the hypothesis that uh there is a change.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|so|F|Bmr010
me013|so anyway i just reporting that.|S|Bmr010
me013|but uh uh|F|Bmr010
mn005|okay.|S|Bmr010
me013|so yeah why don't we do the speech nonspeech discussion?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr010
fe008|do i i hear you you didn't|D|Bmr010
mn014|speech nonspeech?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Bmr010
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr010
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn014|um so uh what we basically did so far was using the mixed file to to detect speech or nonspeech portions in that.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn014|and what i did so far is i just used our old munich system.|S|Bmr010
mn014|which is an h m based system with gaussian mixtures for speech and nonspeech.|S|Bmr010
mn014|and it was a system which used only one gaussian for silence and one gaussian for speech.|S|Bmr010
mn014|and now i added uh multi mixture possibility for for speech and nonspeech.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn014|and i did some training on on one dialogue which was transcribed by|D|Bmr010
mn014|yeah we we did a speech nonspeech transcription.|S|Bmr010
mn005|jose.|S|Bmr010
mn014|adam dave and i we did.|S|Bmr010
mn014|for that dialogue.|S|Bmr010
mn014|and i trained it on that.|S|Bmr010
mn014|and i did some pre-segmentations for for jane.|S|Bmr010
mn014|and i'm not sure how good they are or what what the transcribers say.|S|Bmr010
mn014|they they can use it?|Q|Bmr010
mn014|or|D|Bmr010
fe008|uh they they think it's a terrific improvement.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and um it it just makes a a world of difference.|S|Bmr010
me013|huh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|and um you also did some something in addition.|S|Bmr010
fe008|which was um for those in which there was uh quiet speakers in the mix.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn014|uh yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn014|that that was one one one thing.|S|Bmr010
mn014|uh why i added more mixtures for for the speech.|S|Bmr010
mn014|so i saw that there were loud loudly speaking speakers and quietly speaking speakers.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn014|and so i did two mixtures one for the loud speakers and one for the quiet speakers.|S|Bmr010
me011|and did you hand label who was loud and who was quiet?|Q|Bmr010
mn014|i did that for for five minutes of one dialogue.|S|Bmr010
me011|or did you just|D|Bmr010
me011|right.|S|Bmr010
mn014|and that was enough to to train the system.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn017|what|D|Bmr010
mn014|and so it it adapts uh on while running.|S|Bmr010
mn014|so|F|Bmr010
mn017|what kind of uh front end processing did you do?|Q|Bmr010
mn014|hopefully.|S|Bmr010
mn005|okay.|B|Bmr010
mn014|it's just our our old munich uh loudness based spectrum.|S|Bmr010
mn014|on mel scale twenty twenty critical bands and then loudness.|S|Bmr010
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn014|and four additional features which is energy loudness modified loudness and zero crossing rate.|S|Bmr010
mn014|so it's twenty four twenty four features.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|and you also provided me with several different versions.|S|Bmr010
fe008|which i compared.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|F|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|F|Bmr010
fe008|and so you change parameters.|S|Bmr010
fe008|what|D|Bmr010
fe008|do you want to say something about the parameters that you change?|Q|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|F|Bmr010
mn014|you can specify the minimum length of speech or and silence portions which you want.|S|Bmr010
mn014|and so i did some some modifications in those parameters.|S|Bmr010
mn014|basically changing the minimum minimum length for for silence.|S|Bmr010
mn014|to have|D|Bmr010
mn014|to have um|D|Bmr010
mn014|yeah|F|Bmr010
mn014|to have more or less uh silence portions inserted.|S|Bmr010
mn014|so|F|Bmr010
me011|right so this would work well for uh pauses and utterance boundaries and things like that.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|D|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me011|but for overlap i imagine that doesn't work at all.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me011|that you'll have plenty of sections that are|D|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|D|Bmr010
mn014|that's it.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|D|Bmr010
fe008|that's true.|S|Bmr010
me013|um|F|Bmr010
fe008|but it it saves so much time the the transcribers.|S|Bmr010
me011|but|F|Bmr010
me011|yep.|S|Bmr010
fe008|just enormous enormous savings.|S|Bmr010
me013|that's great.|S|Bmr010
fe008|fantastic.|F|Bmr010
me013|um just one quickly uh still on the features.|S|Bmr010
me013|so you have these twenty four features.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|uh a lot of them are spectral features.|S|Bmr010
me013|is there a a transformation uh like principal components transformation or something?|Q|Bmr010
mn014|no.|S|Bmr010
mn014|no we originally we did that.|S|Bmr010
me011|yeah it was i s two.|S|Bmr010
me013|just|D|Bmr010
mn014|but we saw uh|D|Bmr010
mn014|when we used it uh for our close talking microphone which|D|Bmr010
mn014|yeah for our for our recognizer in munich|D|Bmr010
mn014|we saw that it's it's not it's not so necessary.|S|Bmr010
mn014|it it works as well with with without uh a l d a or something.|S|Bmr010
me013|okay.|S|Bmr010
me013|okay no i was curious.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|yeah i don't think it's a big deal for this application.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|D|Bmr010
me013|but but yeah it's a|D|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn005|right.|D|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|D|Bmr010
fe008|okay but then there's another thing that also thilo's involved with|D|Bmr010
fe008|which is um|D|Bmr010
fe008|okay and and also dave gelbart.|S|Bmr010
fe008|so there's this this problem of|D|Bmr010
fe008|and and so we had this meeting.|S|Bmr010
fe008|the also adam before the the before you went away.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uh we um regarding the representation of overlaps.|S|Bmr010
fe008|because at present um because of the limitations of the interface we're using.|S|Bmr010
fe008|overlaps are uh not being encoded by the transcribers in as complete and uh detailed a way as it might be.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and as might be desired i think would be desired in the corpus ultimately.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|so we don't have start and end points at each point where there's an overlap.|S|Bmr010
fe008|we just have the the overlaps encoded in a simple bin.|S|Bmr010
fe008|well okay so the limits of the of of the interface are such that we were at this meeting we were entertaining how we might either expand the the interface or find other tools which already do what would be useful.|S|Bmr010
fe008|because what would ultimately be um ideal in my my view|D|Bmr010
fe008|and i think i mean i had the sense that it was consensus|D|Bmr010
fe008|is that um a thorough going musical score notation would be the best way to go.|S|Bmr010
fe008|because you can have multiple channels.|S|Bmr010
fe008|there's a single timeline.|S|Bmr010
fe008|it's very clear flexible and all those nice things.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|okay so um|F|Bmr010
fe008|um i spoke i had a meeting with dave gelbart on on and he had uh excellent ideas on how the interface could be modified to to do this kind of representation.|S|Bmr010
fe008|but um he in the meantime you were checking into the existence of already um existing interfaces which might already have these properties.|S|Bmr010
fe008|so do you want to say something about that?|Q|Bmr010
mn014|yes.|S|Bmr010
mn014|um i talked with uh munich guys from from ludwig maximilians university who do a lot of transcribing and transliterations.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn014|and they basically said they have they have uh a tool they developed themselves.|S|Bmr010
mn014|and they can't give away uh it's too error prone.|S|Bmr010
mn014|and had it's not supported.|S|Bmr010
mn014|and|D|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn014|but um|F|Bmr010
mn014|susanne burger who is at c m u he who was formally at in munich and and is now at with c m u.|S|Bmr010
mn014|she said she has something.|S|Bmr010
mn014|which she uses to do eight channels uh transliterations.|S|Bmr010
mn014|eight channels simultaneously.|S|Bmr010
me013|excuse me.|D|Bmr010
mn014|but it's running under windows.|S|Bmr010
fe008|under windows.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Bmr010
mn014|so i'm not sure if if if we can use it.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn014|she said she would give it to us.|S|Bmr010
mn014|it wouldn't be a problem.|S|Bmr010
mn014|and i've got some some kind of manual down in my office.|S|Bmr010
me011|well maybe we should get it.|S|Bmr010
me011|and if it's good enough we'll arrange windows machines to be available.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh we could uh potentially so.|S|Bmr010
me011|so|F|Bmr010
fe008|i also wanted to be sure|D|Bmr010
fe008|i mean i've i've seen the|D|Bmr010
fe008|this this is called praat p r a a t which i guess means speech in dutch or something.|S|Bmr010
me011|yep.|B|Bmr010
mn014|yeah but then i'm not sure that's the right thing for us.|S|Bmr010
fe008|but|D|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|in terms of it being windows versus|D|Bmr010
fe008|but i'm just wondering is|D|Bmr010
me011|no no praat isn't praat's multi platform.|S|Bmr010
mn014|no no praat|D|Bmr010
mn014|yeah yeah.|S|Bmr010
fe008|oh i see.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|oh i see.|S|Bmr010
fe008|so praat may not be|D|Bmr010
mn014|that's not praat.|S|Bmr010
mn014|it's called transedit i think.|S|Bmr010
fe008|it's a different one.|S|Bmr010
fe008|i see.|S|Bmr010
mn014|the the uh the tool from from susanne.|S|Bmr010
fe008|oh i see.|S|Bmr010
fe008|okay okay all right.|S|Bmr010
me013|the other thing uh to keep in mind|D|Bmr010
me013|uh i mean|D|Bmr010
me013|we've been very concerned to get all this rolling.|S|Bmr010
me013|so that we would actually have data.|S|Bmr010
fe008|huh yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|but um i think our outside sponsor is actually going to kick in.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|and ultimately that path will be smoothed out.|S|Bmr010
me013|so i don't know if we have a long-term need to do lots and lots of transcribing.|S|Bmr010
me013|i think we had a very quick need to get something out.|S|Bmr010
me013|and we'd like to be able to do some later.|S|Bmr010
me013|because just it's it's interesting.|S|Bmr010
me013|but as far you know uh with with any luck we'll be able to wind down the larger project.|S|Bmr010
me011|oh.|F|Bmr010
mn017|but you|D|Bmr010
me011|what our decision was is that we'll go ahead with what we have with a not very fine time scale on the overlaps.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|right.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me011|and and do what we can later to clean that up if we need to.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|right.|B|Bmr010
fe008|and and i was just thinking that um if it were possible to bring that in like you know this week|D|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|then when they're encoding the overlaps it would be nice for them to be able to specify when you know the start points and end points of overlaps.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|uh they're making really quick progress.|S|Bmr010
me013|that's great.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and um so my my goal was my charge was to get eleven hours by the end of the month.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and it'll be i'm i'm i'm clear that we'll be able to do that.|S|Bmr010
me013|that's great.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me011|and did you uh forward morgan brian's thing?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|i sent it to|D|Bmr010
fe008|um|F|Bmr010
fe008|who did i send that to?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|i sent it to a list.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and i thought i sent it to the to the local list.|S|Bmr010
me018|meeting recorder.|S|Bmr010
me011|oh you did?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|you saw that?|Q|Bmr010
me011|okay so you probably did get that.|S|Bmr010
fe008|so brian did tell me that in fact what you said that uh that our|D|Bmr010
fe008|that they are making progress.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and that he's going that they're going he's going to check the the output of the first transcription.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and|D|Bmr010
me013|i mean basically it's it's all the difference in the world.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and|F|Bmr010
me013|i mean basically he's he's on it now.|S|Bmr010
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|oh that's|D|Bmr010
me013|so so so this is so it'll happen.|S|Bmr010
fe008|this is a new development.|S|Bmr010
fe008|okay.|B|Bmr010
fe008|super.|S|Bmr010
fe008|super.|S|Bmr010
fe008|okay great.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah i mean basically it's just saying that one of our one of our best people is on it.|S|Bmr010
me013|you know who just doesn't happen to be here anymore.|S|Bmr010
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|someone else pays him.|S|Bmr010
me013|so|F|Bmr010
fe008|isn't that great?|Q|Bmr010
mn017|but about the need for transcription.|S|Bmr010
mn017|i mean don't we didn't we previously decide that the i b m transcripts would have to be checked anyway and possibly augmented?|Q|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|yes that's true.|S|Bmr010
mn017|so i think having a good tool is worth something no matter what.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me013|okay that's that's a good point.|S|Bmr010
me011|yeah and dave gelbart did volunteer.|S|Bmr010
fe008|good.|B|Bmr010
me011|and since he's not here i'll repeat it.|S|Bmr010
me011|to at least modify transcriber.|S|Bmr010
me011|which if we don't have something else that works i think that's a pretty good way of going.|S|Bmr010
mn014|huh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me011|and we discussed on some methods to do it.|S|Bmr010
me011|my approach originally|D|Bmr010
me011|and i've already hacked on it a little bit|D|Bmr010
me011|it was too slow because i was trying to display all the waveforms.|S|Bmr010
me011|but he pointed out that you don't really have to.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me011|i think that's a good point.|S|Bmr010
me013|huh.|B|Bmr010
me011|that if you just display the mix waveform and then have a user interface for editing the different channels that's perfectly sufficient.|S|Bmr010
fe008|yeah exactly.|F|Bmr010
fe008|and just keep those things separate.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and and um dan ellis's hack already allows them to be able to display different waveforms to clarify overlaps and things.|S|Bmr010
fe008|so that's already|D|Bmr010
me011|no they can only display one.|S|Bmr010
me011|but they can listen to different ones.|S|Bmr010
fe008|oh yes but|D|Bmr010
fe008|well uh yes but what i mean is that uh from the transcriber's perspective uh those two functions are separate.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and dan ellis's hack handles the um choice the ability to choose different wave forms from moment to moment.|S|Bmr010
me011|but only to listen to.|S|Bmr010
me011|not to look at.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|um|F|Bmr010
me011|the waveform you're looking at doesn't change.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|that's true.|S|Bmr010
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|but that's that's okay.|S|Bmr010
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|because they're they're|D|Bmr010
fe008|you know they're focused on the ear anyway.|S|Bmr010
me011|right.|B|Bmr010
me013|huh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|and then and then|D|Bmr010
fe008|the hack to preserve the overlaps better would be one which creates different output files for each channel.|S|Bmr010
fe008|which then would also serve liz's request of having.|S|Bmr010
me011|right.|B|Bmr010
fe008|you know a single channel.|S|Bmr010
fe008|separable uh cleanly easily separable.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|D|Bmr010
fe008|uh transcript tied to a single channel uh audio.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|have uh folks from nist been in contact with you?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|not directly.|S|Bmr010
fe008|i'm trying to think if if i could have gotten it over a list.|S|Bmr010
me013|okay.|S|Bmr010
fe008|i don't i don't think so.|S|Bmr010
me013|okay well holidays may have interrupted things.|S|Bmr010
me013|because in in in|D|Bmr010
me013|they seem to want to get absolutely clear on standards for transcription standards and so forth with with us.|S|Bmr010
fe008|oh this was from before december.|S|Bmr010
me013|right because they're they're presumably going to start recording next month.|S|Bmr010
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|okay okay.|S|Bmr010
me013|so|F|Bmr010
me011|oh we should definitely get with them then.|S|Bmr010
me011|and|F|Bmr010
me011|agree upon a format.|S|Bmr010
me011|though i don't remember email on that.|S|Bmr010
me011|so was i not in the loop on that?|Q|Bmr010
me013|um yeah i don't think i mailed anybody.|S|Bmr010
me013|i just think i told them to contact jane that uh if they had a|D|Bmr010
me011|oh okay.|S|Bmr010
fe008|that's right.|S|Bmr010
me013|if uh that that uh as the point person on it.|S|Bmr010
me013|but|F|Bmr010
me011|yeah i think that's right.|S|Bmr010
me011|just uh|F|Bmr010
me013|so yeah maybe i'll uh ping them a little bit about it to get that straight.|S|Bmr010
fe008|okay.|F|Bmr010
fe008|i'm keeping the conventions absolutely as simple as possible.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah so is it because with any luck there'll actually be a a there'll be collections at columbia.|S|Bmr010
me013|collections at at u w.|S|Bmr010
me013|i mean dan dan is very interested in doing some other things.|S|Bmr010
me011|right.|B|Bmr010
fe008|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr010
me011|well i think it's important both for the notation and the machine representation to be the same.|S|Bmr010
me013|and collections at nist.|S|Bmr010
me013|so|F|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me011|so|F|Bmr010
fe008|there was also this uh email from dan regarding the speech non nonspeech segmentation thing.|S|Bmr010
me011|yep.|B|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|i don't know if|D|Bmr010
fe008|uh|F|Bmr010
fe008|uh we want to|D|Bmr010
fe008|uh|F|Bmr010
fe008|and dan and dave gelbart is interested in pursuing the aspect of using amplitude as a a a as a basis for the separation.|S|Bmr010
me013|oh yeah he was talking he was talking i mean uh we he had|D|Bmr010
me011|cross correlation.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah cross correlation.|S|Bmr010
me013|i had mentioned this a couple times before the the commercial devices that do uh uh voice uh you know active miking.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|basically look at the at the energy at each of the mikes.|S|Bmr010
me013|and and you basically compare the energy here to some function of all of the mikes.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|so|F|Bmr010
fe008|okay.|B|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|by doing that you know rather than setting any uh absolute threshold you actually can do pretty good uh selection of who who's talking.|S|Bmr010
fe008|okay.|B|Bmr010
me013|uh|F|Bmr010
me013|and those those systems work very well by the way.|S|Bmr010
me013|i mean so people use them in panel discussions and so forth with sound reinforcement differing in in sort of|D|Bmr010
mn005|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|uh|F|Bmr010
me013|and uh those if|D|Bmr010
me013|boy the guy i knew who built them built them like twenty twenty years ago.|S|Bmr010
me013|so they're it's the the techniques work pretty well.|S|Bmr010
me011|huh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|fantastic.|F|Bmr010
me013|so|F|Bmr010
fe008|because there is one thing that we don't have right now and that is the automatic um channel identifier.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|that that you know that would help in terms of encoding of overlaps.|S|Bmr010
fe008|the the transcribers would have less uh disentangling to do if that were available.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah so i think you know basically you can look at some you have to play around a little bit uh to figure out what the right statistic is.|S|Bmr010
fe008|but|F|Bmr010
mn005|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|but you compare each microphone to some statistic based on the on the overall.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn005|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr010
me013|uh and we also have these we have the advantage of having distant mikes too.|S|Bmr010
me013|so that you|D|Bmr010
me011|yeah although the the|D|Bmr010
me011|using the close talking i think would be much better.|S|Bmr010
me011|wouldn't it?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|yeah.|D|Bmr010
me013|um i i don't know.|S|Bmr010
me013|i just it'd be|D|Bmr010
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|if i was actually working on it i'd sit there and and play around with it.|S|Bmr010
me013|and and get a feeling for it.|S|Bmr010
me013|i mean the the the|D|Bmr010
me013|uh|F|Bmr010
me013|but|F|Bmr010
me013|uh you certainly want to use the close talking as a at least.|S|Bmr010
me011|right.|B|Bmr010
me013|i don't know if the other would would add some other helpful dimension or not.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn005|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn005|okay what what are the different uh classes to to code uh the the overlap you will use?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|um to code|D|Bmr010
fe008|so types of overlap?|Q|Bmr010
mn005|what you you|D|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|S|Bmr010
fe008|um so at a meeting that wasn't transcribed we worked up a a typology.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|and um|D|Bmr010
mn005|look like uh you you explaining in the blackboard?|Q|Bmr010
mn005|the|D|Bmr010
fe008|yes exactly.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|that hasn't changed.|S|Bmr010
fe008|so|F|Bmr010
fe008|it the it's basically a two tiered structure where the first one is whether the person who's interrupted continues or not.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and then below that there're subcategories uh that have more to do with you know is it uh simply backchannel.|S|Bmr010
mn005|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|or is it um someone completing someone else's thought.|S|Bmr010
fe008|or is it someone introducing a new thought.|S|Bmr010
me011|right.|F|Bmr010
me011|and i hope that if we do a forced alignment with the close talking mike that will be enough to recover at least some of the time the time information of when the overlap occurred.|S|Bmr010
mn005|huh.|B|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh well one would|D|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn005|we hope.|S|Bmr010
me011|yeah who knows?|S|Bmr010
fe008|that'd be that'd be nice.|S|Bmr010
fe008|i mean i i i i've|D|Bmr010
mn017|so who's going to do that?|Q|Bmr010
mn017|who's going to do forced alignment?|Q|Bmr010
me011|well uh i b m was going to.|S|Bmr010
me011|um|F|Bmr010
mn017|oh okay.|S|Bmr010
mn005|oh.|S|Bmr010
me011|and i imagine they still plan to.|S|Bmr010
me011|but but you know i haven't spoken with them about that recently.|S|Bmr010
mn017|okay.|B|Bmr010
mn005|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|well uh my suggestion now is is on all of these things to uh contact brian.|S|Bmr010
me011|okay i'll do that.|S|Bmr010
fe008|this is wonderful to have a direct contact like that.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|D|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|uh well let me ask you this.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|it occurs to me one of my transcribers told me today that she'll be finished with one meeting um by|D|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|well she said tomorrow.|S|Bmr010
fe008|but then she said you know|D|Bmr010
fe008|but the you know let's let's just uh say|D|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|maybe the day after just to be on the safe side.|S|Bmr010
fe008|i could send brian the um the transcript.|S|Bmr010
fe008|i know these are|D|Bmr010
fe008|uh uh i could send him that if it would be possible or a good idea or not to try to do a forced alignment on what we're on the way we're encoding overlaps now.|S|Bmr010
me013|well just talk to him about it.|S|Bmr010
me011|yep.|B|Bmr010
fe008|good.|S|Bmr010
me013|i mean you know basically he's he just studies he's a colleague.|S|Bmr010
me013|a friend.|S|Bmr010
me013|and|F|Bmr010
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|uh they and and you know the the organization always did want to help us.|S|Bmr010
fe008|super super.|B|Bmr010
me013|it was just a question of getting you know the right people connected in who had the time.|S|Bmr010
fe008|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr010
me011|right.|B|Bmr010
me013|so|F|Bmr010
me013|um uh|F|Bmr010
me011|is he on the mailing list?|Q|Bmr010
me011|the meeting recorder mailing|D|Bmr010
fe008|oh!|S|Bmr010
me011|we should add him.|S|Bmr010
fe008|yeah i i i don't know for sure.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me018|did something happen morgan that he got put on this or was he already on it?|Q|Bmr010
me011|add him.|S|Bmr010
me018|or|D|Bmr010
me013|no i uh uh|D|Bmr010
me013|it it i it's|D|Bmr010
me013|yeah something happened.|S|Bmr010
me013|i don't know what.|S|Bmr010
mn017|he asked for more work.|S|Bmr010
me018|huh.|B|Bmr010
me013|but he's on it now.|S|Bmr010
fe008|that would be like that'd be like him.|S|Bmr010
fe008|he's great.|S|Bmr010
me013|right.|B|Bmr010
me013|so uh|F|Bmr010
me013|where are we?|Q|Bmr010
me013|maybe uh uh brief|D|Bmr010
me013|well let's why don't we talk about microphone issues?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|yeah that'd be great.|S|Bmr010
me013|that was that was a|D|Bmr010
me011|um|F|Bmr010
me011|so one thing is that i did look on sony's for a replacement for the mikes for the head head worn ones.|S|Bmr010
me011|because they're so uncomfortable.|S|Bmr010
me011|but i think i need someone who knows more about mikes than i do.|S|Bmr010
me011|because i couldn't find a single other model that seemed like it would fit the connector.|S|Bmr010
me011|which seems really unlikely to me.|S|Bmr010
me011|does anyone like know stores?|Q|Bmr010
me011|or know about mikes who who would know the right questions to ask?|Q|Bmr010
me013|oh i probably would.|S|Bmr010
me013|i mean my knowledge is twenty years out of date.|S|Bmr010
me013|but some of it's still the same.|S|Bmr010
me013|so|F|Bmr010
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|uh so maybe we we can take a look at that.|S|Bmr010
me018|you couldn't you couldn't find the right connector to go into these things?|Q|Bmr010
me011|yep.|S|Bmr010
me018|huh.|S|Bmr010
me011|when i looked they listed one microphone and that's it.|S|Bmr010
me011|as having that type of connector.|S|Bmr010
me011|but my guess is that sony maybe uses a different number for their connector than everyone else does.|S|Bmr010
me011|and and so|F|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|well let's look at it together.|S|Bmr010
me011|it seems it seems really unlikely to me that there's only one.|S|Bmr010
me013|and|F|Bmr010
fe008|and there's no adaptor for it?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|seems like there'd be a|D|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|okay.|B|Bmr010
me011|as i said who knows.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|who who are we buying these from?|Q|Bmr010
me011|um|F|Bmr010
me013|that'd be|D|Bmr010
me011|i have it downstairs.|S|Bmr010
me011|i don't remember off the top of my head.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me013|okay.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah we we can try and look at that together.|S|Bmr010
me011|and then uh|F|Bmr010
me011|just in terms of how you wear them|D|Bmr010
me011|i mean i had thought about this before.|S|Bmr010
me011|i mean when when when you use a product like dragon dictate they have a very extensive description about how to wear the microphone and so on.|S|Bmr010
fe008|oh.|D|Bmr010
me011|but i felt that in a real situation we were very seldom going to get people to really do it.|S|Bmr010
me011|and maybe it wasn't worth concentrating on.|S|Bmr010
me011|but|F|Bmr010
me013|well i think that that's that's a good back off position.|S|Bmr010
me013|that's what i was saying earlier.|S|Bmr010
me013|that you know we are going to get some recordings that are imperfect.|S|Bmr010
me013|and hey that's life.|S|Bmr010
me013|but i i think that it it doesn't hurt uh the naturalness of the situation to try to have people wear the microphones properly if possible.|S|Bmr010
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|because um the natural situation is really what we have with the microphones on the table.|S|Bmr010
me013|i mean i think you know in the target applications that we're talking about people aren't going to be wearing head mounted mikes anyway.|S|Bmr010
me011|oh that's true.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|so this is just for these head mounted mikes are just for use with research.|S|Bmr010
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|and uh it's going to make|D|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|you know if if andreas plays around with language modeling he's not going to be want to be messed up by people breathing into the microphone.|S|Bmr010
me011|right.|S|Bmr010
me013|so it's it's uh uh|D|Bmr010
me011|well i'll dig through the documentation to dragon dictate and see if they still have the little form.|S|Bmr010
me013|but it does happen.|S|Bmr010
me013|right?|Q|Bmr010
me013|i mean and any|D|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn017|it's interesting.|S|Bmr010
mn017|uh|F|Bmr010
mn017|i talked to some i b m guys uh last january i think i was there.|S|Bmr010
mn017|and|F|Bmr010
mn017|so people who were working on the on their viavoice dictation product.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn017|and they said uh the breathing is really a a terrible problem for them.|S|Bmr010
mn017|to to not recognize breathing as speech.|S|Bmr010
fe008|wow.|B|Bmr010
mn017|so anything to reduce breathing is is is a good thing.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me011|well that's the|D|Bmr010
me011|it seemed to me when i was using dragon that it was really microphone placement helped an in uh an enormous amount.|S|Bmr010
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me011|so you want it enough to the side so that when you exhale through your nose it doesn't the wind doesn't hit the mike.|S|Bmr010
mn017|right.|B|Bmr010
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me011|and then uh|F|Bmr010
me011|everyone's adjusting their microphones of course.|S|Bmr010
me011|and then just close enough so that you get good volume.|S|Bmr010
me011|so you know wearing it right about here seems to be about the right way to do it.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|D|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|i remember when i was when i i i i used uh um a prominent laboratory's uh uh speech recognizer.|S|Bmr010
fe008|is|D|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|about uh this was boy this was a while ago.|S|Bmr010
me013|this was about twelve twelve years ago or something.|S|Bmr010
me013|and um|F|Bmr010
me013|they were they were perturbed with me.|S|Bmr010
me013|because i was breathing in instead of breathing out.|S|Bmr010
me013|and they had models for they they had markov models for breathing out.|S|Bmr010
me013|but they didn't have them for breathing in.|S|Bmr010
me013|uh|F|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|that's interesting.|B|Bmr010
fe008|well what i wondered is whether it's possible to have to maybe use the display at the beginning.|S|Bmr010
fe008|to be able to to judge how how correctly|D|Bmr010
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|i mean have someone do some routine whatever.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and and then see if when they're breathing it's showing.|S|Bmr010
fe008|i don't know if the if it's|D|Bmr010
me011|i mean when when it's on you can see it.|S|Bmr010
me013|i|D|Bmr010
me011|you can definitely see it.|S|Bmr010
fe008|can you see the breathing?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|because i|D|Bmr010
me011|absolutely.|S|Bmr010
fe008|oh.|S|Bmr010
me011|absolutely.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me011|and so you know i've i've sat here and watched sometimes the breathing.|S|Bmr010
me011|and the bar going up and down.|S|Bmr010
me011|and i'm thinking i could say something.|S|Bmr010
me011|but|F|Bmr010
me013|i mean i think|D|Bmr010
me011|i don't want to make people self conscious.|S|Bmr010
me011|stop breathing.|S|Bmr010
me013|it it's going to be imperfect.|S|Bmr010
me013|you're not going to get it perfect.|S|Bmr010
fe008|yeah uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|and you can do some uh you know first order thing about it.|S|Bmr010
me013|which is to have people move it uh uh away from being just directly in front of the middle.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|good.|B|Bmr010
me013|but not too far away.|S|Bmr010
fe008|yeah|F|Bmr010
me013|and then you know i think there's not much|D|Bmr010
me013|because you can't you know interfere|D|Bmr010
me013|you can't fine tune the meeting that much i think.|S|Bmr010
me011|right.|S|Bmr010
me013|it's sort of|D|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|that's true.|S|Bmr010
fe008|it just seems like if something simple like that can be tweaked and the quality goes you know uh dramatically up then it might be worth doing.|S|Bmr010
me011|yep.|S|Bmr010
me011|and then also the position of the mike also.|S|Bmr010
me011|if it's more directly you'll get better volume.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me011|so so like yours is pretty far down below your mouth yeah.|S|Bmr010
fe008|but|D|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|my my feedback from the transcribers is he is always close to crystal clear and and just fantastic to|D|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn005|huh yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me011|i don't know why that is.|S|Bmr010
fe008|well i mean you yeah of course you're you're also|D|Bmr010
fe008|uh your volume is is greater.|S|Bmr010
fe008|but but still i mean they they say|D|Bmr010
me011|i've been eating a lot.|S|Bmr010
fe008|it makes their their job extremely easy.|S|Bmr010
me013|uh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|and then there's mass.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|anyway.|S|Bmr010
fe008|i could say something about about the|D|Bmr010
fe008|well i don't know what you want to do yeah.|S|Bmr010
me013|about what?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|about the transcribers or anything or|D|Bmr010
fe008|i don't know.|S|Bmr010
me013|well the other|D|Bmr010
me013|why don't we do that?|Q|Bmr010
mn017|but uh just to to um|D|Bmr010
mn017|one more remark uh concerning the s r i recognizer.|S|Bmr010
mn017|um|F|Bmr010
mn017|it is useful to transcribe and then ultimately train models for things like breath.|S|Bmr010
mn017|and also laughter is very very frequent and important to to model.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn017|so|F|Bmr010
mn017|if you can in your transcripts mark|D|Bmr010
me011|so|F|Bmr010
me011|mark them.|S|Bmr010
mn017|mark very audible breaths and laughter especially.|S|Bmr010
mn014|huh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|they are.|S|Bmr010
mn017|um|F|Bmr010
fe008|they're putting uh so in curly brackets they put inhale or breath.|S|Bmr010
mn017|okay.|S|Bmr010
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me011|oh great.|S|Bmr010
fe008|it they and then in curly brackets they say laughter.|S|Bmr010
fe008|now they're they're not being awfully precise.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uh so they're two types of laughter that are not being distinguished.|S|Bmr010
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|one is when sometimes someone will start laughing when they're in the middle of a sentence.|S|Bmr010
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|and and then the other one is when they finish the sentence and then they laugh.|S|Bmr010
fe008|so um i i did i did some double checking to look through.|S|Bmr010
fe008|i mean you'd need to have extra|D|Bmr010
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr010
fe008|extra complications like time tags indicating the beginning and ending of of the laughing through the utterance.|S|Bmr010
mn017|it's not so i don't think it's um|D|Bmr010
fe008|and that and what they're doing is in both cases just saying curly brackets laughing after the unit.|S|Bmr010
mn017|as as long as there is an indication that there was laughter somewhere between two words i think that's sufficient.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|good.|B|Bmr010
fe008|oh.|S|Bmr010
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr010
me011|against they could do forced alignment.|S|Bmr010
mn017|because|D|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn017|actually the recognition of laughter once you um you know is pretty good.|S|Bmr010
mn017|so as long as you can stick a you know a a tag in there that that indicates that there was laughter.|S|Bmr010
me011|oh i didn't know that.|S|Bmr010
fe008|okay.|B|Bmr010
mn017|that would probably be uh sufficient to train models.|S|Bmr010
me011|that would be a really interesting prosodic feature.|S|Bmr010
fe008|then|D|Bmr010
fe008|and let me ask|D|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|and i got to ask you one thing about that.|S|Bmr010
me011|when|D|Bmr010
fe008|so um|F|Bmr010
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|if they laugh between two words you you'd get it in between the two words.|S|Bmr010
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|but if they laugh across three or four words you you get it after those four words.|S|Bmr010
mn017|right.|S|Bmr010
fe008|does that matter?|Q|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn017|well the thing that you is hard to deal with is when they speak while laughing.|S|Bmr010
mn017|um and that's uh i don't think that we can do very well with that.|S|Bmr010
me011|right.|S|Bmr010
mn017|so|F|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn017|but um that's not as frequent as just laughing between speaking.|S|Bmr010
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr010
mn017|so|F|Bmr010
me011|so are do you treat breath and laughter as phonetically or as word models or what?|Q|Bmr010
me013|is it?|Q|Bmr010
mn005|huh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|i think he's right.|S|Bmr010
mn005|i i think it's frequent in in the meeting.|S|Bmr010
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn017|we tried both.|S|Bmr010
mn017|uh currently um we use special words.|S|Bmr010
mn017|there was a there's actually a word for uh it's not just breathing but all kinds of mouth|D|Bmr010
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me011|mouth stuff.|S|Bmr010
mn017|mouth mouth stuff.|S|Bmr010
mn017|and then laughter is a is a special word.|S|Bmr010
me011|how would we do that with the hybrid system?|Q|Bmr010
me013|same thing.|S|Bmr010
mn017|same thing?|Q|Bmr010
me011|so train a phone in the neural net?|Q|Bmr010
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn017|yeah you oh and each of these words has a dedicated phone.|S|Bmr010
me013|no.|S|Bmr010
me011|oh it does?|Q|Bmr010
mn017|so the so the the mouth noise uh word has just a single phone.|S|Bmr010
mn017|um that is for that.|S|Bmr010
me011|right so in the hybrid system we could train the net with a laughter phone and a breath sound phone.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me013|i mean it's it's it's always the same thing.|S|Bmr010
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me013|right?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|i mean you could you could say well let|D|Bmr010
me013|we now think that laughter should have three sub sub sub units in the the three states uh different states.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|and then you would have three|D|Bmr010
me013|i mean you know uh uh it's|D|Bmr010
mn017|and the the the pronunciations the pronunciations are are somewhat nonstandard.|S|Bmr010
me011|i mean you know you you do whatever you want.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn005|no.|S|Bmr010
mn017|they actually are|D|Bmr010
mn017|uh it's just a single uh you know a single phone in the pronunciation.|S|Bmr010
mn017|but it has a self loop on it.|S|Bmr010
mn017|so it can|D|Bmr010
me011|to go on forever?|Q|Bmr010
mn017|can go on forever.|S|Bmr010
me011|and how do you handle it in the language model?|Q|Bmr010
mn017|it's just a it's just a word.|S|Bmr010
mn017|we train it like any other word.|S|Bmr010
me011|it's just a word in the language model.|S|Bmr010
me011|cool.|S|Bmr010
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn017|we also tried um absorbing these uh both laughter and and actually also noise.|S|Bmr010
mn017|and um|F|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn017|yes.|S|Bmr010
mn017|okay.|S|Bmr010
mn017|anyway we also tried absorbing that into the pause model.|S|Bmr010
mn017|i mean the the the model that that matches the stuff between words.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn017|and um|F|Bmr010
mn017|it didn't work as well so.|S|Bmr010
me011|huh.|S|Bmr010
me011|okay.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me011|can you hand me your digit form?|Q|Bmr010
mn017|sorry.|S|Bmr010
me011|i just want to mark that you did not read digits.|S|Bmr010
me013|okay.|S|Bmr010
me013|say hi for me.|S|Bmr010
fe008|good.|D|Bmr010
fe008|you you did get me to thinking about|D|Bmr010
fe008|i i'm not really sure which is more frequent.|S|Bmr010
fe008|whether laughing.|S|Bmr010
fe008|i think it may be an individual thing some people are more prone to laughing when they're speaking.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah i think|D|Bmr010
me011|i was noticing that with dan in the one that we uh we hand hand segmented.|S|Bmr010
fe008|but i can't|D|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me011|that he has these little chuckles as he talks.|S|Bmr010
fe008|yeah okay.|S|Bmr010
me013|i'm sure it's very individual.|S|Bmr010
me013|and and|F|Bmr010
me013|one thing that that we're not doing of course is we're not claiming to uh get be getting a representation of mankind.|S|Bmr010
me013|in these recordings we have this very very tiny sample of of|D|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me011|speech researchers?|Q|Bmr010
me013|uh yeah.|S|Bmr010
me013|and yeah right.|S|Bmr010
mn005|speech research.|S|Bmr010
me013|so uh who knows?|Q|Bmr010
me013|uh|F|Bmr010
me013|yeah why why don't we just since we're on this vein why don't we just continue with uh what you were going to say about the transcriptions?|Q|Bmr010
me013|and|F|Bmr010
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr010
fe008|um um the i i'm really very i'm extremely fortunate with the people who uh applied and who are transcribing for us.|S|Bmr010
fe008|they are um um uh really perceptive and very um|D|Bmr010
fe008|and i'm not just saying that because they might be hearing this.|S|Bmr010
me011|because they're going to be transcribing it in a few days.|S|Bmr010
fe008|no they're super they're they very quick.|S|Bmr010
me018|okay turn the mikes off and let's talk.|S|Bmr010
fe008|yeah i know i am i'm serious.|S|Bmr010
fe008|they're just super.|S|Bmr010
fe008|so i um you know i i brought them in and um trained them in pairs.|S|Bmr010
fe008|because i think people can raise questions.|S|Bmr010
fe008|you know they think about different things.|S|Bmr010
me011|that's a good idea.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and they think of different|D|Bmr010
fe008|and um|F|Bmr010
fe008|i trained them to uh on about a minute or two of the one that was already transcribed.|S|Bmr010
fe008|this also gives me a sense of|D|Bmr010
fe008|you know i can i can use that later with reference to inter coder reliability kind of issues.|S|Bmr010
fe008|but the main thing was to get them used to the conventions.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and you know the idea of the the size of the unit versus how long it takes to play it back.|S|Bmr010
fe008|so these sort of calibration issues.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and then um i just set them loose.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and they're|D|Bmr010
fe008|they all have already background in using computers.|S|Bmr010
fe008|they're um they're trained in linguistics.|S|Bmr010
me011|good.|B|Bmr010
fe008|they got|D|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me011|oh no!|S|Bmr010
me011|is that good or bad?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|well they're very|D|Bmr010
fe008|they'll so one of them said well you know he really said n.|S|Bmr010
fe008|not really and.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|so what what should i do with that.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|and i said well for our purposes|D|Bmr010
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|i do have a convention if it's an a noncanonical|D|Bmr010
fe008|that one i think we you know with eric's work i sort of figure we we can just treat that as a variant.|S|Bmr010
me013|okay.|B|Bmr010
fe008|but i told them if if there's an obvious speech error uh like i said in one thing|D|Bmr010
me013|yes.|B|Bmr010
fe008|and i gave my my example like i said microfon instead of microphone.|S|Bmr010
fe008|didn't bother|D|Bmr010
fe008|i knew it when i said it.|S|Bmr010
fe008|i remember thinking oh that's not correctly pronounced.|S|Bmr010
fe008|but it but i thought it's not worth fixing.|S|Bmr010
fe008|because often when you're speaking everybody knows what what you mean.|S|Bmr010
me011|you'll self repair.|S|Bmr010
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|but i have a convention that if it's obviously a noncanonical pronunciation a speech error with you know within the realm of resolution that you can tell in this native english american english speaker you know that i didn't mean to say microfon.|S|Bmr010
fe008|then you'd put a little tick at the beginning of the word.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|and that just signals that um this is not standard.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and then in curly brackets pron error.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and um and other than that it's word level.|S|Bmr010
fe008|but you know the fact that they noticed you know the nnn he said nnn not and.|S|Bmr010
fe008|what shall i do with that.|S|Bmr010
fe008|i mean they're very perceptive.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and and several of them are trained in i p a.|S|Bmr010
fe008|they really could do phonetic transcription if if we wanted them to.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|well well you know it might be something we'd want to do with some uh small subset of the whole thing.|S|Bmr010
me011|huh.|D|Bmr010
me011|where were they when we needed them?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|i think|D|Bmr010
me013|we certainly wouldn't want to do it with everything.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and i'm also thinking these people are a terrific pool.|S|Bmr010
fe008|i mean if uh so i i told them that um we don't know if this will continue past the end of the month.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|and i also|D|Bmr010
fe008|i|F|Bmr010
fe008|i think they know that the data source is limited.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and i may not be able to keep them employed till the end of the month.|S|Bmr010
fe008|even although i hope to.|S|Bmr010
me013|the other thing we could do actually uh is uh use them for a more detailed analysis of the overlaps.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and|F|Bmr010
fe008|oh that'd be so super.|S|Bmr010
fe008|they would be so so terrific.|S|Bmr010
me013|right?|Q|Bmr010
me011|i mean this was something that we were talking about.|S|Bmr010
me011|we could get a very detailed overlap if they were willing to transcribe each meeting four or five times.|S|Bmr010
me011|right?|Q|Bmr010
me011|one for each participant.|S|Bmr010
me011|so they could by hand|D|Bmr010
me013|well that's one way to do it.|S|Bmr010
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|but i've been saying the other thing is just go through it for the overlaps.|S|Bmr010
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh that's right.|S|Bmr010
me013|right?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|and with the right interface.|S|Bmr010
me013|given that and and do so instead of doing phonetic uh uh transcription for the whole thing|D|Bmr010
me013|which we know from the steve's experience with the switchboard transcription is you know very very time consuming.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|and and you know it took them i don't know how many months to do to get four hours.|S|Bmr010
me013|and so that hasn't been really our focus.|S|Bmr010
me013|uh we can consider it.|S|Bmr010
me013|but i mean the other thing is since we've been spending so much time thinking about overlaps is is maybe get a much more detailed analysis of the overlaps.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|but anyway i'm i'm open to our consideration.|S|Bmr010
fe008|that'd be great.|D|Bmr010
me013|i i don't want to say that by fiat.|S|Bmr010
mn005|huh.|B|Bmr010
me013|i'm open to every consideration of what are some other kinds of detailed analysis that would be most useful.|S|Bmr010
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|and uh uh|F|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|D|Bmr010
mn005|huh.|B|Bmr010
me013|i i i think this year we we actually uh can do it.|S|Bmr010
fe008|oh wonderful.|S|Bmr010
me013|it's a we have we have due to variations in funding we have we seem to be doing uh very well on money for this this year.|S|Bmr010
me013|and next year we may have have much less.|S|Bmr010
me013|so i don't want to hire a|D|Bmr010
me011|is you mean two thousand one?|Q|Bmr010
me011|calendar year?|Q|Bmr010
me011|or|D|Bmr010
me013|uh i mean calendar year two thousand one.|S|Bmr010
me011|okay.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah so it's uh it's we don't want to hire a bunch of people a long term staff.|S|Bmr010
me011|full time.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh yeah.|B|Bmr010
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|because the the funding that we've gotten is sort of a big chunk for this year.|S|Bmr010
me013|but having temporary people doing some specific thing that we need is actually a perfect match to that kind of uh funding.|S|Bmr010
fe008|wonderful.|F|Bmr010
fe008|and then school will start in in the on the sixteenth.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|so|F|Bmr010
fe008|some of them will have to cut back their hours at that point.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me018|are they working full time now?|Q|Bmr010
me018|or|D|Bmr010
fe008|some of them are.|S|Bmr010
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me011|wow!|S|Bmr010
fe008|well why i wouldn't say forty hour weeks.|S|Bmr010
fe008|no.|S|Bmr010
fe008|but what i mean is|D|Bmr010
fe008|oh i shouldn't say it that way.|S|Bmr010
fe008|because that does sound like forty hour weeks.|S|Bmr010
fe008|no.|S|Bmr010
fe008|i i i would say they're probably they don't have they don't have other things that are taking away their time.|S|Bmr010
me011|i don't see how someone could do forty hours a week on transcription.|S|Bmr010
me018|huh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|but it's|D|Bmr010
fe008|you can't.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah yeah.|S|Bmr010
fe008|no you're right.|S|Bmr010
fe008|it's it would be too taxing.|S|Bmr010
fe008|but um they're putting in a lot of|D|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|and and i checked them over.|S|Bmr010
me013|i|D|Bmr010
fe008|i i i haven't checked them all.|S|Bmr010
fe008|but just spot checking.|S|Bmr010
fe008|they're fantastic.|S|Bmr010
me013|i remember when we were transcribing berp uh uh uh ron kay uh volunteered to to do some of that.|S|Bmr010
me011|i think it would be|D|Bmr010
me013|and he was the first first stuff he did was transcribing chuck.|S|Bmr010
me013|and he's saying you you know i always thought chuck spoke really well.|S|Bmr010
fe008|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|well you know and i also thought liz has this uh you know and i do also this this interest in the types of overlaps that are involved.|S|Bmr010
fe008|these people would be great choices for doing coding of that type if we wanted.|S|Bmr010
me011|we'd have to mark them.|S|Bmr010
fe008|or|F|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|whatever so um|F|Bmr010
mn005|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|D|Bmr010
me011|i think it would also be interesting to have uh a couple of the meetings have more than one transcriber do.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me011|because i'm curious about inter annotator agreement.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|S|Bmr010
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr010
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|that'd be i think that's a a good idea.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|you know there's also the in my mind|D|Bmr010
fe008|i think andreas was leading to this topic.|S|Bmr010
fe008|the idea that um we haven't yet seen the the type of transcript that we get from i b m.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and it may just be you know pristine.|S|Bmr010
fe008|but on the other hand given the lesser interface|D|Bmr010
fe008|because this is you know we've got a good interface.|S|Bmr010
fe008|we've got great headphones|D|Bmr010
fe008|um|F|Bmr010
me013|it could be that they will uh theirs will end up being a kind of first pass or something.|S|Bmr010
fe008|something like that.|S|Bmr010
me013|maybe an elaborate one.|S|Bmr010
me013|because again they probably are going to do these alignments.|S|Bmr010
me013|which will also clear things up.|S|Bmr010
fe008|that's that's true.|S|Bmr010
fe008|although you have to don't you have to start with a close enough approximation of the of the verbal part to be able to|D|Bmr010
me013|well that's that's debatable.|S|Bmr010
me013|right?|Q|Bmr010
me013|i mean so the so the argument is that if your statistical system is good it will in fact uh clean things up.|S|Bmr010
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr010
me013|right?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr010
me013|so it's got its own objective criterion.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|and uh so in principle you could start up with something that was kind of rough|D|Bmr010
me013|i mean to give an example of um something we used to do uh at one point uh back back when chuck was here|D|Bmr010
me013|in early times|D|Bmr010
me013|is we would take|D|Bmr010
me013|take a word and uh have a canonical pronunciation|D|Bmr010
me013|and uh if there was five phones in a word you'd break up the word uh into five equal length pieces.|S|Bmr010
me013|which is completely gross.|S|Bmr010
me011|wrong.|S|Bmr010
me013|right?|Q|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|i mean the timing is off all over the place in just about any word.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|okay.|B|Bmr010
me013|but it's okay.|S|Bmr010
me013|you start off with that and the statistical system.|S|Bmr010
me013|then aligns things.|S|Bmr010
me013|and eventually you get something that doesn't really look too bad.|S|Bmr010
fe008|oh excellent.|B|Bmr010
fe008|okay.|B|Bmr010
me013|so so i think using a a good aligner um actually can can help a lot.|S|Bmr010
me013|um but uh|F|Bmr010
me013|you know they both help each other.|S|Bmr010
me013|if you have a if you have a better starting point then it helps the aligner.|S|Bmr010
me013|if you have a good alignment it helps the uh the human in in taking less time to correct things.|S|Bmr010
me013|so so|F|Bmr010
fe008|excellent.|D|Bmr010
fe008|i guess there's another aspect too.|S|Bmr010
fe008|and i don't know.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uh this this is very possibly a different uh topic.|S|Bmr010
fe008|but uh just let me say with reference to this idea of um higher order organization within meetings.|S|Bmr010
fe008|so like in a|D|Bmr010
fe008|you know the topics that are covered during a meeting with reference to the other uh uses of the data.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|so being able to find where so-and-so talked about such and such.|S|Bmr010
fe008|then um um|F|Bmr010
fe008|i mean i i i did sort of a a rough pass on encoding like episode like level things on the uh transcribed meeting.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|already transcribed meeting.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|and i don't know if um|D|Bmr010
fe008|where that if that's something that we want to do with each meeting.|S|Bmr010
fe008|sort of like a um|D|Bmr010
fe008|it's like a manifest when you get a box full of stuff.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|D|Bmr010
fe008|or or if that's um|D|Bmr010
fe008|i mean i i don't know what uh level of detail would be most useful.|S|Bmr010
fe008|i don't know if that's something that i should do when i look over it or if we want someone else to do or whatever.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|but this issue of the contents of the meeting.|S|Bmr010
fe008|in an outline form.|S|Bmr010
fe008|okay.|F|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|meaning really isn't my thing.|S|Bmr010
me013|um|F|Bmr010
me011|i think it just whoever is interested can do that.|S|Bmr010
me011|i mean so if someone wants to use that data|D|Bmr010
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr010
me013|we're running a little short here.|S|Bmr010
me013|we uh uh trying to|D|Bmr010
fe008|that's fine.|S|Bmr010
fe008|i'm finished.|S|Bmr010
me013|uh was well you know the thing i'm concerned about is we wanted to do these digits.|S|Bmr010
me013|and and i haven't heard uh from jose yet.|S|Bmr010
fe008|oh yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|oh yes!|S|Bmr010
me013|so|F|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn005|okay what do you want?|S|Bmr010
me013|uh|F|Bmr010
me011|we could skip the digits.|S|Bmr010
me011|we don't have to read digits each time.|S|Bmr010
me013|uh|F|Bmr010
me013|i i i think it you know another another bunch of digits|D|Bmr010
me013|more data is good.|S|Bmr010
me011|okay.|S|Bmr010
me013|so so i'd like to do that.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah sure.|B|Bmr010
me013|but i think do you maybe|D|Bmr010
me013|uh|F|Bmr010
me013|did you prepare some whole thing you wanted us just to see?|Q|Bmr010
me013|or what was that?|Q|Bmr010
mn005|yeah it's it's prepared.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me013|uh how long a|D|Bmr010
fe008|oh sorry.|S|Bmr010
mn005|i i think it's it's fast.|S|Bmr010
mn005|because uh i have the results uh of the study of different energy without the law length.|S|Bmr010
mn005|uh um uh|F|Bmr010
mn005|in the in the measurement uh the average uh dividing by the by the um variance.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn005|um i|D|Bmr010
mn005|the other uh the the last uh meeting|D|Bmr010
mn005|uh i don't know if you remain.|S|Bmr010
mn005|we have problem to with the with with the parameter.|S|Bmr010
mn005|with the representations of parameter.|S|Bmr010
me013|yes.|B|Bmr010
mn005|because the the valleys and the peaks in the signal uh look like uh it doesn't follow to the to the energy in the signal.|S|Bmr010
me013|right.|B|Bmr010
mn005|and it was a problem uh with the scale.|S|Bmr010
mn005|uh the scale.|S|Bmr010
me011|with what?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|scale.|S|Bmr010
me011|scale.|S|Bmr010
mn005|uh and i i change the scale and we can see the the variance.|S|Bmr010
me013|okay.|F|Bmr010
me013|but the bottom line is it's still not uh separating out very well.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me013|right?|Q|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me013|okay.|S|Bmr010
mn005|the distribution the distribution is is similar.|S|Bmr010
me013|so that's|D|Bmr010
me013|that's that's enough then.|S|Bmr010
me013|okay.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|no i mean that there's no point in going through all of that if that's the bottom line really.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|so i i think we have to start|D|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|uh i mean there there's two suggestions really.|S|Bmr010
me013|which is uh what we said before is that|D|Bmr010
mn005|huh.|D|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|um|F|Bmr010
me013|it looks like|D|Bmr010
me013|at least that you haven't found an obvious way to normalize.|S|Bmr010
me013|so that the energy is anything like a reliable uh indicator of the overlap.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|um i i'm i'm still a little think that's a little funny these things seems like there should be.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|but but you don't want to keep uh keep knocking at it if it's if you're not getting any any result with that.|S|Bmr010
me013|but i mean the other things that we talked about is uh pitch related things and harmonicity related things.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|D|Bmr010
me013|so which we thought also should be some kind of a reasonable indicator.|S|Bmr010
me013|um|F|Bmr010
me013|but uh|F|Bmr010
me013|a completely different tack on it is the one that was suggested uh by your colleagues in spain.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|D|Bmr010
me013|which is to say don't worry so much about the uh features.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|that is to say use you know as as you're doing with the speech uh nonspeech use some very general features.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|and uh then uh look at it more from the aspect of modeling.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|you know have a have a couple markov models.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|and|F|Bmr010
me013|and uh try to try to determine you know when is when are you in an overlap when are you not in an overlap.|S|Bmr010
mn005|huh.|B|Bmr010
me013|and let the uh uh statistical system determine what's the right way to look at the data.|S|Bmr010
me013|i i um|D|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|D|Bmr010
me013|i think it would be interesting to find individual features and put them together.|S|Bmr010
me013|i think that you'd end up with a better system overall.|S|Bmr010
me013|but given the limitation in time and given the fact that javier's system already exists doing this sort of thing.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|uh but uh|F|Bmr010
me013|its main limitation is that again it's only looking at silences which would|D|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|maybe that's a better place to go.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|so|F|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn005|i i i think that uh the possibility uh can be that uh|D|Bmr010
mn005|thilo uh working uh with a new class.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn005|not only uh nonspeech and speech but uh in in in the speech class.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn005|dividing uh speech uh of from a speaker and overlapping.|S|Bmr010
mn005|to try to to do uh uh a fast a fast uh experiment to to prove that nnn this uh general feature uh can solve the the the problem.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn005|and what|D|Bmr010
mn005|nnn how far is|D|Bmr010
me013|maybe.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn005|and i i have prepared the the pitch tracker now.|S|Bmr010
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn005|and i hope the the next week i will have uh some results and we we will show we will see uh the the parameter the pitch uh tracking in with the program.|S|Bmr010
me013|i see.|S|Bmr010
me013|have you ever looked at the uh uh javier's uh speech segmenter?|Q|Bmr010
mn005|and nnn nnn|F|Bmr010
mn014|no.|S|Bmr010
me013|oh maybe you could you uh show thilo that.|S|Bmr010
mn005|no.|S|Bmr010
mn014|no.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn014|sure.|S|Bmr010
me013|because again the idea is there the limitation there again was that he was he was only using it to look at silence as a as a as a as a putative split point between speakers.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|but if you included uh broadened classes then in principle maybe you can cover the overlap cases.|S|Bmr010
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn014|yeah but i'm not too sure if if we can really represent overlap with with the detector i i i used up to now.|S|Bmr010
me013|uh|B|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|D|Bmr010
mn014|the to speech nonspeech as|D|Bmr010
me011|i think with|D|Bmr010
mn005|uh|F|Bmr010
mn014|it's only speech or it's it's it's nonspeech.|S|Bmr010
me011|that's right but i think javier's|D|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me011|i think javier's might be able to.|S|Bmr010
mn014|so|F|Bmr010
me011|it doesn't have the same uh h m m modeling.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me011|which is i think a drawback.|S|Bmr010
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr010
me011|but uh|F|Bmr010
me013|well it's sort of has a simple one.|S|Bmr010
mn005|huh.|B|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|right?|Q|Bmr010
me013|it's|D|Bmr010
me011|does it?|Q|Bmr010
me013|it's just it's just a isn't it just a gaussian?|Q|Bmr010
me013|for each|D|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn005|huh.|B|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me011|and then he you choose optimal splitting.|S|Bmr010
me013|oh it doesn't have it doesn't have any temporal uh|D|Bmr010
me013|i thought it|D|Bmr010
me011|maybe i'm misremembering but i did not think it had a markov.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me013|i i guess i don't remember either.|S|Bmr010
me013|uh it's been a while.|S|Bmr010
mn005|javier|D|Bmr010
mn014|yeah uh i could have a look at it.|S|Bmr010
me013|uh|F|Bmr010
mn005|you mean uh uh javier program.|S|Bmr010
mn014|so|F|Bmr010
me011|uhhuh.|S|Bmr010
mn005|no javier doesn't worked with uh a markov.|S|Bmr010
me011|yeah i didn't think so.|S|Bmr010
mn005|he only train|D|Bmr010
me013|oh okay so he's just he just computes a gaussian over potential|D|Bmr010
me011|yep.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah it was only gaussian.|S|Bmr010
me013|oh i see i see.|S|Bmr010
me013|and and|F|Bmr010
mn005|this is the idea.|S|Bmr010
me011|and so i i think it would work fine for detecting overlap.|S|Bmr010
me011|it's just uh that it|D|Bmr010
me011|he has the two pass issue that|D|Bmr010
me011|what he does is as a first pass he he he does um a guess at where the divisions might be and he overestimates.|S|Bmr010
me011|and that's just a data reduction step.|S|Bmr010
me011|so that you're not trying at every time interval.|S|Bmr010
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr010
me011|and so those are the putative places where he tries.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr010
me011|and right now he's doing that with silence.|S|Bmr010
me011|and that doesn't work.|S|Bmr010
me011|with the meeting recorder.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me011|so if we used another method to get the first pass i think it would probably work.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah sure.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn014|yeah okay.|F|Bmr010
me011|it's a good method.|S|Bmr010
me011|as long as the as long the segments are long enough.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me011|that's the other problem.|S|Bmr010
me013|o okay so let me go back to what you had though.|S|Bmr010
mn014|so|F|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me013|um|F|Bmr010
me013|the other thing one could do is couldn't|D|Bmr010
mn005|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
me013|i mean it's so you have two categories.|S|Bmr010
me013|and you have markov models for each.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|couldn't you have a third category?|Q|Bmr010
me013|so you have uh you have uh nonspeech single person speech and multiple person speech?|Q|Bmr010
fe008|he has this on his board actually.|S|Bmr010
fe008|don't you have like those those several different categories on the board?|Q|Bmr010
me013|right?|Q|Bmr010
me013|and then you have a markov model for each?|Q|Bmr010
mn014|um|F|Bmr010
mn014|i'm not sure.|S|Bmr010
mn014|i i thought about uh adding uh uh another class too.|S|Bmr010
mn014|but it's not too easy i think the the transition between the different class to model them in in the system i have now.|S|Bmr010
mn014|but it it it could be possible i think.|S|Bmr010
me013|i see.|S|Bmr010
me013|i see.|S|Bmr010
mn014|in principle.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah i mean i|D|Bmr010
me013|this is all pretty gross.|S|Bmr010
me013|i mean the the reason why uh i was suggesting originally that we look at features is because i thought well we're doing something we haven't done before.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|we should at least look at the space and understand|D|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me013|it seems like if two people two or more people talk at once it should get louder.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me013|uh and uh uh there should be some discontinuity in pitch contours.|S|Bmr010
mn014|i had the impression.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|and uh there should overall be a um smaller proportion of the total energy that is explained by any particular harmonic sequence in the spectrum.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me011|right.|S|Bmr010
me013|so those are all things that should be there.|S|Bmr010
me013|so far um uh jose has has been|D|Bmr010
mn005|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|by the way i was told i should be calling you pepe.|S|Bmr010
me013|but|F|Bmr010
me013|by your friends.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|but|F|Bmr010
me013|anyway.|S|Bmr010
me013|um|F|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|uh the has has uh been exploring uh largely the energy issue.|S|Bmr010
me013|and|F|Bmr010
me013|um|F|Bmr010
me013|as with a lot of things it is not uh like this it's not as simple as it sounds.|S|Bmr010
me013|and then there's you know is it energy is it log energy is it l p c residual energy is it is it is it uh delta of those things.|S|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me013|uh what is it|D|Bmr010
me013|obviously just a simple number absolute number isn't going to work.|S|Bmr010
me013|so it should be with compared to what.|S|Bmr010
me013|should there be a long window for the normalizing factor and a short window for what you're looking at?|Q|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|or you know how short should they be.|S|Bmr010
me013|so|F|Bmr010
me013|he's been playing around with a lot of these different things.|S|Bmr010
mn005|huh.|B|Bmr010
me013|and and so far at least has not come up with any combination that really gave you an indicator.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|so|F|Bmr010
me013|i i still have a hunch that there's it's in there some place.|S|Bmr010
me013|but it may be given that you have a limited time here it it just may not be the best thing to to to focus on for the remaining of it.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn005|to overrule yeah.|S|Bmr010
me013|so pitch related and harmonic related i'm i'm somewhat more hopeful for it.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|but it seems like if we just want to get something to work|D|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|that uh their suggestion of of|D|Bmr010
me013|they were suggesting going to markov models.|S|Bmr010
me013|uh but in addition there's an expansion of what javier did.|S|Bmr010
me013|and one of those things looking at the statistical component.|S|Bmr010
mn005|one.|D|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|even if the features that you give it are maybe not ideal for it it's just sort of this general filter bank.|S|Bmr010
me013|or or cepstrum or something um|D|Bmr010
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr010
me013|eee it's in there somewhere probably.|S|Bmr010
mn005|but uh what did you think about the possibility of using the javier software?|Q|Bmr010
mn005|uh i mean the uh the uh the bic criterion.|S|Bmr010
mn005|the the to train the the gaussian.|S|Bmr010
mn005|uh using the the mark uh by hand uh uh to distinguish huh to train overlapping zone and speech zone i mean.|S|Bmr010
mn005|uh i i i think that an interesting uh experiment uh could be uh to prove that huh if|D|Bmr010
mn005|we suppose that uh the the first step i mean the the classifier|D|Bmr010
mn005|what worked?|Q|Bmr010
mn005|the classifier from javier or classifier from thilo?|Q|Bmr010
mn005|what happen with the second step?|Q|Bmr010
mn005|i i mean what what happen with the uh the uh the uh the the clustering process?|Q|Bmr010
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn005|using the the gaussian.|S|Bmr010
me011|you mean javier's?|Q|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me011|what do you mean?|Q|Bmr010
mn005|i i mean that is is enough is enough uh to work well uh to uh separate or to distinguish uh between overlapping zone and uh speaker zone?|Q|Bmr010
mn005|because if if we if we uh nnn develop an classifier and the second step doesn't work well uh we have another problem.|S|Bmr010
me011|i|D|Bmr010
me011|yeah i had tried doing it by hand at one point with a very short sample.|S|Bmr010
me011|and it worked pretty well.|S|Bmr010
me011|but i haven't worked with it a lot.|S|Bmr010
me011|so what i i i took a hand segmented sample.|S|Bmr010
mn005|nnn yeah.|B|Bmr010
me011|and i added ten times the amount of numbers at random.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr010
mn005|oh.|B|Bmr010
me011|and it did pick out pretty good boundaries.|S|Bmr010
mn005|yeah but is is if|D|Bmr010
me011|but this was just very anecdotal sort of thing.|S|Bmr010
mn005|but it's possible with my segmentation by hand that we have information about the the overlapping.|S|Bmr010
me011|right so if we if we fed the hand segmentation to javier's and it doesn't work then we know something's wrong.|S|Bmr010
mn005|uh yeah|F|Bmr010
mn005|the|D|Bmr010
mn005|yeah.|D|Bmr010
mn005|no.|S|Bmr010
mn005|the demonstration by hand segmentation by hand i i i think is the fast experiment.|S|Bmr010
me011|yeah i think that's probably worthwhile doing.|S|Bmr010
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr010
mn005|uh we can prove that the|D|Bmr010
me011|whether it'll work or not.|S|Bmr010
mn005|this kind emphasizes parameter and gaussian.|S|Bmr010
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr010
me011|yep.|S|Bmr010
me011|do you know where his software is?|Q|Bmr010
me011|have you used it at all?|Q|Bmr010
mn005|i i have.|S|Bmr010
mn005|i have.|S|Bmr010
me011|okay.|S|Bmr010
me011|so|F|Bmr010
me011|i i have as well.|S|Bmr010
me011|so if you need need help let me know.|S|Bmr010
mn005|okay.|S|Bmr010
me013|let's read some digits.|S|Bmr010
me011|okay.|S|Bmr010
fe008|uhhuh.|D|Bmr010
me011|uh|B|Bmr010
me011|and we are|D|Bmr010
