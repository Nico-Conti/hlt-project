me013|okay.|S|Bro008
me013|so uh|F|Bro008
me013|you can fill those out uh after actually.|S|Bro008
me013|so|F|Bro008
me013|so i got uh these results from uh stephane.|S|Bro008
me013|also um i think that uh um we might hear later today about other results.|S|Bro008
me013|i think that uh there were some other very good results that we're going to want to compare to.|D|Bro008
me013|but our results from other other places.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah.|F|Bro008
mn007|i'm sorry?|Q|Bro008
mn007|i didn't|D|Bro008
me013|um i got this from you.|D|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro008
me013|and then i sent a note to sunil about because he has been running some other systems.|S|Bro008
me013|other than the the icsi o g i one.|S|Bro008
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro008
mn007|oh yeah.|S|Bro008
me013|so um i want to want to see what that is.|D|Bro008
me013|but uh you know so we'll see what it is comparatively later.|D|Bro008
me013|but it looks like um|D|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|you know most of the time even i mean even though it's true that the overall number for danish we didn't improve it.|S|Bro008
me013|if you look at it individually what it really says is that there's um uh|D|Bro008
me013|looks like out of the six cases between the different kinds of uh matching conditions out of the six cases there's basically um a couple where it stays about the same.|S|Bro008
me013|uh three where it gets better and one where it gets worse.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro008
me013|uh go ahead.|S|Bro008
mn007|actually uh um for the danish there's still some kind of mystery.|S|Bro008
mn007|because um um when we use the straight features we are not able to get these nice number.|S|Bro008
mn007|with the icsi o g i one i mean.|S|Bro008
mn007|we don't have this ninety three seventy eight we have|D|Bro008
fn002|eighty nine forty four.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro008
mn007|uh so uh that's probably something wrong with the features that we get from o g i.|S|Bro008
mn007|uh and sunil is working on on trying to to check everything.|S|Bro008
me013|oh.|S|Bro008
me013|and and we have a little time on that and actually|D|Bro008
me013|so|F|Bro008
mn007|huh?|Q|Bro008
me013|we have a little bit of time on that actually.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro008
me013|we have a day or so.|S|Bro008
me013|so|F|Bro008
me013|when when when do you folks leave?|Q|Bro008
mn007|uh sunday.|S|Bro008
me013|sunday.|S|Bro008
me013|so|F|Bro008
me013|so uh|F|Bro008
me013|yeah.|F|Bro008
me013|until saturday midnight or something we have|D|Bro008
me013|we we have time.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah.|F|Bro008
me013|well that would be good.|S|Bro008
me013|that'd be good.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|uh and you know whenever anybody figures it out they should also for sure email hynek.|S|Bro008
me013|because hynek will be over there telling people what we did.|S|Bro008
me013|so he should know.|S|Bro008
mn007|huh.|B|Bro008
me013|good.|F|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|okay.|F|Bro008
me013|so um|F|Bro008
me013|so we'll we'll hold off on that a little bit.|S|Bro008
me013|i mean even with these results as they are it's it's it's really not that bad.|S|Bro008
me013|but but uh um|F|Bro008
me013|and it looks like the overall result as they are now even without you know any any bugs being fixed is that uh on the the other tasks we had this average of uh uh nine percent or so improvement.|S|Bro008
me013|and here we have somewhat better than that than the danish and somewhat worse than that on the german.|S|Bro008
me013|but i mean it sounds like uh one way or another the methods that we're doing can reduce the error rate from from mel cepstrum down by you know a fourth of them to uh a half of them.|S|Bro008
me013|somewhere in there depending on the exact case.|S|Bro008
me013|so|F|Bro008
me013|so that's good.|S|Bro008
me013|i mean i think that uh one of the things that hynek was talking about was understanding what was in the other really good proposals.|S|Bro008
me013|and|F|Bro008
me013|and trying to see if what should ultimately be proposed is some uh combination of things.|S|Bro008
me013|um if uh|F|Bro008
me013|because there's things that they are doing there that we certainly are not doing.|S|Bro008
me013|and there's things that we're doing that they're not doing.|S|Bro008
me013|and and they all seem like good things.|D|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro008
fn002|huh yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|so|F|Bro008
me013|so|F|Bro008
me018|how much how much better was the best system than ours?|Q|Bro008
me013|well we don't know yet.|S|Bro008
me018|huh.|S|Bro008
me013|uh i mean first place there's still this thing to to work out.|S|Bro008
me013|and second place second thing is that the only results that we have so far from before were really development set results.|S|Bro008
me018|oh okay.|S|Bro008
me013|so i think in this community that's of interest.|S|Bro008
me013|it's not like everything is being pinned on the evaluation set.|S|Bro008
me013|but um for the development set our best result was a little bit short of fifty percent.|S|Bro008
me013|and the best result of any system was about fifty four.|S|Bro008
me013|where these numbers are the uh relative uh reduction in uh word error rate.|S|Bro008
me018|oh.|S|Bro008
me018|okay.|S|Bro008
me013|and um the other systems were uh somewhat lower than that.|S|Bro008
me013|there was actually there was much less of a huge range than there was in aurora one.|S|Bro008
me013|in aurora one there were there were systems that basically didn't improve things.|S|Bro008
me018|huh.|B|Bro008
me013|and here the the worst system still reduced the error rate by thirty three percent or something in development set.|S|Bro008
me018|oh wow!|S|Bro008
me013|so so you know sort of everybody is doing things between well roughly a third of the errors and half the errors being eliminated uh and varying on different test sets and so forth.|D|Bro008
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro008
me013|so i think|D|Bro008
me013|um it's probably a good time to look at what's really going on and seeing if there's a there's a way to combine the best ideas.|S|Bro008
me013|while at the same time not blowing up the amount of uh resources used.|S|Bro008
me013|because that's that's critical for this this test.|S|Bro008
me018|do we know anything about|D|Bro008
me018|who's was it that had the lowest on the dev set?|Q|Bro008
me013|um uh the uh there were two systems that were put forth by a combination of of uh french telecom and alcatel.|S|Bro008
me013|and um they they differed in some respects.|S|Bro008
me013|but they one was called the french telecom alcatel system the other was called the alcatel french telecom system uh which is the biggest difference i think.|D|Bro008
me013|but but there're there're there're some other differences too.|S|Bro008
me013|uh and and uh they both did very well.|S|Bro008
me018|uhhuh.|S|Bro008
me013|you know.|F|Bro008
me013|so um my impression is they also did very well on on the the uh evaluation set.|S|Bro008
me013|but um i i we haven't seen|D|Bro008
me013|you've you haven't seen any final results for that.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah?|Q|Bro008
me018|and they used the main thing that that they used was spectral subtraction?|Q|Bro008
me018|or|D|Bro008
me013|there is a couple pieces to it.|D|Bro008
me013|there's a spectral subtraction style piece it was basically you know wiener filtering.|S|Bro008
me013|and then then there was some some modification of the cepstral parameters where they|D|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro008
mn007|actually something that's close to cepstral mean subtraction.|S|Bro008
mn007|but uh the way the mean is adapted um it's signal dependent.|S|Bro008
mn007|i'm uh|D|Bro008
mn007|so basically the mean is adapted during speech and not during silence.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah.|S|Bro008
mn007|but it's very close to to cepstral mean subtraction.|S|Bro008
me013|but some people have done exactly that sort of thing.|S|Bro008
me013|of of and the i mean it's not to to look in speech only to try to to measure these things during speech.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|that's that's not that uncommon.|S|Bro008
me013|but it it so it looks like they did some some uh reasonable things.|S|Bro008
me013|uh and they're not things that we did precisely.|S|Bro008
me013|we did unreasonable things which because we like to try strange things.|S|Bro008
me013|and and uh and our things worked too.|S|Bro008
me018|huh.|B|Bro008
me013|and so um|F|Bro008
me013|uh it's possible that some combination of these different things that were done would be the best thing to do.|S|Bro008
me013|but the only caveat to that is that everybody's being real conscious of how much memory and how much c p u they're using.|S|Bro008
me013|because these uh standards are supposed to go on cell phones with moderate resources in both respects.|S|Bro008
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro008
me018|did anybody uh do anything with the models as an experiment?|Q|Bro008
me018|or|D|Bro008
me013|uh they didn't report it if they did.|S|Bro008
me018|nobody reported it?|Q|Bro008
me013|yeah.|S|Bro008
me013|i think everybody was focused elsewhere.|S|Bro008
me013|um now one of the things that's nice about what we did is we do have a a uh a filtering which leads to a a uh a reduction in the bandwidth in the modulation spectrum which allows us to downsample.|S|Bro008
me013|so uh as a result of that we have a reduced um transmission rate for the bits.|S|Bro008
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro008
me013|that was misreported the first time out.|S|Bro008
me013|it it said the same amount because for convenience sake in the particular way that this is being tested uh they were repeating the packets.|S|Bro008
me013|so it was they were they they had twenty four hundred bits per second but they were literally creating forty eight hundred bits per second um even though it was just repeated.|S|Bro008
me018|oh.|S|Bro008
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro008
me018|right.|F|Bro008
me013|so uh in practice|D|Bro008
me018|so you could've had a repeat count in there or something.|S|Bro008
me013|well i mean this was just a phoney thing just to to fit into the the software that was testing the errors channel errors and so on.|S|Bro008
me018|oh.|S|Bro008
me013|so|F|Bro008
me018|oh.|S|Bro008
me013|so in reality if you put this this system into uh the field it would be twenty four hundred bits per second not forty eight hundred.|S|Bro008
me013|so|F|Bro008
me013|um so that's a nice feature of what what we did.|S|Bro008
me013|um|F|Bro008
me013|but um well we still have to see how it all comes out.|S|Bro008
me018|huh.|B|Bro008
me013|um and then there's the whole standards process which is another thing altogether.|S|Bro008
me018|when is the development set i mean the uh uh test set results due?|Q|Bro008
me018|like the day before you leave or something?|Q|Bro008
me013|uh probably the day after they leave.|S|Bro008
me013|but we'll have to we'll have to stop it the day before we leave.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah yeah.|S|Bro008
mn007|so|B|Bro008
me018|huh.|S|Bro008
me013|i think i think the the meeting is on the thirteenth or something.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro008
mn007|this tuesday.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|D|Bro008
me013|and uh|F|Bro008
me013|they uh|D|Bro008
me013|right.|F|Bro008
me013|and the the uh results are due like the day before the meeting or something.|S|Bro008
me013|so|F|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro008
mn007|probably.|S|Bro008
mn007|well|D|Bro008
me013|i i think i i think they are.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah well|D|Bro008
me013|yeah.|F|Bro008
me013|so um since we have a bit farther to travel than some of the others uh we'll have to get done a little quicker.|D|Bro008
me013|but um i mean it's just tracing down these bugs.|S|Bro008
me013|i mean just exactly this sort of thing of you know why why these features seem to be behaving differently uh in california than in oregon.|S|Bro008
me018|uhuh.|B|Bro008
me018|huh.|B|Bro008
me013|might have something to do with electricity shortage.|S|Bro008
me013|uh we didn't we didn't have enough electrons here.|D|Bro008
me013|and|D|Bro008
me013|uh but um|F|Bro008
me013|uh i think you know the main reason for having|D|Bro008
me013|i mean it only takes to run the the two test sets in just in computer time is just a day or so.|S|Bro008
me013|right?|Q|Bro008
me013|so|F|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro008
mn007|it's very short interval.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah.|S|Bro008
me013|so i think the the whole reason for having as long as we have which was like a week and a half is is because of bugs like that.|S|Bro008
me013|so|F|Bro008
me013|huh.|F|Bro008
me013|so we're going to end up with these same kind of sheets that have the the percentages and so on just for the|D|Bro008
mn007|yeah so there are two more columns in the sheets too.|S|Bro008
me013|oh i guess it's the same sheets.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro008
mn007|it's the same sheets.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah.|S|Bro008
me013|just with the missing columns filled in.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|D|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|D|Bro008
me013|yeah.|F|Bro008
me013|well that'll be good.|S|Bro008
me013|so i'll i'll disregard these numbers.|S|Bro008
me013|that's that's that's good.|S|Bro008
mn007|so hynek will try to push for trying to combine uh different things?|Q|Bro008
mn007|or|D|Bro008
me013|uh well that's um|D|Bro008
mn007|huh|D|Bro008
me013|yeah|F|Bro008
me013|i mean i think the question is is there is there some advantage.|S|Bro008
me013|i mean you could just take the best system and say that's the standard.|S|Bro008
me013|but the thing is that if different systems are getting at good things um again within the constraint of the resources if there's something simple that you can do.|S|Bro008
me013|now for instance uh it's i think very reasonable to have a standard for the terminal's side and then for the server's side say here's a number of things that could be done.|S|Bro008
me013|so um everything that we did could probably just be added on to what alcatel did.|S|Bro008
me013|and it'd probably work pretty well with them too.|S|Bro008
me013|so|F|Bro008
me013|um uh that's one one aspect of it.|S|Bro008
me013|and then on the terminal's side i don't know how much um memory and and c p u it takes but it seems like the filtering uh|D|Bro008
me013|i mean the v a d stuff they both had.|S|Bro008
me013|right?|Q|Bro008
me013|and um so and they both had some kind of online normalization.|S|Bro008
me013|right?|Q|Bro008
mn007|uh yeah.|S|Bro008
me013|of sorts.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah?|Q|Bro008
me013|so|F|Bro008
me013|so it seems like the main different there is the is the uh filtering.|S|Bro008
me013|and the filtering i think if you can|D|Bro008
me013|it shouldn't take a lot of memory to do that uh and i also wouldn't think the c p u uh would be much either for that part.|S|Bro008
me013|so if you can if you can add those in um then uh you can cut the data rate in half.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|so it seems like the right thing to do is to on the on the terminal's side take what they did if it if it does seem to generalize well to german and danish.|S|Bro008
me013|uh take what they did add in a filter and add in some stuff on the server's side.|S|Bro008
me013|and and and that's probably a reasonable standard.|S|Bro008
me013|um uh|F|Bro008
mn007|they are working on this already?|Q|Bro008
mn007|because yeah sunil told me that he was trying already to put some kind of uh filtering in the france telecom.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah so that's that's that's what|D|Bro008
me013|that would be ideal would be is that they could you know they could actually show that in fact a combination of some sort uh would work even better than what what any of the systems had.|S|Bro008
me013|and um then it would it would uh be something to to discuss in the meeting.|S|Bro008
me013|but uh not clear what will go on.|S|Bro008
me013|um i mean on the one hand um sometimes people are just anxious to get a standard out there.|S|Bro008
me013|i mean you can always have another standard after that.|S|Bro008
me013|but this process has gone on for a while on already.|S|Bro008
me013|and and people might just want to pick something and say okay this is it.|S|Bro008
me013|and then that's a standard.|S|Bro008
me013|uh standards are always optional.|S|Bro008
me013|it's just that uh if you disobey them then you risk not being able to sell your product.|S|Bro008
me013|or uh um|F|Bro008
me013|and people often work on new standards while an old standard is in place and so on.|S|Bro008
me013|so it's not final even if they declared a standard.|S|Bro008
me013|the other hand they might just say they just don't know enough yet to to declare a standard.|S|Bro008
me013|so|F|Bro008
me013|you you you will you will become experts on this and know more far more than me about the this particular standards process once you you go to this meeting.|S|Bro008
me013|so|F|Bro008
me013|be interested in hearing.|S|Bro008
me013|so uh i'd be uh interested in hearing uh your thoughts now.|S|Bro008
me013|i mean you're almost done.|S|Bro008
me013|i mean you're done in the sense that um you may be able to get some new features from sunil and we'll re run it.|S|Bro008
me013|uh but other than that you're you're basically done.|S|Bro008
me013|right?|Q|Bro008
me013|so uh i'm interested in hearing hearing your thoughts about where you think we should go from this.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|i mean we tried a lot of things in a hurry.|S|Bro008
me013|and uh if we can back off from this now and sort of take our time with something and not have doing things quickly be quite so much the constraint what what you think would be the best thing to do.|S|Bro008
mn007|uh well|F|Bro008
mn007|huh|F|Bro008
mn007|well first uh to really have a look at at the speech from these databases.|S|Bro008
mn007|because well we tried several thing.|S|Bro008
mn007|but we did not really look at what's happening and where is the noise and|D|Bro008
me013|okay.|S|Bro008
mn007|uh|F|Bro008
me013|it's a novel idea.|S|Bro008
me013|look at the data.|S|Bro008
me013|okay.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|or more generally i guess what what is causing the degradation.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro008
mn007|actually there is one thing that well um generally we we think that most of the errors are within phoneme classes.|S|Bro008
mn007|and|D|Bro008
mn007|so i think it could be interesting to to see if it i don't think it's still true when we add noise.|S|Bro008
mn007|and so we have i i guess the confusion the confusion matrices are very different when when we have noise and when it's clean speech.|S|Bro008
mn007|and probably there is much more between classes errors for noisy speech.|S|Bro008
me013|uhhuh.|D|Bro008
mn007|and so um|F|Bro008
mn007|yeah so perhaps we could have a a large gain uh just by looking at improving the uh recognition not of phonemes but of phoneme classes simply.|S|Bro008
me013|uhhuh.|D|Bro008
mn007|and which is a a a simpler problem perhaps but which is perhaps important for noisy speech.|S|Bro008
me013|the other thing that strikes me just looking at these numbers is just taking the best cases.|S|Bro008
me013|i mean some of these of course even with all of our our wonderful processing still are horrible kinds of numbers.|S|Bro008
me013|but just take the best case the well matched uh german case after uh well matched danish after we|D|Bro008
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro008
me013|the kind of numbers we're getting are about eight or nine uh percent error per digit.|S|Bro008
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro008
me013|this is obviously not usable.|S|Bro008
me013|right?|Q|Bro008
mn007|no.|S|Bro008
me013|i mean if you have ten digits for a phone number i mean every now and then you'll get it right.|D|Bro008
mn007|sure.|S|Bro008
me013|i mean it's it's uh um|D|Bro008
me013|so i mean the other thing is that uh|D|Bro008
me013|and and and and also um part of what's nice about this is that this is uh um a realistic almost realistic database.|S|Bro008
me013|i mean it's still not people who are really trying to accomplish something.|S|Bro008
me013|but but uh within the artificial setup it isn't noise artificially added you know simulated uh additive noise.|S|Bro008
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro008
me013|it's real noise condition.|S|Bro008
me013|and um the the training the training i guess is always done on the close talking?|Q|Bro008
mn007|no.|S|Bro008
mn007|actually actually the well matched condition is still quite still quite difficult.|S|Bro008
me013|no?|Q|Bro008
mn007|i mean it's they have all these data from the close mike and from the distant mike from different driving condition open window closed window.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah.|B|Bro008
mn007|and they take all of this.|S|Bro008
mn007|and they take seventy percent i think for training and thirty percent for testing.|S|Bro008
fn002|uhhuh.|B|Bro008
mn007|so training is done on different conditions and different microphones.|S|Bro008
mn007|and testing also is done on different microphone and conditions.|S|Bro008
mn007|so probably if we only take the close microphones i guess the results should be much much better than this.|S|Bro008
me013|i see.|S|Bro008
mn007|huh.|D|Bro008
me013|oh okay.|S|Bro008
me013|that explains it partially.|S|Bro008
mn007|uh|F|Bro008
me013|what about|D|Bro008
me013|in so the the|D|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro008
mn007|so there is this the mismatched is um the same kind of thing.|S|Bro008
me013|go ahead.|S|Bro008
mn007|but the driving conditions i mean the speed and the kind of road is different for training and testing.|S|Bro008
mn007|is that right?|Q|Bro008
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro008
mn007|and the last condition is close microphone for training and distant for testing.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro008
me013|uh okay.|S|Bro008
me013|so|F|Bro008
mn007|so so|F|Bro008
me013|i see.|S|Bro008
me013|so yeah.|F|Bro008
me013|so the high so the right so the highly mismatched case is in some sense a good model for what we've been you know typically talking about when we talk about additive noise in|D|Bro008
me013|and so and it does correspond to a realistic situation in the sense that um people might really be trying to uh call out telephone numbers or or something like that in in their cars.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|and they're trying to connect to something.|S|Bro008
mn007|huh.|B|Bro008
me013|um|F|Bro008
mn007|actually yeah it's very close to clean speech training because well because the close microphone and noisy speech testing.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|yeah.|B|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro008
mn007|huh.|B|Bro008
me013|and the well matched condition is what you might imagine that you might be able to approach if you know that this is the application.|S|Bro008
me013|you're going to record a bunch on people in cars and so forth and do these training.|S|Bro008
me013|and then uh when you sell it to somebody they will be a different person with a different car and so on.|S|Bro008
me013|so it's this is an somewhat optimistic view on it.|S|Bro008
me013|uh so you know the real thing is somewhere in between the two.|S|Bro008
me013|uh|F|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|uh but|D|Bro008
mn007|but the i mean the|D|Bro008
me013|even the optimistic one is|D|Bro008
mn007|it doesn't work.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah.|S|Bro008
me013|right.|S|Bro008
mn007|it|D|Bro008
me013|right.|F|Bro008
me013|it doesn't work.|S|Bro008
me013|so in a way that's you know that's sort of the dominant thing.|S|Bro008
me013|is that even say on the development set stuff that we saw the uh the numbers that uh that alcatel was getting when choosing out the best single numbers it was just you know it wasn't good enough for for a a for a real system.|S|Bro008
mn007|huh.|B|Bro008
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro008
me013|you you|D|Bro008
me013|um|F|Bro008
me013|so uh we still have stuff to do.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|uh and uh|F|Bro008
me013|i don't know.|S|Bro008
me013|so looking at the data where you know what's the what's what's what's characteristic.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah i think that's that's a good thing.|S|Bro008
me013|does you have any thoughts about what else you're thinking that you didn't get to that you would like to do if you had more time?|Q|Bro008
me013|uh|D|Bro008
fn002|oh a lot of those thing.|D|Bro008
fn002|because we trying a lot of thing.|S|Bro008
fn002|and we doesn't work we remove these.|S|Bro008
fn002|maybe we trying again with the articulatory feature.|S|Bro008
fn002|i don't know exactly.|S|Bro008
fn002|because we tried we some one experiment that doesn't work.|S|Bro008
fn002|um forgot it something i don't know exactly.|S|Bro008
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro008
fn002|because maybe do better some step the general uh diagram.|S|Bro008
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro008
fn002|i don't know exactly to think what we can improve.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah because a lot of time it's true.|S|Bro008
me013|there were a lot of times when we've tried something and it didn't work right away even though we had an intuition that there should be something there.|S|Bro008
me013|and so then we would just stop it.|S|Bro008
me013|um|F|Bro008
me013|and uh one of the things i don't remember the details on but i remember at some point when you were working with a second stream and you tried a low pass filtering to cepstrum in some case you got|D|Bro008
fn002|m s g yeah.|S|Bro008
me013|well but it was an m s g like thing but it wasn't m s g.|S|Bro008
me013|right?|Q|Bro008
me013|uh you i think in some case you got some little improvement.|S|Bro008
me013|but it was you know sort of a small improvement.|S|Bro008
me013|and it was a a big added complication so you dropped it.|S|Bro008
me013|but um that was just sort of one try.|S|Bro008
me013|right?|Q|Bro008
me013|you just took one filter threw it there.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro008
me013|right?|Q|Bro008
me013|and it seems to me that um if that is an important idea which you know might be that one could work at it for a while as you're saying.|S|Bro008
mn007|huh.|B|Bro008
me013|and uh|F|Bro008
me013|uh and you had you know you had the multi band things also and you know there was issue of that.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro008
fn002|uhhuh.|B|Bro008
me013|um barry's going to be uh continuing working on multi band things as well.|S|Bro008
me013|we were just talking about um some uh some work that we're interested in.|S|Bro008
me013|kind of inspired by the stuff by larry saul with the uh uh learning articulatory feature in i think in the case of his paper with sonorance based on uh multi band information where you have a a combination of gradient learning and uh e m.|S|Bro008
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro008
me013|um and um|F|Bro008
me013|so i think that you know this is a uh this is a neat data set.|S|Bro008
me013|um and then uh as we mentioned before we also have the the new uh digit set coming up from recordings in this room.|S|Bro008
me013|so there's a lot of things to work with.|S|Bro008
me013|um|F|Bro008
me013|and uh|F|Bro008
me013|what i like about it in a way is that uh the results are still so terrible.|S|Bro008
me013|uh uh i mean they're much better than they were you know.|D|Bro008
me013|we're talking about thirty to sixty percent uh error rate reduction.|S|Bro008
me013|that's that's really great stuff to to do that in relatively short time.|S|Bro008
me013|but even after that it's still you know so poor that that uh no one could really use it.|S|Bro008
me013|so um|F|Bro008
me013|i think that's great that because and also because again it's not something|D|Bro008
me013|sometimes we've gotten terrible results by taking some data and artificially you know convolving it with some room response or something.|S|Bro008
me013|and we take a very|D|Bro008
me013|uh at one point uh brian and i went downstairs into the the basement where it was it was in a hallway where it was very reverberant.|S|Bro008
me013|and we we made some recordings there.|S|Bro008
me013|and then we we uh uh made a simulation of the of the room acoustics there and and applied it to other things.|S|Bro008
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro008
me013|and uh|F|Bro008
me013|but it was all pretty artificial.|S|Bro008
me013|and and you know how often would you really try to have your most crucial conversations in this very reverberant hallway.|S|Bro008
me013|um so|F|Bro008
me013|uh this is what's nice about the aurora data and the data here is that is that it's sort of a realistic room situation uh acoustics acoustic situation both terms in noise and reflections and so on.|S|Bro008
me013|and and uh|F|Bro008
me013|uh with something that's still relatively realistic it's still very very hard to do very well.|S|Bro008
me013|so|F|Bro008
me013|yeah.|B|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro008
mn007|so|D|Bro008
mn007|well|F|Bro008
mn007|actually this is that's why we|D|Bro008
mn007|well it's a different kind of data.|S|Bro008
mn007|we're not we're not used to work with this kind of data.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah.|B|Bro008
mn007|that's why we should have a more closer look at what's going on.|S|Bro008
fn002|uhhuh.|B|Bro008
mn007|um|F|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro008
mn007|so this would be the first thing.|S|Bro008
mn007|and then of course try to well kind of debug what was wrong uh when we do aurora test on the m s g particularly and on the multi band.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|yeah.|B|Bro008
mn007|uh|F|Bro008
me013|yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|yeah.|F|Bro008
me013|no i i think there's lots of lots of good things to do with this.|S|Bro008
me013|so|F|Bro008
me013|um|F|Bro008
me013|so let's|D|Bro008
me013|i guess you were going to say something else?|Q|Bro008
me013|oh okay.|S|Bro008
me013|what do you think?|Q|Bro008
me018|about|D|Bro008
me013|anything.|S|Bro008
me018|about other experiments?|Q|Bro008
me018|uh now i'm interested in um uh looking at the experiments where you use um uh data from multiple languages to train the neural net.|S|Bro008
me018|and i don't know how far or if you guys even had a chance to try that but that would be it'd be interesting to me.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah but|D|Bro008
mn007|again it's the kind of of thing that uh we were thinking thinking that it would work but it didn't work.|S|Bro008
mn007|and uh so there is kind of a of not a bug but something wrong in what we are doing perhaps.|D|Bro008
me013|yeah.|B|Bro008
me018|right.|S|Bro008
me018|right.|B|Bro008
me018|right.|B|Bro008
mn007|uh something wrong perhaps in the just in the the fact that the labels are|D|Bro008
mn007|well|F|Bro008
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro008
mn007|what worked best is the hand labeled data.|S|Bro008
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro008
mn007|um|F|Bro008
mn007|uh so yeah.|F|Bro008
mn007|i don't know if we can get some hand labeled data from other languages.|S|Bro008
me018|yeah.|B|Bro008
mn007|it's not so easy to find.|S|Bro008
me018|right.|B|Bro008
mn007|but that would be something interesting to to see.|S|Bro008
me018|yeah.|B|Bro008
me018|yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|also uh i mean there was just the whole notion of having multiple nets that were trained on different data.|S|Bro008
me013|so one form of different data was is from different languages but the other|D|Bro008
me013|well in fact uh in those experiments it wasn't so much combining multiple nets it was a single net that had different|D|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|so first thing is would it be better if they were multiple nets for some reason.|S|Bro008
me013|second thing is never mind the different languages just having acoustic conditions rather than training them all up in one.|S|Bro008
me013|would it be helpful to have different ones?|Q|Bro008
me013|so um|F|Bro008
me013|that was a question that was kind of raised by mike shire's thesis and on in that case in terms of reverberation.|S|Bro008
me013|right?|Q|Bro008
me013|that that sometimes it might be better to do that.|D|Bro008
me013|but um i don't think we know for sure.|S|Bro008
me013|so um|F|Bro008
me013|right.|F|Bro008
me013|so next week we uh won't meet because you'll be in europe.|S|Bro008
me013|when are you two getting back?|Q|Bro008
fn002|um i'm|D|Bro008
mn007|you on friday or on saturday?|Q|Bro008
fn002|sunday.|S|Bro008
mn007|or|D|Bro008
fn002|because it's it's less expensive the price the price the ticket.|S|Bro008
mn007|oh yeah sunday yeah.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah that's right.|S|Bro008
me018|oh.|S|Bro008
me013|you've got to have a saturday overnight.|S|Bro008
me013|right?|Q|Bro008
mn007|i'll be back on tuesday.|S|Bro008
me013|tuesday.|S|Bro008
me018|where's the meeting?|Q|Bro008
me013|uh amsterdam i think.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah amsterdam.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah.|S|Bro008
me018|uhhuh.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|yeah yeah.|B|Bro008
me013|yep.|B|Bro008
me013|um so we'll skip next week and we'll meet two weeks from now.|S|Bro008
me013|and uh i guess the main topic will be uh you telling us what happened.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro008
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro008
me013|uh so|F|Bro008
me013|yeah.|F|Bro008
me013|well if we don't have anything else to discuss we should uh turn off the machine and then say the real nasty things.|S|Bro008
me018|should we do digits first?|Q|Bro008
me006|oh yeah digits.|S|Bro008
me013|oh yeah digits.|S|Bro008
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah.|S|Bro008
me013|good point.|S|Bro008
me013|yeah.|S|Bro008
me013|good thinking.|S|Bro008
me013|why don't you go ahead?|Q|Bro008
me018|okay.|S|Bro008
