me011|and we're going.|S|Bmr028
me011|so the only status|D|Bmr028
me011|well first of all we haven't decided whether we're meeting recorder data issues or recognition this week.|S|Bmr028
me011|i think we were recognition.|S|Bmr028
me013|what was on the list the|D|Bmr028
me013|i mean i sent you a couple things.|S|Bmr028
me013|although i don't remember them.|S|Bmr028
me011|you only sent me one thing which was demo status.|S|Bmr028
me011|and asking which one we were on this week.|S|Bmr028
me013|right.|S|Bmr028
me013|uh that was the second thing.|S|Bmr028
me013|right right.|S|Bmr028
me011|so should we simply assert that this week we are recognition and next week data issues?|Q|Bmr028
fe008|huh.|B|Bmr028
me018|i think that's correct.|S|Bmr028
me011|and|D|Bmr028
fe008|yeah i think so too.|S|Bmr028
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|and uh|F|Bmr028
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|so i think what we should probably do is any quick small stuff we can do every week.|S|Bmr028
me011|so like morgan asked about the demo status.|S|Bmr028
me011|we can go ahead and talk about that a little bit.|S|Bmr028
me011|and then do then alternate in more depth.|S|Bmr028
me013|by the way i'll i i won't be here next thursday.|S|Bmr028
me013|i'll be out of town.|S|Bmr028
me011|okay.|S|Bmr028
me013|but|F|Bmr028
me011|actually i may not be here either.|S|Bmr028
me011|so|F|Bmr028
me011|i got to double check the dates.|S|Bmr028
me011|but anyway.|S|Bmr028
me011|so uh demo status.|S|Bmr028
me011|first of all i did a little thing for liz with the transcriber tool that um first of all it uses the forced alignments.|S|Bmr028
me011|so that the words appear uh in their own segments rather than in long in long chunks.|S|Bmr028
mn017|oh.|B|Bmr028
me011|she said that that she thought that was a much better idea for the other stuff she's working on.|S|Bmr028
mn017|yeah that's great.|S|Bmr028
me011|um|F|Bmr028
me011|and that works fine.|S|Bmr028
me011|except it's even slower to load.|S|Bmr028
me011|it's already pretty slow to load.|S|Bmr028
mn014|yeah it's more segments?|S|Bmr028
me001|it's slow.|S|Bmr028
mn014|or|D|Bmr028
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr028
mn017|is that because the transcripts get longer?|Q|Bmr028
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr028
mn017|the transcript file gets longer.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah yep.|S|Bmr028
mn014|yep.|S|Bmr028
me011|and the transcriber tool is just not very good at at that.|S|Bmr028
mn017|but but that's that's|D|Bmr028
mn017|you didn't have to change the software for that yet.|S|Bmr028
mn017|right?|Q|Bmr028
me011|correct.|S|Bmr028
mn017|it's just formatting the right kind of uh x m l?|Q|Bmr028
me011|yeah it's just writing conversion tools from the format that the aligner.|S|Bmr028
me011|actually he did a s r t file for it.|S|Bmr028
mn017|uhhuh okay.|S|Bmr028
me011|and then just back into transcriber transcriber format.|S|Bmr028
mn017|oh good that's very good okay.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah so my my decision was for the first pass for this demo that liz was talking about i decided that i would do um only enough to get it working as opposed to any coding.|S|Bmr028
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
mn017|right.|B|Bmr028
me011|and so the other thing she wanted to display the stylized f zeroes i think they're called.|S|Bmr028
me011|is that right?|Q|Bmr028
me001|yeah the linear fit.|S|Bmr028
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
me011|and uh|F|Bmr028
me011|so what i did is i just took the file with those in it converted it so that it looks like an audio file.|S|Bmr028
mn017|right.|B|Bmr028
me011|and so you it shows that instead of the wavefile.|S|Bmr028
me011|and so that that's working.|S|Bmr028
mn017|cool.|B|Bmr028
me011|and i think it actually looks pretty good.|S|Bmr028
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
me011|um i'd like someone who's more familiar with it to look at it.|S|Bmr028
me011|because when i was looking at it we seemed to have lots of stuff going on when no one's saying anything.|S|Bmr028
me001|that's just background speech.|S|Bmr028
me011|uh.|S|Bmr028
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me001|so|F|Bmr028
me018|so do you have to pad that out uh so that it looks like it's an eight kilohertz sampled thing?|Q|Bmr028
me011|no i the audio file you can specify any sampling rate.|S|Bmr028
me018|or|D|Bmr028
me011|and so i i specified instead of you know sixteen thousand or eight thousand i specified a hundred.|S|Bmr028
me018|huh.|B|Bmr028
me011|um|F|Bmr028
me011|and the only problem with that is that there's a bug in transcriber.|S|Bmr028
me011|that if the sample rate is too low when it tries to compute the shape file it fails.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
me011|um and crashes.|S|Bmr028
me011|um|F|Bmr028
me011|but the solution to that is just set the option so it doesn't compute the shape file and it will work.|S|Bmr028
me011|and the only problem with that is you can't uh zoom out on it.|S|Bmr028
me011|you can zoom in but not out.|S|Bmr028
me013|what's a shape file?|Q|Bmr028
me011|the shape file is|D|Bmr028
me011|if you think about a wavefile sixteen thousand samples per second is way too many to display on the screen.|S|Bmr028
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
me011|so what transcriber does is it computes a another thing to display based on the waveform.|S|Bmr028
me001|we're talking about we're talking about that demo.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah tried that and it died.|S|Bmr028
me011|and it displays it at|D|Bmr028
me001|yeah did it?|S|Bmr028
me011|and it allows you to show many different resolutions.|S|Bmr028
me011|so there's a little user interface component that lets you select the resolution.|S|Bmr028
fe016|great.|S|Bmr028
me013|i see.|S|Bmr028
me011|and if you don't compute the wavefile you can't zoom out.|S|Bmr028
me011|you can't get a larger view of it.|S|Bmr028
me011|but you can zoom in.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
me011|um|F|Bmr028
me011|and that's all right.|S|Bmr028
me011|because at at a hundred samples that's already pretty far out.|S|Bmr028
me011|and uh so i think it looks pretty good.|S|Bmr028
me011|but i'll let liz look at it and see what she thinks.|S|Bmr028
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
fe016|i i got the wavefile.|S|Bmr028
fe016|but|D|Bmr028
fe016|sorry i got the wavefile.|S|Bmr028
fe016|but i couldn't get the words yet.|S|Bmr028
fe016|but the the wavefile part looks looks good.|S|Bmr028
me011|okay.|S|Bmr028
me011|we should if you were having problems with the words we should figure out why.|S|Bmr028
fe016|i i'll have done i'm probably doing something wrong.|S|Bmr028
me011|okay.|S|Bmr028
fe016|sorry this microphone's moving around.|S|Bmr028
fe016|i can't put this over my ear.|S|Bmr028
fe008|it could do you have to put it in your ear?|Q|Bmr028
me011|you you clip that part over your ear.|S|Bmr028
fe016|i can i can do that.|S|Bmr028
fe016|but there's no orientation where the|D|Bmr028
fe016|darn!|S|Bmr028
me011|we'll all watch liz play with the mike.|S|Bmr028
fe008|does it really need to go in her ear?|Q|Bmr028
me011|um|D|Bmr028
fe008|that that bud.|S|Bmr028
fe008|it doesn't have to go in her ear.|S|Bmr028
fe008|right?|Q|Bmr028
me011|uh no it doesn't have to.|S|Bmr028
me011|but that that's i find that's the only way to wear it.|S|Bmr028
fe008|oh wow.|S|Bmr028
me011|is that the bud's in the ear and that the link is over it.|S|Bmr028
me013|this bud's for|D|Bmr028
me011|but so anyway i think that looks pretty good.|S|Bmr028
me013|no.|S|Bmr028
me011|the only the only other thing we might want to do with that is be able to display more than one waveform.|S|Bmr028
fe016|huh.|B|Bmr028
me011|and that actually shouldn't be too slow.|S|Bmr028
me011|uh because it's much lower resolution than a full waveform.|S|Bmr028
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|the problem with it is just it does require coding.|S|Bmr028
me001|yeah it|D|Bmr028
me011|and so it would be much better to get uh dave gelbart to do that than me.|S|Bmr028
me011|because he's familiar with the code.|S|Bmr028
me011|and is more likely to be able to get it to work quickly.|S|Bmr028
me001|it'd be nice if we can do like a quick hack.|S|Bmr028
me001|just so we can play the audio file too.|S|Bmr028
fe016|right.|S|Bmr028
me001|um with with the display.|S|Bmr028
me011|oh okay.|S|Bmr028
me001|like even if we i think that even if we didn't display the waveform it might be better to rather play the waveform than display it.|S|Bmr028
me001|i mean like if we were to choose i don't know if i were to choose between one or the other i'd rather have it played.|S|Bmr028
me011|uhhuh.|S|Bmr028
me011|i understand what you mean.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me001|and then displayed.|S|Bmr028
me011|right.|S|Bmr028
me011|but for the demo maybe it doesn't matter.|S|Bmr028
me011|i'm not sure whether you want to do the demo live anyway.|S|Bmr028
me011|or just screen shots of what we have.|S|Bmr028
me011|the problem with doing it live is it takes so long to load that um|D|Bmr028
me013|i don't know.|S|Bmr028
mn017|so this the this uh the sluggishness of the loading is all due to the parsing of the x m l format.|S|Bmr028
me011|um i was talking to dave gelbart about that.|S|Bmr028
mn017|right?|Q|Bmr028
me011|and apparently it's not actually the parsing of the x m l raw|D|Bmr028
me011|that going from the x m l to an internal tree structure is pretty fast.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
me011|but then it walks the tree to assemble its internal data structures.|S|Bmr028
me011|and that's slow.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
me018|seems like you should be able to spawn that off into a background process.|S|Bmr028
me018|because not everything is displayed in that tree at once.|S|Bmr028
me018|right?|Q|Bmr028
me011|uh no.|S|Bmr028
me011|but what it does is it actually assembles all the user interface components then.|S|Bmr028
mn017|but|D|Bmr028
me018|right.|B|Bmr028
me011|and then displays all the user interface components.|S|Bmr028
me013|i'm i'm confused.|S|Bmr028
me018|seems like you want to|D|Bmr028
me013|uh is is this downloading something that happens once?|Q|Bmr028
me011|yes.|S|Bmr028
me013|and and then when you display different things it's fine?|Q|Bmr028
me013|so in that case|D|Bmr028
mn017|no whenever you load a new meeting or a new transcript.|S|Bmr028
me011|a new transcript.|S|Bmr028
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr028
me013|well a new meeting a transcript right.|S|Bmr028
mn017|right.|S|Bmr028
me013|but but for but for|D|Bmr028
me011|or audio file.|S|Bmr028
me011|well actually the audio files are pretty fast too.|S|Bmr028
me013|for presentation in uh uh i wouldn't be|D|Bmr028
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr028
me001|yeah.|S|Bmr028
mn017|you just have to have the thing running before you open your laptop.|S|Bmr028
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|right the only problem with that is if anything goes wrong or if you want to switch from one thing to another.|S|Bmr028
fe016|right.|B|Bmr028
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|go wrong?|Q|Bmr028
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|i see yeah.|S|Bmr028
fe016|right i guess for the demo you can always play just store the pieces that you're going to display and play those as separate files if we can't you know actually do it.|S|Bmr028
mn017|just make shorter files.|S|Bmr028
fe016|but it's you know it it's|D|Bmr028
me011|that's true we could just subset it.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr028
me011|that's a good idea.|S|Bmr028
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|that's actually probably the right thing to do.|S|Bmr028
fe016|and just make it|D|Bmr028
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr028
me011|you know just take ten minutes instead of an hour and a half.|S|Bmr028
mn014|yeah that's what i did for for my talk.|S|Bmr028
me013|oh oh you're downloading a whole meeting.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr028
me013|oh yeah that.|S|Bmr028
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|yeah so that that's actually the definitely the way to do it.|S|Bmr028
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr028
me011|that's a good idea.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|and then still do it ahead of time.|S|Bmr028
me013|but then at least you're covered if if uh if there's a problem.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah if there are any problems.|S|Bmr028
fe016|right.|B|Bmr028
me011|yeah i mean even five minutes is probably enough.|S|Bmr028
mn014|huh.|B|Bmr028
fe016|right.|B|Bmr028
fe016|so what happened to is it possible at all to display the words in their aligned locations?|Q|Bmr028
me011|that's what i did.|S|Bmr028
fe016|okay so sorry.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr028
mn017|you missed that part.|S|Bmr028
fe016|i missed|D|Bmr028
fe016|okay great!|S|Bmr028
fe016|but it|D|Bmr028
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr028
fe016|i couldn't get the words and the waveform at the same time for some reason.|S|Bmr028
fe016|and there must be some|D|Bmr028
fe016|i'll i'll work on it with don and see what i'm doing wrong.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah i mean just ask just come by my office.|S|Bmr028
me011|i can show you as well.|S|Bmr028
fe016|okay great well thanks a lot.|S|Bmr028
fe016|that's really great.|S|Bmr028
me011|right.|S|Bmr028
me011|and for the information retrieval uh don has been working on that.|S|Bmr028
me011|so|F|Bmr028
me001|yeah so it's coming along.|S|Bmr028
me011|it looks like|D|Bmr028
me001|um|F|Bmr028
me001|just hacking dan's code and stepping through it.|S|Bmr028
me001|but i think it's close.|S|Bmr028
me011|great.|S|Bmr028
me001|and we should be there pretty soon.|S|Bmr028
me001|with at least like at least with you know being able to search over certain amount of meetings.|S|Bmr028
me001|just like really basic stuff.|S|Bmr028
me001|just asking looking for a word and looking through a bunch of different meetings.|S|Bmr028
me001|and if we have time i'll also add you know like choosing which speakers you want to include and stuff.|S|Bmr028
me001|but|F|Bmr028
me013|okay well i'm going to start working on this the week after next.|S|Bmr028
me013|so that's the point when i'll need to look more carefully at what what what you guys have.|S|Bmr028
me001|so is the end of the month still the the|D|Bmr028
me013|right the week after|D|Bmr028
me013|the monday the week after next is july second.|S|Bmr028
me013|which is the first day i get back.|S|Bmr028
me001|okay.|S|Bmr028
me013|so|F|Bmr028
me001|okay.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah so i think for the stuff liz was talking about we have something that'll work now.|S|Bmr028
me011|and liz can look at it and see if she wants anything else.|S|Bmr028
me011|maybe we can work on doing displaying multiple or displaying one and playing back the other.|S|Bmr028
fe016|so do you think it's reasonable to display more than one before the demo?|Q|Bmr028
fe016|because|D|Bmr028
me011|um i think i'd i'd have to ask dave.|S|Bmr028
me011|i did it once before.|S|Bmr028
me011|and it was just so slow to scroll that i gave up.|S|Bmr028
fe016|huh.|B|Bmr028
me011|but the advantage is that these things are much lower sampling rate.|S|Bmr028
fe016|right.|B|Bmr028
me011|and so then it might be all right.|S|Bmr028
fe016|okay let me know.|S|Bmr028
me001|morgan when's the demo?|Q|Bmr028
me013|well uh i'm giving a talk on july sixteenth.|S|Bmr028
me013|it's a monday in four weeks.|S|Bmr028
mn017|so if if raw speed is the problem this thing is written in tcl.|S|Bmr028
me013|three weeks?|Q|Bmr028
me011|tcl.|S|Bmr028
mn017|right?|Q|Bmr028
mn017|i mean john osterhout uh you know he started his own company based on tcl stuff.|S|Bmr028
mn017|and maybe they have the native code compiler or something.|S|Bmr028
me011|i mean we could check.|S|Bmr028
me011|i don't think they do.|S|Bmr028
me011|um there was actually a java back end that apparently is actually a little faster.|S|Bmr028
me011|it generates byte code.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
me011|but uh|F|Bmr028
me013|it's always exciting to hear that java's faster than something.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr028
me011|well everything is faster than tcl t k.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|it's a string substitution language basically.|S|Bmr028
me011|i should probably beep that out in case john osterhout ever listens.|S|Bmr028
fe008|but tcl is wonderful.|S|Bmr028
me011|but|F|Bmr028
me011|well it is wonderful.|S|Bmr028
me011|it is for prototyping and user interface.|S|Bmr028
me011|it's just really the language is awful.|S|Bmr028
fe008|there you go.|S|Bmr028
fe008|oh.|S|Bmr028
me013|beep.|S|Bmr028
me011|beep.|S|Bmr028
me011|right.|S|Bmr028
me011|but let me tell you how i really feel.|S|Bmr028
me013|we're all entitled to our opinions here.|S|Bmr028
me011|yep.|S|Bmr028
fe008|yeah i like it.|S|Bmr028
me013|um yeah so it's yeah i think it must be three and a half weeks.|S|Bmr028
fe008|it's great.|S|Bmr028
me013|uh because july the the meeting is july sixteenth through eighteenth.|S|Bmr028
me013|and uh my talk's the first day.|S|Bmr028
me013|so|F|Bmr028
me001|okay.|S|Bmr028
me013|i'm flying out there the sunday before.|S|Bmr028
me013|so um|F|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
me013|i guess you know it'd be desirable if a week ahead of that we basically had thought we had it.|S|Bmr028
me013|which would allow a week for|D|Bmr028
me011|oh that's right.|S|Bmr028
me001|for realizing we don't?|Q|Bmr028
me013|re iterating.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah pretty much.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|then the other issue related to that is data release.|S|Bmr028
me011|if we want to show this in public it should be|D|Bmr028
me011|so i uh haven't gotten any other replies from the original email asking for approval.|S|Bmr028
me011|so i sent out another set this morning.|S|Bmr028
me013|i i saw that.|S|Bmr028
me011|and uh we'll see if we get any responses.|S|Bmr028
fe016|i just did it.|S|Bmr028
me011|very good.|S|Bmr028
fe016|but it is|D|Bmr028
fe016|i did want to say that um|D|Bmr028
me011|did you notice i put in the filter?|Q|Bmr028
fe016|no!|S|Bmr028
fe016|no no!|S|Bmr028
me011|go ahead.|S|Bmr028
fe016|i just figured you|D|Bmr028
me011|there's a link there that now says if you want to search by filter by a regular expression you can.|S|Bmr028
fe016|oh my gosh.|S|Bmr028
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr028
me011|i put that in just for you.|S|Bmr028
fe016|terrific.|S|Bmr028
fe016|well since you didn't answer the|D|Bmr028
fe016|so there was a question i had asked adam whether it's possible to search only for your own name your own utterances.|S|Bmr028
fe016|so that you know you don't have to go through the whole meeting.|S|Bmr028
fe016|and um|F|Bmr028
fe016|and i didn't hear back.|S|Bmr028
fe016|so i thought okay it's probably too hard.|S|Bmr028
fe016|he's overloaded.|S|Bmr028
fe016|i won't say anything.|S|Bmr028
fe016|i'll just do it.|S|Bmr028
fe016|great.|S|Bmr028
fe016|okay so anyway i looked at everybody else's|D|Bmr028
me011|it's actually an arbitrary arbitrary regular expression.|S|Bmr028
fe016|good.|S|Bmr028
me011|but if you search your name you'll get all of the things you said and any time anyone said your name.|S|Bmr028
fe016|so|D|Bmr028
fe016|that's great.|S|Bmr028
me011|so|F|Bmr028
me013|and it's it's case insensitive.|S|Bmr028
me011|correct.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe016|that's great.|B|Bmr028
me018|did you actually look through your transcripts?|Q|Bmr028
me018|or you just approved them all?|Q|Bmr028
fe016|uh well|F|Bmr028
me018|i just approved all mine.|S|Bmr028
me018|i didn't look at them.|S|Bmr028
fe016|i sort of spot checked.|S|Bmr028
fe016|i was trying to remember|D|Bmr028
mn017|oh darn!|S|Bmr028
mn017|i haven't done that yet.|S|Bmr028
mn017|uh okay.|S|Bmr028
fe016|i couldn't find the the keywords for things that i thought i had said wrong.|S|Bmr028
fe016|so|F|Bmr028
me011|it's hard to find.|S|Bmr028
fe016|that makes it|D|Bmr028
me018|that's a compliment to you.|S|Bmr028
me018|he said it's hard to find things you say wrong.|S|Bmr028
me011|huh|D|Bmr028
fe016|it's hard to find anything that you say in these.|S|Bmr028
me011|yep.|S|Bmr028
fe016|great.|S|Bmr028
fe016|well thanks for the filter.|S|Bmr028
me011|you really do have to sort of|D|Bmr028
fe016|uh it's really useful|D|Bmr028
fe016|because if you're only at part of a meeting or something.|S|Bmr028
me013|so we have our first information retrieval example.|S|Bmr028
me013|it's a regular expression.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah that's right.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah!|S|Bmr028
me013|searcher.|S|Bmr028
fe016|that's actually well it's useful.|S|Bmr028
me011|and it demonstrates why it doesn't work.|S|Bmr028
me011|because you really want to go more than one meeting.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|and you need a better user interface for displaying the results.|S|Bmr028
fe016|but this helps a lot.|S|Bmr028
me011|so|F|Bmr028
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr028
me013|you want to say where are where find all the contentious things i said.|S|Bmr028
fe016|great thanks.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah really.|S|Bmr028
me018|find everything that should be bleeped.|S|Bmr028
me011|that's right we do have that nice marker is that|D|Bmr028
me011|because we all know we're being recorded whenever anyone says anything like that we then have a conversation about bleeping it out.|S|Bmr028
fe016|right.|B|Bmr028
fe016|yeah you can search for beep or bleep.|S|Bmr028
me011|so|F|Bmr028
me011|yep.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe016|in somebody else's turn.|S|Bmr028
me011|um oh and also we actually have a few people who have still not filled out speaker forms.|S|Bmr028
me011|specifically in the n s a ones.|S|Bmr028
me011|and i noticed that when i tried to uh uh generate the transcripts for n s a that there are a few with no speaker forms.|S|Bmr028
me011|and so uh i have a i sent out yet another this morning which i think makes six total emails that i've sent to these people.|S|Bmr028
me011|and so i think we need to escalate to some other method of trying to contact them.|S|Bmr028
me013|um right.|F|Bmr028
mn017|stalk them at their|D|Bmr028
me013|has has has joachim sokol replied?|Q|Bmr028
mn017|like in the morning when i leave for work.|S|Bmr028
me011|nope.|S|Bmr028
me013|or|D|Bmr028
fe008|i think maybe talk to him first in person.|S|Bmr028
fe008|that's what i would think.|S|Bmr028
me013|he's not around is the only problem.|S|Bmr028
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Bmr028
fe008|oh is that right?|S|Bmr028
fe008|oh i saw him i saw him on tuesday.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah otherwise it'd be a good idea.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah he popped in.|S|Bmr028
me013|but i mean he's basically gone.|S|Bmr028
fe008|oh okay.|S|Bmr028
mn017|cold calling at lunch time uh dinner time i mean.|S|Bmr028
me011|well if i could find phone numbers that would certainly work.|S|Bmr028
fe008|well did you ask lila?|Q|Bmr028
me011|but|F|Bmr028
fe008|because i bet she has this information.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah that's a good idea.|S|Bmr028
me011|i'll ask her if she can track some of them down.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|yeah and and tell her you know tell her your specific problem.|S|Bmr028
me013|she'll fix|D|Bmr028
fe008|and it|D|Bmr028
fe008|and uh then there's still um|D|Bmr028
fe008|miguel is still an active member of the group and he's|D|Bmr028
fe008|what i mean is he's an active member and he's still here.|S|Bmr028
me013|he's right there yeah.|S|Bmr028
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
fe008|very helpful.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah i didn't actually see who they all were.|S|Bmr028
me011|um a couple of them were like people at i b m who were here for one of the i b m meetings.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|and one a guy from s r i who was at one of the s r i meetings.|S|Bmr028
me011|and so uh those might be harder to track down.|S|Bmr028
fe008|most of them though really were visitors here and lila should have contacts with them.|S|Bmr028
me011|yep.|S|Bmr028
fe008|nice meetings by the way.|S|Bmr028
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|i mean they they were people who didn't have accounts at icsi.|S|Bmr028
me011|so they're they're harder to find.|S|Bmr028
fe008|well not the ones that|D|Bmr028
fe008|are you are you sure?|Q|Bmr028
me011|am i sure about what?|Q|Bmr028
fe008|yeah n s a one and n s a three.|S|Bmr028
me011|there were other people also.|S|Bmr028
fe008|we're talking about those?|Q|Bmr028
me011|there were other other people also who didn't fill out the speaker forms in addition to the n s as.|S|Bmr028
me013|in in other meetings.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe008|oh oh i see okay fine.|S|Bmr028
me013|well s r i people easy to find.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|and uh i b m people also just let us know.|S|Bmr028
me013|i mean|D|Bmr028
me013|just we certainly have their email.|S|Bmr028
fe008|but i knew everybody in the n s a meetings.|S|Bmr028
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
fe008|so i'm sure that we have uh fresh you know information on them.|S|Bmr028
me011|right.|B|Bmr028
me011|yeah none of the emails bounced so i know they're going somewhere.|S|Bmr028
fe008|good okay.|S|Bmr028
me013|right.|S|Bmr028
me011|that's all i have.|S|Bmr028
me011|you want to talk about recognition?|Q|Bmr028
mn017|chuck you want to talk about recognition?|Q|Bmr028
me018|i haven't done anything.|S|Bmr028
me011|liz you want to talk about recognition?|Q|Bmr028
me018|i was|D|Bmr028
me011|thilo you want to talk about recognition?|Q|Bmr028
me018|i was away for a couple of days.|S|Bmr028
me018|so|F|Bmr028
me018|i haven't done a|D|Bmr028
fe016|we're sort of in a stage where we're uh don's going through getting some of the next meetings that jane has.|S|Bmr028
fe016|and uh you know creating a second database.|S|Bmr028
fe016|so we haven't actually run anything yet.|S|Bmr028
fe016|we need to get a critical mass for that.|S|Bmr028
mn017|however i just got an email from thilo saying that we are ready to run|D|Bmr028
mn017|i mean we have segmentations for the old meetings that are from his segmenter.|S|Bmr028
fe016|and check the segmentations.|S|Bmr028
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr028
mn017|and so|F|Bmr028
mn017|you you had three different versions with different like pause thresholds between the segments?|Q|Bmr028
fe016|great.|S|Bmr028
mn014|yep yep.|S|Bmr028
mn014|yeah just yeah just smooth the the output of the of the detector.|S|Bmr028
mn017|right and you recommended using the one with two maximum of two seconds?|S|Bmr028
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr028
fe016|a what do you mean a different pause threshold?|Q|Bmr028
mn014|yep.|S|Bmr028
mn017|but two|D|Bmr028
mn014|or you can yeah you can use the one with one second or whatever.|S|Bmr028
fe016|do you mean a|D|Bmr028
mn014|i i i there's no not much difference between the the one second and the two second one.|S|Bmr028
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
mn017|i mean the only advantage to using the longer threshold would be that you run less risk of missing some some speech.|S|Bmr028
me011|backchannel.|S|Bmr028
mn017|right?|Q|Bmr028
mn014|and i think wouldn't it be better to to have a little longer sequences for the recognizer?|Q|Bmr028
mn014|because of the language model as sometimes it happens that that it cuts off within a|D|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr028
mn017|but two seconds is pretty long.|S|Bmr028
mn017|so|F|Bmr028
mn014|yeah but we can be sure that as or we can be not not totally sure.|S|Bmr028
fe016|no it's not bad.|S|Bmr028
fe016|that's good.|S|Bmr028
mn014|but we can be somehow sure that there is nothing not no speech between those.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
mn017|huh|B|Bmr028
fe016|yeah|F|Bmr028
mn014|so it it|D|Bmr028
me018|what does the two second threshold mean?|Q|Bmr028
mn014|i think it doesn't|D|Bmr028
fe016|i i think that's that's good.|S|Bmr028
mn014|it's the same as in the the smoother for the i b m thing.|S|Bmr028
me011|it combines them if it's if the pause is longer than|D|Bmr028
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe016|it's it's no more than six words so roughly on average.|S|Bmr028
me018|uh.|S|Bmr028
mn014|so yeah.|B|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
mn014|so|F|Bmr028
fe016|that's pretty good i think.|S|Bmr028
me011|right so the the trade off is you get longer utterances but you miss fewer utterances.|S|Bmr028
fe016|it's better than a|D|Bmr028
mn014|but yeah but but the the chunks are already in general are short.|S|Bmr028
mn014|so i i i think it would be better to have to have more of them concatenated together in order to have better language model.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
mn014|or language modeling.|S|Bmr028
mn017|i think two seconds huh|D|Bmr028
mn014|i don't know.|S|Bmr028
mn017|i would maybe go with one second.|S|Bmr028
mn017|i don't know it's a|D|Bmr028
me011|well take a look|D|Bmr028
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr028
mn014|do that.|S|Bmr028
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr028
mn017|see what the length distribution is.|S|Bmr028
mn014|yeah but but there's there's really not much difference between the one second and the two second.|S|Bmr028
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr028
mn017|really?|Q|Bmr028
me018|i wouldn't think that the language model would continue across two seconds.|S|Bmr028
mn014|so just take the one the one second one.|S|Bmr028
mn017|uh i'm i'm i'm just scared that with two seconds you get you get um you you get false recognitions.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe016|well yeah you do|D|Bmr028
mn017|you're going to yeah you're going to hurt yourself occasionally by having missing the language model context.|S|Bmr028
mn017|but you might hurt yourself more by having misrecognitions due to background speech or uh noise or whatever.|S|Bmr028
mn014|i i'm not too afraid about that as|D|Bmr028
mn014|when there when there would be something some background speech or something there there would be a a chunk in another channel.|S|Bmr028
mn017|oh i see then oh i see okay.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah i think it's better.|S|Bmr028
mn014|and when there is something in between i i i do not concatenate them.|S|Bmr028
mn017|oh right oh that's|D|Bmr028
fe016|the longer is better.|S|Bmr028
mn014|it's just when there is when they are sequentially and|D|Bmr028
fe016|there's there's|D|Bmr028
mn017|uhhuh okay sure.|S|Bmr028
mn014|so i i would use|D|Bmr028
mn017|we can try them all and see which works better.|S|Bmr028
fe016|there's a there's a lot of these cases just like now where i people say uh uh when they're trying to|D|Bmr028
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
fe016|there's about a half second pause to a second in between and then another word|D|Bmr028
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr028
mn017|okay.|B|Bmr028
fe016|and it's much better if we can keep those together i think.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah it's uh funny looking at some of the transcripts.|S|Bmr028
me011|i was filtering by person.|S|Bmr028
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
me011|and in one of the one of the early meetings one particular person almost the only thing they said the entire meeting was yeah uhhuh.|S|Bmr028
me011|it was just a whole list of them.|S|Bmr028
me011|it was very funny.|S|Bmr028
fe008|i bet i know who that was.|S|Bmr028
mn017|okay so so we need to split the waveforms then.|S|Bmr028
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr028
mn017|or do you already have them split up?|Q|Bmr028
mn017|no you don't.|S|Bmr028
mn017|right?|Q|Bmr028
mn014|no.|S|Bmr028
mn017|so so i guess don would need your help to to create a new set of split uh meetings.|S|Bmr028
me001|sure.|S|Bmr028
fe016|you know you just fake the format that you take as input with the synch times to a new set of synch times.|S|Bmr028
mn017|if|D|Bmr028
mn014|we could|D|Bmr028
mn017|right.|B|Bmr028
mn014|huh|B|Bmr028
me011|uh do we know about disk?|Q|Bmr028
fe016|and|F|Bmr028
mn017|but|D|Bmr028
mn017|oh yeah there's that pressure.|S|Bmr028
me011|uh abbott disk.|S|Bmr028
me013|uh i know they're in.|S|Bmr028
me011|okay.|S|Bmr028
me013|and uh but i don't know i think he was wasn't he asking about|D|Bmr028
me018|he had a problem.|S|Bmr028
me018|right?|Q|Bmr028
me011|yep.|S|Bmr028
mn014|yep.|S|Bmr028
fe016|oh.|S|Bmr028
me013|well there was an issue.|S|Bmr028
me013|he wanted to take it down.|S|Bmr028
me013|and then he tried|D|Bmr028
me018|he did and then it didn't work.|S|Bmr028
me011|couldn't format them.|S|Bmr028
me018|and|F|Bmr028
me011|no.|S|Bmr028
me018|i didn't hear anything after that.|S|Bmr028
me011|the only reason i'm asking is you're going to need space to split them up.|S|Bmr028
me011|and so i wanted to make sure we had some available for you.|S|Bmr028
me001|i still have like probably .six seven eight gig on my disk.|S|Bmr028
me011|okay so we're okay we're still okay for another couple days then.|S|Bmr028
fe016|and i have i have like another un backed i have another six gig which jeremy if you're not using can on x a.|S|Bmr028
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|so we're okay for for a couple weeks then.|S|Bmr028
me013|markham probably needs he probably needs us to approve another time to take things down.|S|Bmr028
fe016|to you.|D|Bmr028
me013|right?|Q|Bmr028
me013|in order to do that.|S|Bmr028
me018|yeah he he didn't say he hasn't said anything to me about it.|S|Bmr028
me013|i thought he i thought he said in that mail that he would need to take it down another time.|S|Bmr028
me013|so i think he|D|Bmr028
me018|yeah i think|D|Bmr028
me011|yeah he just didn't say when.|S|Bmr028
me011|so|F|Bmr028
me018|yeah he|D|Bmr028
me013|well no i think he wanted us to tell him when.|S|Bmr028
fe016|how about during the picnic?|Q|Bmr028
me011|uh.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah i'm sure he'd appreciate that.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah i'm sure he'd love to|D|Bmr028
me011|well my feeling about that|D|Bmr028
me013|fortunately markham's not a transcriber.|S|Bmr028
me013|but um|F|Bmr028
me011|is is|D|Bmr028
fe016|beep.|S|Bmr028
me011|well okay that's the point.|S|Bmr028
me011|so it's jane that we have to coordinate that through.|S|Bmr028
me011|uh what i was going to say is as soon as possible and i'm willing to not work for an hour to get it done.|S|Bmr028
me011|uh but|F|Bmr028
me013|i might not work.|S|Bmr028
mn017|oops i'm sorry.|S|Bmr028
mn014|oops!|S|Bmr028
me001|whoa!|S|Bmr028
me013|i'm i'm willing to not work for an hour.|S|Bmr028
me011|because when abbott's|D|Bmr028
me013|i know you're willing to not work for an hour.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah right.|S|Bmr028
me013|but i|D|Bmr028
me011|because when abbott is down you can't work.|S|Bmr028
fe016|you're really dedicated if you're no matter how you parse that one.|S|Bmr028
mn017|okay.|S|Bmr028
me011|but uh i think the the people it disrupts the most are the transcribers.|S|Bmr028
fe008|well you know uh i all i need to do is mail um send them a mail like two days in advance so they can schedule their time.|S|Bmr028
fe008|i did that with the last outage i i wrote to them letting them know that this|D|Bmr028
me011|okay.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
me013|so okay it sounds like markham should almost decide when he wants to do it and tell us as long as|D|Bmr028
fe008|was not um|D|Bmr028
me011|so early next week.|S|Bmr028
me011|and just as long as we have a little warning.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr028
fe016|so that means we can't um save meeting data either.|S|Bmr028
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe016|right?|Q|Bmr028
me011|uh just not during that time when it's down.|S|Bmr028
me011|but that it should be down for an hour.|S|Bmr028
fe016|so it just can't so we can't have two meetings in a row where the first meeting's during that hour.|S|Bmr028
fe016|that's all i meant.|S|Bmr028
me011|right.|S|Bmr028
me011|well no we can store them here.|S|Bmr028
fe016|that that's happening like today.|S|Bmr028
me011|we can store them here.|S|Bmr028
me011|you we just run the risk that if you have a crash we lose the data.|S|Bmr028
fe016|temporarily.|S|Bmr028
me011|so|F|Bmr028
me018|they're stored on popcorn.|S|Bmr028
fe008|this is on popcorn or|D|Bmr028
fe016|well no i i mean the|D|Bmr028
fe016|oh okay.|S|Bmr028
me011|yep.|B|Bmr028
fe008|this is on popcorn or something?|Q|Bmr028
me011|yep.|S|Bmr028
fe008|yeah okay.|S|Bmr028
me013|we store we store our data on popcorn.|S|Bmr028
me011|anything else?|Q|Bmr028
me013|that's really great.|S|Bmr028
me011|excuse me?|Q|Bmr028
me013|i was just thinking we store our data on popcorn.|S|Bmr028
me013|how many how many institutes can you say do that?|Q|Bmr028
me011|yep.|B|Bmr028
mn017|pop goes the data.|S|Bmr028
me013|okay.|S|Bmr028
me013|uh megabytes and many megabytes too.|S|Bmr028
me013|um what what uh|D|Bmr028
me011|we have a kernel on popcorn too.|S|Bmr028
mn017|right.|B|Bmr028
fe008|that's very good.|S|Bmr028
me013|so uh what what's on your queue for for recognition experiments?|Q|Bmr028
mn017|can i have butter on my meeting?|Q|Bmr028
me013|let's talk about that for a second maybe.|S|Bmr028
fe008|what was the question?|Q|Bmr028
me018|uh|B|Bmr028
me013|what what was on his queue for recognition experiments?|Q|Bmr028
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr028
me018|um i'm rebuilding the net that we're going to use for the tandem stuff.|S|Bmr028
me018|and so what i'm doing is um putting in the stream reader into the quicknet libraries for the s r i feature files.|S|Bmr028
me011|huh.|B|Bmr028
me018|which is the right way to do it.|S|Bmr028
me018|i mean when we did our first experiments and i was uh creating s r i feature files from the icsi front end i just had perl scripts you know and hacked a bunch of stuff together.|S|Bmr028
me018|just to get it going.|S|Bmr028
me018|but the the right way to do it is to integrate it in with the icsi tools.|S|Bmr028
me018|and so|F|Bmr028
me018|that's what i'm doing now.|S|Bmr028
me018|and so once i get that done then i'll generate the p files i need.|S|Bmr028
me018|because we already have the feature files in the s r i format.|S|Bmr028
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
me018|so what i need to do is make it so that the the quicknet stuff can read those.|S|Bmr028
me018|and uh|F|Bmr028
mn017|is that independent?|Q|Bmr028
mn017|or related to also being able to write out the uh feature file in the s r i format?|Q|Bmr028
me018|it's both.|S|Bmr028
me018|there's a there's an input stream and an output stream.|S|Bmr028
me011|input reader and an output stream.|S|Bmr028
mn017|oh okay so then you could use um you could use um uh like feacalc and just specify as an output format|D|Bmr028
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|yeah that's the point.|S|Bmr028
mn017|the the|D|Bmr028
mn017|oh okay.|S|Bmr028
mn017|i'm just ignorant about the software architecture of this thing.|S|Bmr028
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|yeah so if if you|D|Bmr028
me011|right quicknet is a very nice stream based library.|S|Bmr028
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
me011|so without too much effort once he has the classes written we can incorporate it into all the standard tools.|S|Bmr028
mn017|oh cool.|S|Bmr028
me011|so|F|Bmr028
mn017|great.|S|Bmr028
me018|so then it's uh tandem experiments after that?|Q|Bmr028
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
me011|and at some point i'd like to get back to uh porting quicknet to the multiprocessor linux box.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|you know i i have forward passes working but i haven't done training yet.|S|Bmr028
mn017|so speaking of linux so there's some impetus at um s r i to actually uh build support linux as a platform.|S|Bmr028
mn017|so|F|Bmr028
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
mn017|what that means is once we have uh everything running on linux we can|D|Bmr028
mn017|also use a|D|Bmr028
fe016|run all our jobs on your machines|D|Bmr028
mn017|yeah|D|Bmr028
me018|we don't have too many we just have that just have a few linux|D|Bmr028
mn017|i mean if you can't use all the processors on whatever machine we'll help you with that.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah that's right.|S|Bmr028
me011|well that's the nice thing about it is that since it's coarse parallelism you don't have to do anything special.|S|Bmr028
mn017|right exactly.|S|Bmr028
me011|so i mean that would be a fine use for for that machine.|S|Bmr028
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr028
mn017|so it's just uh|D|Bmr028
me011|five more processors.|S|Bmr028
me013|oh i know what it was.|S|Bmr028
mn017|uh yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|um yeah um|F|Bmr028
me013|some|D|Bmr028
mn017|or if uh you know in the future if linux machines become like way cheaper than uh you know solaris machines then you know that wouldn't be a reason not to use linux anymore.|S|Bmr028
me011|yep.|S|Bmr028
mn017|so|F|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|um i think it would be neat at some point in this to do um a recognition uh pass on one of the p z m mikes for these same meetings that you've been|D|Bmr028
mn017|for the meeting?|Q|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|i mean it's going to be terrible.|S|Bmr028
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
me013|but you know we we just don't know how terrible.|S|Bmr028
fe016|it's also an interesting problem to come up with the reference.|S|Bmr028
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
me013|and|D|Bmr028
fe016|so the reference file for the relative times at which|D|Bmr028
me011|oh yeah that's really hard.|S|Bmr028
fe016|so|F|Bmr028
fe016|well it's an interesting question because i was thinking well you can force align the transcriber transcripts and then of course you try to merge them in time.|S|Bmr028
me011|it's not determined.|S|Bmr028
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
fe016|but how do you score?|Q|Bmr028
me011|i think the first pass is throw out words which are overlapped.|S|Bmr028
fe016|i mean it's just an interesting problem.|S|Bmr028
me011|that would be a good first pass.|S|Bmr028
me011|just ignore everything that has any overlap.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
fe016|right i mean there's a whole sort of|D|Bmr028
me013|yeah because you have a set of scores about that.|S|Bmr028
fe016|right we right.|F|Bmr028
me013|so maybe then that wouldn't be so bad.|S|Bmr028
fe016|but there's a whole interesting discussion.|S|Bmr028
fe016|because of course the alignments are not perfect either.|S|Bmr028
me013|oh.|B|Bmr028
fe016|and so um in fact we actually don't have a a|D|Bmr028
me011|right.|B|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe016|i mean it's worth trying.|S|Bmr028
me013|but that'd be a hell of a lot better than what we do with just these.|S|Bmr028
fe016|i|D|Bmr028
me013|and|F|Bmr028
fe016|right right.|B|Bmr028
me013|and and again if you rule out the overlap you have some numbers for that.|S|Bmr028
me013|because that's yet another|D|Bmr028
me013|but i i'm just concerned of course about that|D|Bmr028
fe016|oh i see you mean when only one person is|D|Bmr028
me011|yep.|B|Bmr028
fe016|yes we could we could try|D|Bmr028
me013|because you have scores for that for the other case.|S|Bmr028
fe016|right.|B|Bmr028
fe016|right exactly.|S|Bmr028
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
me013|and|F|Bmr028
fe016|yeah we we should try|D|Bmr028
me013|we just don't know how bad it will be.|S|Bmr028
me013|i mean one of the things that dave was noticing we were talking this morning is that it seems like and we don't know this in detail but it seems like you're getting a lot from the channel adaptation the speaker adaptation and so forth.|S|Bmr028
me001|huh.|B|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
me013|um so you are already in that recognizer doing something that is likely to affect uh the the far field microphone uh formant.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
mn017|right.|B|Bmr028
me013|so it may not|D|Bmr028
me013|i mean it's going to be bad.|S|Bmr028
mn017|right.|B|Bmr028
me013|but uh it may not be like won't decode kind of bad.|S|Bmr028
mn017|right.|B|Bmr028
me013|it might might only be that it goes from forty percent to eighty or something like that.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah eighty percent.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr028
mn017|right.|B|Bmr028
fe016|do you assume you know the speaker when you do this?|Q|Bmr028
me013|i want us to assume the whatever it was you assumed when you did the other the the close mike.|S|Bmr028
mn017|you just you just|D|Bmr028
fe016|well well there there's only one person who it can be.|S|Bmr028
fe016|because they own that microphone.|S|Bmr028
mn017|right.|B|Bmr028
fe016|i'm just wondering there's|D|Bmr028
mn017|yeah that that becomes another problem actually.|S|Bmr028
me001|well and then you have the gender detection.|S|Bmr028
fe016|it's not a|D|Bmr028
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|well but for a|D|Bmr028
me011|but for for scoring you can do it or not do it as you choose.|S|Bmr028
fe016|right and|D|Bmr028
me013|oh i'm|D|Bmr028
fe016|right but in terms of for|D|Bmr028
me011|so|F|Bmr028
me013|but you're saying for this for the adaptation you mean.|S|Bmr028
fe016|right.|B|Bmr028
mn017|so so not well for everything.|S|Bmr028
fe016|for adaptation right.|S|Bmr028
mn017|for for even feature normalization for uh vocal tract length estimation|D|Bmr028
fe016|you know do you do a supervised adaptation|D|Bmr028
me013|right.|B|Bmr028
fe016|all of these adaptations|D|Bmr028
mn017|all of all of these assume you know who's speaking.|S|Bmr028
fe016|assume that the same person|D|Bmr028
mn017|so|F|Bmr028
mn014|huh.|B|Bmr028
mn017|you would have to do a speaker segmentation first on the far field signal.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|well but you can use the|D|Bmr028
me011|when you're doing the scoring since you're you're going to be scoring against transcript you can use|D|Bmr028
mn017|you mean you want to cheat.|S|Bmr028
me011|well you're doing that anyway.|S|Bmr028
fe016|well i was just|D|Bmr028
mn017|no if|D|Bmr028
fe008|ooo!|S|Bmr028
fe008|i don't like that term.|S|Bmr028
me011|so try to cheat in the same way that you're doing with the close talking.|S|Bmr028
fe008|i don't like that term.|S|Bmr028
me013|i|D|Bmr028
fe016|actually the those are two|D|Bmr028
fe008|i don't like that term.|S|Bmr028
me013|i have|D|Bmr028
mn017|okay we we're going to bleep that out.|S|Bmr028
me013|i i have a suggestion.|S|Bmr028
me013|do the simplest thing first.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah right.|S|Bmr028
me013|because we're going to want to know that anyway.|S|Bmr028
fe016|so wait the simplest thing is you cheat saying|D|Bmr028
me013|in other words if you|D|Bmr028
me013|no it's no it's even simpler thing than that is just that you don't know.|S|Bmr028
mn017|you mean you you don't do all those normalizations.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr028
fe016|oh you totally unadapted.|S|Bmr028
me011|just do or a free|D|Bmr028
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah because you can get a number uh for that with the other as well.|S|Bmr028
fe016|uh right.|S|Bmr028
me013|right?|Q|Bmr028
me013|you can turn those things off.|S|Bmr028
me013|right?|Q|Bmr028
mn017|um actually we don't have any models.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr028
mn017|um you can|D|Bmr028
fe016|no you can|D|Bmr028
mn017|um|F|Bmr028
fe016|you can use a speaker uh|D|Bmr028
fe016|what about gender detection?|Q|Bmr028
mn017|actually it's that it's it's we would have to re train models that are not that have none of that stuff uh in it.|S|Bmr028
mn017|but actually we could|D|Bmr028
mn017|we can just run it assuming that it's all one speaker basically.|S|Bmr028
mn017|and see what happens.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|yeah and then put it in correctly and see how much that helps.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr028
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|i mean i was just thinking do the one that's easiest first|D|Bmr028
me013|because you want to know how much that's helping you in these cases anyhow.|S|Bmr028
mn017|actually|D|Bmr028
mn014|but|D|Bmr028
mn014|do you have gender dependent models?|Q|Bmr028
mn017|actually no|D|Bmr028
mn017|sorry.|S|Bmr028
mn014|are the models gender dependent?|Q|Bmr028
me001|huh.|B|Bmr028
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah they're all gender dependent.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr028
mn014|so|F|Bmr028
fe016|yeah so you can|D|Bmr028
me011|so we would have to at least do that.|S|Bmr028
mn017|no actually|D|Bmr028
fe016|no you can run both.|S|Bmr028
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe016|and you can|D|Bmr028
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr028
mn017|no actually what here's here's what we would usually do under these circumstances.|S|Bmr028
me011|and pick whichever is better.|S|Bmr028
mn017|we would actually we would run some sort of segmentation.|S|Bmr028
mn017|thilo's is as good as any probably.|S|Bmr028
mn017|um and then we would do an unsupervised clustering of of the segments to|D|Bmr028
mn017|and and put the similar ones into bins that would be sort of pseudo speakers.|S|Bmr028
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
mn017|and then we would do our standard processing on these pseudo speakers.|S|Bmr028
mn017|and that turns out to work very well on broadcast news spine.|S|Bmr028
mn017|those types of tasks where you don't have the speaker segmentation given to you.|S|Bmr028
me011|does the clustering do you give it sort of a target number of clusters or is it adapted in some way?|Q|Bmr028
mn017|um you can either do it by target number or by some measure of dissimilarity that you use as a threshold.|S|Bmr028
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
me011|that's what i'm just thinking one of the big differences with broadcast news and these meetings is we have many fewer participants.|S|Bmr028
fe016|the other thing is that you actually have direction here.|S|Bmr028
mn017|right.|S|Bmr028
fe016|so unlike these corpora that are recorded with other microphones like the right way to do this i guess you know in the future would be well in general thilo's sitting there and this p z m is going to you know he's roughly in that location.|S|Bmr028
me011|speaker i d.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|well there're different ways of thinking about it.|S|Bmr028
me011|i mean that that would be true if you had a meeting situation with multiple mikes.|S|Bmr028
me011|but if you only had your p d a sitting in front of you|D|Bmr028
fe016|well any case where the people are not all sitting at the same place and they're not moving around too much.|S|Bmr028
me011|and you have more than one mike.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah if you don't have one more than one mike you don't have a very good handle on location.|S|Bmr028
fe016|well you have distance and you have|D|Bmr028
me013|that's it's not enough.|S|Bmr028
fe016|i mean that um jane's the pickup of adam on this mike is going to be different than me in terms of energy and so forth over the whole meeting.|S|Bmr028
me011|oh so just from clustering you might be able to cluster it better because of that.|S|Bmr028
fe016|you might get some clustering from the speaker and some of it from the characteristics of the distance.|S|Bmr028
me013|huh.|B|Bmr028
me011|from mike.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe016|and|F|Bmr028
me013|but say if if you had a a cardioid mike or something sitting someplace then sitting there then it would its its response to him would be about the same as the response to him and so on.|S|Bmr028
me011|and transfer functions.|S|Bmr028
fe016|right exactly.|S|Bmr028
mn017|well you can do you can you you can do certain normalizations like you know gain control|D|Bmr028
me011|well i think there're lots of lots of ways of doing it.|S|Bmr028
fe016|they're both picked up in the clustering i guess.|S|Bmr028
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
mn017|uh before you do the clustering to rule out those those types of things.|S|Bmr028
fe016|or to just do the clustering knowing that you're capturing both.|S|Bmr028
fe016|it's just that the kind of clustering we've done before hasn't had that uh distance factor or location factor in it in the same way.|S|Bmr028
me013|i see.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe016|and so we're not really modeling it directly.|S|Bmr028
fe016|if somebody does we maybe we add that.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
me011|yeah that's an interesting|D|Bmr028
fe016|because i think it would be a pretty big difference.|S|Bmr028
fe016|when you listen you can sort of tell where people are.|S|Bmr028
me011|it's a big difference.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr028
mn017|okay that would be fun fun to try.|S|Bmr028
fe016|not which you know side.|S|Bmr028
fe016|but|D|Bmr028
me011|well humans are really good at that.|S|Bmr028
me011|transfer function through the head and things like that.|S|Bmr028
fe016|right even with one microphone.|S|Bmr028
me011|so you know even if you only have one ear you can still get get good transfers.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe016|right so our our clustering is not going to be intelligent that way.|S|Bmr028
me011|so|F|Bmr028
fe016|it's just going to pick up whatever energy difference or whatever is.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|but anyway i i'd it'd be neat to have that.|S|Bmr028
me013|because you know we've been at this for a little while.|S|Bmr028
me013|and we don't have have any results yet with with conversational speech at a distance.|S|Bmr028
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
mn017|okay.|S|Bmr028
me013|so um|F|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|we should at least get a first one.|S|Bmr028
me011|something.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr028
fe008|huh.|B|Bmr028
me013|um and the other thing this would kind of be a hail mary.|S|Bmr028
fe016|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
me013|but but uh uh dave does have this stuff that is helping on digits.|S|Bmr028
me013|and you know and so with then it'd be you know just throw that in and see.|S|Bmr028
mn017|oh yeah then we should|D|Bmr028
me011|yeah so it'd be cool to see if it helped.|S|Bmr028
mn017|well first you have to filter the whole training set and re train.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr028
me011|that would be quick.|S|Bmr028
fe016|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
me011|since i think he did it in matlab.|S|Bmr028
me013|uh well he can do it in something else.|S|Bmr028
fe008|huh interesting.|S|Bmr028
me011|yep.|B|Bmr028
me013|but i mean you know it's|D|Bmr028
me011|can't you export c from matlab?|Q|Bmr028
me013|um|F|Bmr028
me013|actually we're experimenting with phase stuff now.|S|Bmr028
me011|or is that mathematica?|Q|Bmr028
me013|and and uh this uh first result he got uh was really great.|S|Bmr028
me013|it actually uh uh didn't exactly eliminate the reverberation.|S|Bmr028
me013|but it completely got rid of the speech.|S|Bmr028
mn017|oh.|S|Bmr028
mn017|that would solve all of our problems.|S|Bmr028
fe008|wow.|D|Bmr028
me013|yeah well i was thinking that.|S|Bmr028
mn017|wouldn't it?|Q|Bmr028
me011|well so just take the inverse and you're fine.|S|Bmr028
me013|so it's|D|Bmr028
me013|that's|D|Bmr028
me013|you think i didn't tell him that?|Q|Bmr028
me013|no i got pretty excited.|S|Bmr028
me013|because it completely got rid of the speech.|S|Bmr028
me013|so i was thinking well so|D|Bmr028
me011|so that's a speech detector.|S|Bmr028
me011|that's great.|S|Bmr028
fe008|that's interesting.|S|Bmr028
me013|you know it could be useful for lots of things.|S|Bmr028
me013|so we have to|D|Bmr028
fe008|did it get rid of other stuff too though?|Q|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
me013|what?|Q|Bmr028
fe008|did it get rid of other stuff besides the speech?|Q|Bmr028
me011|yeah just subtract that|D|Bmr028
me013|well we have to sort of check that out.|S|Bmr028
me011|subtract that from the original signal and you're set.|S|Bmr028
me013|that's|D|Bmr028
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr028
fe008|wow interesting.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
mn017|right then you can do like an you can estimate the the noise estimates.|S|Bmr028
me011|noise estimate.|S|Bmr028
me011|signal to noise.|S|Bmr028
mn017|right yeah.|S|Bmr028
me011|that's great.|S|Bmr028
fe016|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
me013|reminds me of when when herve and i were first playing with uh context dependent things for nets.|S|Bmr028
me013|and and at one point we took out the speech input.|S|Bmr028
me013|so we only had priors and our performance went up.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
fe008|wow.|S|Bmr028
me011|i guess that's why herve always talks about using the priors as one of the mixtures in in his all ways combos.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|well of course it was a bug.|S|Bmr028
me013|but i mean it's it's a but it was pretty it was pretty funny anyway.|S|Bmr028
me011|but still|D|Bmr028
fe008|wow interesting.|S|Bmr028
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe008|huh.|B|Bmr028
me011|so if you run uh your recognizer with all probabilities equal what do you get out?|Q|Bmr028
me011|probably garbage.|S|Bmr028
me018|whatever the language model says.|S|Bmr028
me011|i bet the pruning|D|Bmr028
mn014|yep.|S|Bmr028
me011|the pruning probably prunes everything out.|S|Bmr028
mn017|you get out switchboard.|S|Bmr028
mn017|that's just the the language model.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah that's right.|S|Bmr028
me013|so that's how it was generated.|S|Bmr028
mn017|yeah so we have this new speaker adaptation.|S|Bmr028
mn017|um|F|Bmr028
mn017|a oh it's a sort of feature normalization.|S|Bmr028
mn017|uh like speaker adaptation.|S|Bmr028
mn017|which uh which i which i wrote about in the last status report.|S|Bmr028
mn017|which seems to be helping about a percent and a half on hub five.|S|Bmr028
mn017|so um we haven't tried that yet on the meetings.|S|Bmr028
mn017|uh but hopefully it'll help there too.|S|Bmr028
fe008|i want to ask um so you know that the data i have upgraded it considerably.|S|Bmr028
fe008|so i've probably made i probably corrected something like|D|Bmr028
fe008|well|D|Bmr028
fe008|it's really a substantial amount of things that i've caught changed um added to it.|S|Bmr028
fe008|including a lot of uh backchannels.|S|Bmr028
fe008|so when you're running things if you run it on the old|D|Bmr028
fe008|so if you if you run it on the new version then the numbers will be um and you compare it to the to runs on the old version then you're going to end up with more of an improvement than would actually be the case.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
me011|different.|S|Bmr028
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
mn017|well we we have a frozen we do all our experiments with a frozen version of the transcripts as of i don't know.|S|Bmr028
fe008|as of february?|Q|Bmr028
mn017|as of|D|Bmr028
mn017|no a little|D|Bmr028
mn017|i don't know.|S|Bmr028
mn017|when when did we grab the transcripts?|Q|Bmr028
fe008|so a like the h l t paper?|Q|Bmr028
me001|the for the it was march probably.|S|Bmr028
fe016|sorry.|S|Bmr028
mn017|the|D|Bmr028
fe016|for these meetings?|Q|Bmr028
mn017|we're talking about which which version we're using for evaluating the recognition.|S|Bmr028
mn017|which version of the transcripts.|S|Bmr028
fe016|right they're somewhere in between january and late march or something like that.|S|Bmr028
me001|yeah something around there.|S|Bmr028
fe008|okay well so long as you have the same baseline then you'll be able to tell.|S|Bmr028
me011|but they are channelized ones though?|Q|Bmr028
mn017|no no.|S|Bmr028
mn017|yeah obviously yeah.|S|Bmr028
fe016|they're meetings that are now channelized but they were not from|D|Bmr028
fe008|so long as so long as it's the same baseline you'll be able to tell.|S|Bmr028
mn017|the uh the other thing is|D|Bmr028
mn017|the the|D|Bmr028
fe008|but but i'm just i'm just saying that if you were to compare that with running that on the new data that it would be an a more optimistic outcome.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh and|D|Bmr028
mn017|well the and the other thing is it takes only a a minute to rescore all the old outputs with|D|Bmr028
mn017|if you had new transcripts then we we just rescore the old|D|Bmr028
me011|right because you haven't done any training.|S|Bmr028
mn017|sorry?|Q|Bmr028
me011|right because we're not doing it for training.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah we haven't modified the recognizer at all.|S|Bmr028
me011|right so it's really it would be really easy to re do it.|S|Bmr028
fe016|so actually um at some point we should update and rescore everything with you know the corrected transcripts.|S|Bmr028
mn017|we just we save|D|Bmr028
me011|yeah it'd be interesting just to see how much it changes.|S|Bmr028
mn017|well the the|D|Bmr028
fe016|just to|D|Bmr028
me011|i bet it wouldn't change a lot.|S|Bmr028
mn017|right.|S|Bmr028
me001|what are the nature of most of the changes?|Q|Bmr028
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|we can take we can have a pool.|S|Bmr028
fe016|sometimes the changes are um cases where the recognizer would get it wrong anyway.|S|Bmr028
fe016|because it was some word that we didn't have in the vocabulary.|S|Bmr028
me011|that's just what i was thinking.|S|Bmr028
mn017|so i i the thing is when|D|Bmr028
fe016|or|D|Bmr028
fe016|but it does help to get the backchannels back in and things like that.|S|Bmr028
mn017|right.|B|Bmr028
mn017|so whenever the right now the the scoring is based on segments.|S|Bmr028
mn017|um which is not great.|S|Bmr028
mn017|because for instance|D|Bmr028
mn017|so so the the other way to do the scoring is using a a nist format called s t m s.|S|Bmr028
mn017|uh segment time marked.|S|Bmr028
me011|yep i we know about it.|S|Bmr028
mn017|where|D|Bmr028
mn017|so um i have to convert the uh transcripts into this format and then the scoring program actually looks at the times.|S|Bmr028
mn017|and uh you know it you can have a different segmentation in your recognizer output than in your references.|S|Bmr028
mn017|and it will still do the right thing.|S|Bmr028
mn017|so that's what we need to basically uh to|D|Bmr028
mn017|huh?|Q|Bmr028
me011|transcriber will export s t m.|S|Bmr028
mn017|oh.|S|Bmr028
me011|in case you care.|S|Bmr028
mn017|well but then there's other changes.|S|Bmr028
mn017|so i mean there's other|D|Bmr028
me011|okay.|S|Bmr028
mn017|we we strip away a lot of the mark up uh in the transcripts.|S|Bmr028
mn017|which you know isn't relevant to the scoring of the speech recognition output.|S|Bmr028
me011|right.|B|Bmr028
mn017|so|F|Bmr028
fe016|would that doesn't that only change the scoring if a word has moved into a different segment?|Q|Bmr028
fe016|i mean i don't think that's i hardly ever see that.|S|Bmr028
fe016|i think most of them are pretty good.|S|Bmr028
mn017|no i mean if|D|Bmr028
mn017|i i assume you also changed some boundaries.|S|Bmr028
fe008|huh i did.|S|Bmr028
mn017|right?|Q|Bmr028
mn017|so if we want to use new transcripts with a different segmentation then we can't use them in the current way we do scoring.|S|Bmr028
mn017|we have to switch to this|D|Bmr028
fe016|oh you mean you would need to re run the recognition.|S|Bmr028
mn017|no we have to|D|Bmr028
mn017|there's a difference|D|Bmr028
fe016|i mean if you re ran the recognition then you just run it|D|Bmr028
mn017|right right.|S|Bmr028
fe016|oh i see.|S|Bmr028
fe016|if you want to use the old|D|Bmr028
fe016|you can actually never though really infer what you would get with a different|D|Bmr028
mn017|that's true.|S|Bmr028
fe016|you know it's it's probably more fair to re run the whole re run that.|S|Bmr028
fe016|uh in other words it's not really a scoring script problem.|S|Bmr028
fe016|it's|D|Bmr028
mn017|no but if you just want to see what|D|Bmr028
mn017|like suppose you fixed some no jane fixed some typos and you want to see what effect does that have on the word error.|S|Bmr028
mn017|then we can we|D|Bmr028
me011|right but but if the segments change that won't work.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe016|you it'll sort of work but it's not exactly what you would maybe get from recognition.|S|Bmr028
me011|well i mean what happens if you break one segment into two?|Q|Bmr028
fe016|you never know.|S|Bmr028
me011|suddenly they don't match at all and you can't line them up anymore.|S|Bmr028
mn017|no but that's what the|D|Bmr028
mn017|well that's what i'm saying.|S|Bmr028
fe016|well you you you|D|Bmr028
mn017|you can line them up based on the times.|S|Bmr028
fe016|you can|D|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr028
mn017|so the scoring program with if you give it an s t m reference file it will actually compare the words based on their time marks.|S|Bmr028
me011|right.|B|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr028
mn017|so therefore you can|D|Bmr028
mn017|um|F|Bmr028
me011|does s t m do it per word or per utterance?|Q|Bmr028
mn017|it's per utterance.|S|Bmr028
mn017|but it it allows as long as you hypothesize the word in the right segment in the reference it gives you credit for that.|S|Bmr028
me011|what i thought.|S|Bmr028
me011|all right.|S|Bmr028
mn017|so it does a it does a word alignment like you have to do for scoring.|S|Bmr028
fe016|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
me011|and then it does also some|D|Bmr028
mn017|but it constrains the words to lie within the the time bins of the reference.|S|Bmr028
me011|within the segment.|S|Bmr028
me011|yep.|B|Bmr028
me011|i see.|S|Bmr028
mn017|and for you to get a credit for it.|S|Bmr028
mn017|so|F|Bmr028
fe008|that sounds great.|S|Bmr028
mn017|so so it's it should be just a straightforward re formatting issue of the references.|S|Bmr028
mn017|so|F|Bmr028
fe008|yeah i mean i was thinking the other day that this is not just conversational speech.|S|Bmr028
fe008|the fact that is has so much technological jargon in it it makes it considerably harder to um to transcribe and to to double check and all those things.|S|Bmr028
fe008|so i think you're going to find a substantial gain in terms of the word accuracy.|S|Bmr028
fe008|so long as those words are in your vocabulary.|S|Bmr028
fe016|well it definitely helps with um forced alignment too.|S|Bmr028
me011|one percent.|S|Bmr028
fe016|because you know when we know the the the true words and we're adding them to the vocabulary and training a language model and so forth for future meetings especially the like the front end meetings or meetings with a lot of jargon in them that is not represented in switchboard or callhome then it then it really helps.|S|Bmr028
fe008|well all of them are all of our all of our meetings have a lot of jargon in them but we know what those words are.|S|Bmr028
fe016|so|F|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr028
fe008|i mean i don't know how you get them into the vocabulary.|S|Bmr028
fe008|but it would seem|D|Bmr028
fe008|now i have to i have to i really need to uh raise a question about the term cheating.|S|Bmr028
fe008|okay?|Q|Bmr028
fe008|and the reason is um if i understand that cheating is a term which is used to apply for basically what all of linguistics corpus linguistics does and what what my transcribers are doing and what i do which is a methodology whereby you actually physically mark things in the data.|S|Bmr028
me011|all|D|Bmr028
fe008|like the transcription.|S|Bmr028
fe008|like the words that are actually there.|S|Bmr028
me011|all we mean by that is that we're giving the recognizer more information than it would have if you were running it raw.|S|Bmr028
me011|over a meeting that no person has ever listened to or transcribed.|S|Bmr028
fe008|okay i mean that that part is okay.|S|Bmr028
fe008|but i but i do wonder sometimes if it might be possible to use a term that's a little bit less evaluative like um hand marked.|S|Bmr028
me013|uh but cheating is is|D|Bmr028
me013|sure but but cheating is is is pretty commonly used to mean this.|S|Bmr028
mn017|it's a it's a technical term.|S|Bmr028
fe016|it i guess it it's been around for a long time.|S|Bmr028
me013|it really is|D|Bmr028
me011|it is yep.|S|Bmr028
fe016|and it it's sort of um because it's so strong a word people don't take it that seriously.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah|D|Bmr028
fe016|in it's not negatively viewed.|S|Bmr028
fe016|it just really means|D|Bmr028
me013|it's|D|Bmr028
me013|it's even more than that.|S|Bmr028
me013|i think it it really gives a very strong perspective that you know that what you were doing is not an un biased experiment.|S|Bmr028
me013|if you don't say that then people think oh they did that and they threw that but that doesn't represent what would happen in the real world.|S|Bmr028
me013|but if you say we did a cheating experiment which is really the standard way you'd say it it says you deliberately put in a piece of information that you would not have in the real world so that you can learn something.|S|Bmr028
me013|just as part as your process.|S|Bmr028
me013|so it's i i don't know.|S|Bmr028
me013|i|D|Bmr028
fe008|okay i guess what i'm i'm thinking is just in if uh when these are presented in an interdisciplinary context it might be nice to add that explanation.|S|Bmr028
fe008|because otherwise it sounds like a pejorative statement on an alternative methodology.|S|Bmr028
fe008|because it sounds like it sort of devalues the the um all other approach which is to to put those distinctions in.|S|Bmr028
me013|maybe i i've heard this at i c s l p for years and years and years though.|S|Bmr028
me013|i mean it's it's pretty pretty common people say this.|S|Bmr028
mn017|if well you in a to a broader audience you could call it a diagnostic experiment rather than a cheating experiment.|S|Bmr028
fe016|actually jane is right.|S|Bmr028
fe016|like in conversation analysis i've never heard people use this.|S|Bmr028
fe016|because they're not using an automatic system.|S|Bmr028
fe016|so it really|D|Bmr028
mn017|but they don't run experiments.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe016|right i'm well|D|Bmr028
fe008|they can do experiments.|S|Bmr028
fe016|you can do experiments.|S|Bmr028
fe016|but the it's cheating relative to what we call a system where we can completely control this black box.|S|Bmr028
fe016|and it's not a very smart system.|S|Bmr028
fe016|it it only knows what we give it.|S|Bmr028
fe016|and if if it knows more than we would really give it when it runs we call it cheating.|S|Bmr028
fe016|but it's|D|Bmr028
fe016|yeah it's only used in a community that does some type of computational modeling.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah in pattern recognition or in|D|Bmr028
fe016|i think it's really not used in any kind of community doing experiments on human perception.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe016|or|D|Bmr028
me013|right.|F|Bmr028
fe016|you know so she certainly can define it.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah it's machine machine experiments.|S|Bmr028
me013|um i mean when when the uh the neural net uh wave hit in the mid-eighties|D|Bmr028
me013|and by the late eighties there were uh we were reviewing thousands of papers that were coming out in neural nets.|S|Bmr028
me013|it was really hot.|S|Bmr028
me013|everybody thought it would do everything.|S|Bmr028
me013|um and a really common error that people were making was they were just reporting their uh uh classification results on the data that they were training on.|S|Bmr028
me013|and so i think it was it was it was very important for people then who were doing something diagnostic to say hey i know i'm doing something that isn't kosher.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
me013|and to make it really clear that they knew it.|S|Bmr028
me013|so that was i think why why it became a popular term.|S|Bmr028
fe008|yeah it just seems like you know if it were bootstrapping or if it were i mean there are other ways to maybe get the point across.|S|Bmr028
me013|but it isn't bootstrapping.|S|Bmr028
me013|uh it's it's really cheating.|S|Bmr028
me011|it's it's using information you wouldn't normally have.|S|Bmr028
me013|it's just|D|Bmr028
me013|yeah yeah.|S|Bmr028
fe008|well okay.|S|Bmr028
me013|but it's cheating in a way that's it's it's announcing to everybody hey i'm cheating by doing this.|S|Bmr028
me011|so|F|Bmr028
me013|it's saying so it's all above the table.|S|Bmr028
me013|i'm actually using this other thing.|S|Bmr028
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr028
me013|that's that's that's the reason.|S|Bmr028
fe008|okay all right.|S|Bmr028
me013|bootstrapping would imply it was actually legitimate in some kind of way.|S|Bmr028
me011|huh.|B|Bmr028
fe008|well i i think|D|Bmr028
me013|but|D|Bmr028
me011|we're not de legitimizing the data.|S|Bmr028
me011|we're de legitimizing the experiment.|S|Bmr028
me011|we're not saying that the data is cheating data.|S|Bmr028
me011|we're saying we are cheating by using this data.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr028
me011|because normally you wouldn't have that data available.|S|Bmr028
fe008|okay okay.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|anyway.|F|Bmr028
fe008|does seem to me that it that it carries over some baggage with it that uh that|D|Bmr028
fe008|i can understand it in context as you described it.|S|Bmr028
fe008|but it it seems to me that um it does import some negative evaluation that um would maybe not be good if|D|Bmr028
me013|it has some shock value.|S|Bmr028
fe008|it has shock value.|S|Bmr028
fe008|and|D|Bmr028
me013|which is part of why it's used.|S|Bmr028
fe008|to the to the wrong audience i think that that might be a negative shock.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah i i think to the wrong audience i agree that um|D|Bmr028
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
mn017|it's like a disclaimer.|S|Bmr028
fe016|to the wrong we should just explain what it what it means here and that it's a common term.|S|Bmr028
fe008|yeah we started with hand marked data or with uh you know hand transcribed data.|S|Bmr028
fe016|and|D|Bmr028
fe016|we're|D|Bmr028
fe008|or|D|Bmr028
me011|shoot!|S|Bmr028
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe008|did you break the microphone?|Q|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|just the clip.|S|Bmr028
fe008|nnn okay.|S|Bmr028
mn017|now we have to delete that expletive.|S|Bmr028
fe008|okay well i feel better now.|S|Bmr028
fe008|thank you very much.|S|Bmr028
fe016|huh the first time i heard that i i thought you know the same thing.|S|Bmr028
me001|thank you andreas.|S|Bmr028
fe016|and i guess you after a while it becomes almost a it's a bit of a a humbling thing when somebody says that.|S|Bmr028
me011|it's it it really is part of the jargon.|S|Bmr028
me013|but it's also is|D|Bmr028
fe016|if they get good results but we were cheating on this feature because we took it for granted even though we can't really assume that then it's actually the opposite.|S|Bmr028
me013|right.|S|Bmr028
fe016|it's|D|Bmr028
fe008|the trouble is that|D|Bmr028
fe008|you know i understand it in that context.|S|Bmr028
fe008|but it but it is almost resentful.|S|Bmr028
fe008|it's almost like you know resentful of the data resentful of the um the hard work that's going into preparing the data.|S|Bmr028
me011|well|D|Bmr028
fe008|is|D|Bmr028
me013|no no it has i don't think you're saying the data is cheating.|S|Bmr028
fe016|well it's it's|D|Bmr028
me013|i think you're saying in my experiment i cheated in this way.|S|Bmr028
me011|that's what i was saying.|S|Bmr028
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|i mean another is what liz was talking about how in the switchboard tests in all the switchboard tests we've been doing we've been making the same uh same uh uh standard using the same standard way of of getting the data to test on.|S|Bmr028
me013|which means that we weren't actually running it on on uh on data that had had no speech.|S|Bmr028
me013|and in a sense that was cheating.|S|Bmr028
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr028
me013|so so it it's it's a good wake up call if people well we have this performance but you have to keep in mind we're doing we're we're not doing the whole real task in this way and this way and this way.|S|Bmr028
me013|but i'll convince you that that it's still important for you to listen to what i have to say next because of this and this.|S|Bmr028
fe008|okay okay.|S|Bmr028
me013|and so it's just a way of putting it all out on the table uh as opposed to|D|Bmr028
me011|uh and it's used for a lot of different types of data.|S|Bmr028
me011|so whether you have segmentation or not is it male or female or not um do you know the signal to noise.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe008|huh.|B|Bmr028
me011|like that's another one i see all the time where you assume it's known.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah sure.|B|Bmr028
fe008|oh interesting.|B|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|and you say it's cheating because you don't actually compute it.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
fe008|i didn't know that.|S|Bmr028
fe008|huh!|S|Bmr028
me013|in|D|Bmr028
me013|in the multi band experiments in the first one we really wanted to find out what if you knew which band was really noisy.|S|Bmr028
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
me011|right.|B|Bmr028
me013|i mean suppose you just know that.|S|Bmr028
me011|same cheating.|S|Bmr028
me013|and then then even if you know that can that help you?|Q|Bmr028
me013|i mean what can what strategy can you do to do well without that particular band in the spectrum?|Q|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
me013|and so that was important to know as a baseline.|S|Bmr028
me013|and and then once you knew that then you go well now how do i know that that's noisy.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
fe008|okay.|B|Bmr028
me013|and and and uh|F|Bmr028
me013|but you know i i should also say that there's a lot of it's not just the word cheating but there's lots of other things that we talk about which as soon as you go outside of your narrow little group it gets very very confusing to people.|S|Bmr028
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
fe008|oh sure terminology is always context dependent.|S|Bmr028
me013|and|D|Bmr028
fe008|no question about it.|S|Bmr028
fe008|it's just that it seems like the the point without the negative evaluation would be.|S|Bmr028
fe008|however you know i understand your point that it it has a long tradition in this field.|S|Bmr028
me011|it's not even really negative.|S|Bmr028
fe008|i didn't realize.|S|Bmr028
fe008|and is used|D|Bmr028
fe008|this is interesting what what adam said about it being used also for a bunch of other uh dimensions.|S|Bmr028
me013|well the example i was thinking of also was this thing that that herve and and hynek and i made about uh increasing the error rate.|S|Bmr028
me013|and so we we did a number of papers and talks and so forth about uh uh the the virtues of increasing the error rate.|S|Bmr028
fe008|oh.|S|Bmr028
me013|okay.|S|Bmr028
me013|and i mean and the whole point of it was not that it was good to increase your error rate but it was good to be willing to risk increasing your error rate by trying risky things and trying because there's this notion of a local minimum that if you just have some system that's very complex|D|Bmr028
me013|and you you you turn some knobs to try to make it better and better you'll never get out of this local minimum.|S|Bmr028
me011|fine tune little bits.|S|Bmr028
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
me013|you have to be willing to jump to something that's quite different.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
fe008|interesting.|B|Bmr028
me013|and the first time you jump to something quite different or maybe the first ten times or a hundred times you do it's going to be much much worse.|S|Bmr028
me013|because you've optimized the other system.|S|Bmr028
me013|so the effect the immediate effect is going to be to increase your error rate.|S|Bmr028
fe008|interesting.|S|Bmr028
me013|and so it was we had a couple papers like towards increasing the error rate in speech and and so on.|S|Bmr028
me011|huh.|B|Bmr028
me013|and we really did get feedback from a few people some of whom were you know fairly senior that that um well you know you you you we're really concerned about you misleading people into thinking they should be increasing the error rate.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|and uh and we go we thought oh come on.|S|Bmr028
me013|but|F|Bmr028
me011|did you read the paper?|Q|Bmr028
mn017|but weren't you cheating in those experiments?|Q|Bmr028
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr028
me013|that's|D|Bmr028
me013|we weren't.|S|Bmr028
me013|that's why we increased the error rate.|S|Bmr028
fe008|interesting.|B|Bmr028
fe016|actually i think of cheating as a way to do some work where you can't address all of the computational tasks.|S|Bmr028
fe016|like if we want to study um speaker habits but we can't do speaker detection.|S|Bmr028
fe016|but we want to assume let's say we know this is jane and we know this is chuck.|S|Bmr028
fe016|even though automatically to look at the habits we would need to also first figure that out.|S|Bmr028
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
fe016|but we can sort of cheat on that factor.|S|Bmr028
fe016|because it's somebody else's research.|S|Bmr028
fe016|and then we just|D|Bmr028
fe016|so it's then we want to make a proof of concept for|D|Bmr028
me011|what what this|D|Bmr028
me011|right what would this be like if it were perfect?|Q|Bmr028
fe016|if someone else|D|Bmr028
me011|if this component were perfect.|S|Bmr028
fe016|right uh or but we really can't work on that problem.|S|Bmr028
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr028
fe016|we don't have time.|S|Bmr028
fe016|we're not interested or whatever.|S|Bmr028
me011|huh.|B|Bmr028
fe016|and so you you assume it's given.|S|Bmr028
me011|it's too hard usually.|S|Bmr028
fe016|because it's um you want to go forward with your research and assume that you have that information.|S|Bmr028
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
fe016|so|F|Bmr028
fe016|i guess if i don't ever think of it as negative more like it's something we're not building.|S|Bmr028
me011|it's not pejorative at all.|S|Bmr028
fe008|well the term itself is.|S|Bmr028
fe008|you know?|Q|Bmr028
me011|but it's not pejorative towards the data.|S|Bmr028
fe008|but but it and it's pejorative with respect to a certain purpose.|S|Bmr028
me011|it's pejorative towards|D|Bmr028
fe008|i understand.|S|Bmr028
me011|it's pejorative to ourselves.|S|Bmr028
fe008|i i wanted to raise the issue.|S|Bmr028
mn017|self|D|Bmr028
me011|right?|Q|Bmr028
me011|to say i am cheating in this experiment is not saying that the data is bad.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr028
fe008|yeah.|F|Bmr028
me013|but|D|Bmr028
me011|it's saying that my experiment is bad.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me013|anyway it's colloquial.|S|Bmr028
fe008|anyway.|S|Bmr028
me013|and and uh it's it's interesting to hear that that someone coming from a different direction it it sounds the way it sounds to you.|S|Bmr028
me013|but but uh i i'd never heard that before.|S|Bmr028
me011|yep.|B|Bmr028
fe008|okay that's interesting okay.|S|Bmr028
me013|so so so that's interesting.|S|Bmr028
fe008|well i wanted to raise the issue.|S|Bmr028
fe008|and um|F|Bmr028
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
fe008|i i uh i appreciate the discussion.|S|Bmr028
fe008|i wanted to ask one other question which is a different matter.|S|Bmr028
fe008|which is with respect to um this thing that you've been working on for the recording monitoring script.|S|Bmr028
fe008|so the idea you had this script that you're working on to be sure that the microphone values are in are kept in.|S|Bmr028
me011|oh right i haven't gotten back to that recently.|S|Bmr028
fe008|okay okay.|S|Bmr028
me011|but|F|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
me011|i assume you're saying you want me to get back to it.|S|Bmr028
fe008|because you know|D|Bmr028
fe008|well i was just wondering if|D|Bmr028
fe008|because i i am finding that um in double checking i've run across um one data set where the microphone was off early on.|S|Bmr028
fe008|and then two other speakers their microphones went off later.|S|Bmr028
me011|huh.|B|Bmr028
fe008|and this is out of like seven speakers.|S|Bmr028
fe008|so out of seven speakers four microphones you know basically three three microphones basically flaked.|S|Bmr028
fe008|which makes it hard for the data to be used for all possible purposes.|S|Bmr028
me018|do you think the battery ran out?|Q|Bmr028
fe008|that's what i think.|S|Bmr028
me018|or|D|Bmr028
fe008|i think the two that flaked late i think it was the battery.|S|Bmr028
fe008|but you know if the script could um you know alert the recording person to that|D|Bmr028
fe008|i mean i don't know if there's a way to replace a battery if it happens in the middle of a meeting.|S|Bmr028
me011|well|D|Bmr028
fe008|maybe that's hopeless anyway.|S|Bmr028
me011|well you can but you'll lose a lot of data.|S|Bmr028
fe008|but|D|Bmr028
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|but i mean that doesn't really help.|S|Bmr028
me011|because often the recording person isn't in the room.|S|Bmr028
fe008|oh i see.|S|Bmr028
me011|so what are you going to do?|Q|Bmr028
me011|i mean it will the person if you're looking up at the board and i disable the screensaver you will see that the mike is off.|S|Bmr028
me011|but that doesn't necessarily help.|S|Bmr028
fe008|okay then i guess that raises the question of uh whether we should screen the data before they get transcribed.|S|Bmr028
me011|so|F|Bmr028
fe008|because although i think that the data are still useful in terms of providing content.|S|Bmr028
fe008|and and that i know that having three out of seven microphones out of commission during some part of the meeting restricts the uh usefulness of the data for other purposes.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
fe016|i i think that's a really good idea.|S|Bmr028
fe008|and maybe you don't want to have it|D|Bmr028
fe016|because for all kinds of studies we don't really enjoy meetings where some of the where the signal's going off at times.|S|Bmr028
fe016|it just makes it hard to study any kind of parameters.|S|Bmr028
fe016|so|F|Bmr028
fe016|if there's a way to check the signal quality before transcribing it and you find any problem at all it'd be much better to go to another meeting i think.|S|Bmr028
fe008|i actually think that thilo's in a in a a you know when you do the pre segmenter and you and you run across troubles he he runs across some of these that are|D|Bmr028
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr028
mn014|yeah some of these things are captured by yeah um by looking at at the minimum and maximum and whatever.|S|Bmr028
fe008|so we have some part of that.|S|Bmr028
mn014|you find in the channels.|S|Bmr028
mn014|and|F|Bmr028
me011|it's just hard to tell between that and just someone not talking.|S|Bmr028
fe008|i|D|Bmr028
mn014|but|D|Bmr028
mn014|yep yep yeah yeah.|S|Bmr028
me011|so|F|Bmr028
fe008|well the and the other aspect of it is um that when the microphone is not well adjusted then even if it's not a lapel mike you can get lapel mike type behavior.|S|Bmr028
me011|right.|S|Bmr028
fe008|because i'm i'm expecting for example with this that you're going to end up you know picking up other peoples' signals.|S|Bmr028
fe016|i've already written some notes here.|S|Bmr028
fe016|so i|D|Bmr028
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
fe016|um right uh|B|Bmr028
fe008|yeah i mean it's just you know the microphone is intended for certain adjustments.|S|Bmr028
me011|well we should be getting new equipment in so we don't have to use the earplug any more.|S|Bmr028
fe016|okay.|B|Bmr028
fe016|but it's my ear.|S|Bmr028
fe016|i'm sure it's something wrong with my head.|S|Bmr028
me011|it's your hair.|S|Bmr028
mn014|huh.|B|Bmr028
fe016|but|F|Bmr028
fe016|um actually is there a way though to use whatever you're using for background noise to check post hoc that a microphone was constantly on?|Q|Bmr028
fe016|i mean|D|Bmr028
me011|i mean you you can do sort of a check.|S|Bmr028
fe016|uh like this|D|Bmr028
me011|but it will be very hard to tell the difference between that and um someone not talking.|S|Bmr028
me013|just so it doesn't when the microphone's dead it doesn't put out zeros?|Q|Bmr028
me011|no.|S|Bmr028
me013|or|D|Bmr028
me013|uhhuh.|S|Bmr028
mn017|what does it put out?|Q|Bmr028
me001|really?|Q|Bmr028
me013|johnson noise.|S|Bmr028
fe016|but then how are how are you detecting during a meeting?|Q|Bmr028
me011|little bit of noise.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|i use a threshold.|S|Bmr028
me011|if it's below a particular value it it flashes yellow.|S|Bmr028
me011|so as i uh but it's not perfect.|S|Bmr028
fe016|but is it better than nothing?|Q|Bmr028
me011|yeah probably.|S|Bmr028
fe016|because it would really be|D|Bmr028
me011|i mean this is the reason why i haven't gotten back to it is because my first pass at it didn't really work.|S|Bmr028
me011|because all the mikes have different noise levels.|S|Bmr028
fe016|right.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
me011|and so i have to do something a little more clever.|S|Bmr028
me001|it's just the noise from the connections and the everything.|S|Bmr028
fe016|but you could|D|Bmr028
me011|yep yep.|S|Bmr028
fe016|so you could run that post hoc on a already recorded meeting in the sense that you know not everyone as you just said you won't be there.|S|Bmr028
fe016|and then if we find any problems have the transcribers listen and|D|Bmr028
me011|yep.|B|Bmr028
fe016|i really think it's better not to transcribe a meeting that's going to have problems once you've spent all this effort.|S|Bmr028
me011|yep.|B|Bmr028
fe008|the only argument for doing so would be with reference to the content content maps.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah yeah.|S|Bmr028
fe008|uh but maybe then it should be done in the old original way.|S|Bmr028
fe008|instead of channelizing and having the uh uh you know elaborate coding of the backchannels.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
mn017|yeah you could still uh|D|Bmr028
me011|yeah there's uh the the standard deviation of the signal gives you a good clue.|S|Bmr028
me011|i mean if that is too low then you can be pretty sure that it's uh empty.|S|Bmr028
fe016|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
me001|huh.|B|Bmr028
mn014|yeah.|F|Bmr028
mn014|yeah sometimes you you capture that when you mix it together.|S|Bmr028
mn014|and|D|Bmr028
me011|right exactly.|S|Bmr028
mn014|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr028
fe008|and actually an an alternative to even doing that level of transcription would be to have a transcriber listen and and you know maybe just|D|Bmr028
fe008|oh i don't know if a uh|D|Bmr028
fe008|well someone who's associated with the meeting could have like a summary of points handled in the meeting.|S|Bmr028
fe008|you know maybe if we could pay one person who knows that subject matter to do an outline of the meeting's content.|S|Bmr028
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
fe008|instead of losing the content altogether.|S|Bmr028
mn017|well it's even if if you could still transcribe the words based on the far field microphone or something you could uh still use it for say language modeling.|S|Bmr028
me011|is there a|D|Bmr028
me011|far field.|S|Bmr028
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr028
mn017|you know.|S|Bmr028
fe008|i guess the trouble in my mind is that it that it's not a very neat corpus.|S|Bmr028
fe008|if you say these data are available.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr028
mn017|right.|B|Bmr028
fe008|but these are imperfect.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|F|Bmr028
fe008|because of the you know the batteries flaked.|S|Bmr028
me011|well we'll just we'll we'll just have to note those.|S|Bmr028
fe016|i'd we're i'd much rather have you know meetings that have all the channels.|S|Bmr028
fe016|even if we had to skip a meeting or something.|S|Bmr028
mn017|well if|D|Bmr028
mn017|right.|B|Bmr028
fe016|just for all these other purposes.|S|Bmr028
fe016|so|F|Bmr028
fe008|and we have so many.|S|Bmr028
mn017|i guess there is no|D|Bmr028
me001|you could put them at the back of the queue or something.|S|Bmr028
me011|well i i i think we can't throw away that data.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|because otherwise we'll end up with very few meetings.|S|Bmr028
fe016|right but just|D|Bmr028
mn017|there's there's no shortage of meetings.|S|Bmr028
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|but|F|Bmr028
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr028
mn017|so|F|Bmr028
fe016|right there but there's a shortage of transcription power.|S|Bmr028
mn017|we can afford we can|D|Bmr028
fe008|we have such a backlog i mean to be able to get through the backlog of the of the good meetings it would be nice to not have energies diverted.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr028
me011|do we have a|D|Bmr028
me011|i'm sorry for interrupting.|S|Bmr028
me011|do we have an e d u meeting at four?|Q|Bmr028
fe008|that's fine.|S|Bmr028
mn017|huh|F|Bmr028
fe008|oh good question.|S|Bmr028
fe016|you know what?|Q|Bmr028
fe016|they their four o'clock cancelled.|S|Bmr028
mn014|i don't think so.|S|Bmr028
fe016|and they're starting at four twenty.|S|Bmr028
fe016|and i'll set up at four fifteen.|S|Bmr028
me011|okay great.|S|Bmr028
me011|good.|S|Bmr028
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
mn017|huh hey i bet there's tea.|S|Bmr028
me013|yeah but there's|D|Bmr028
me011|because otherwise i was going to say we have to cancel.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr028
me013|there's tea also though.|S|Bmr028
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr028
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr028
fe016|yeah so you'll have|D|Bmr028
me013|so maybe we should maybe we should do a uh simultaneous digits digits read in the interest of of getting the snacks.|S|Bmr028
me011|a simultaneous digit okay.|S|Bmr028
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr028
mn017|hey i've never done one of those.|S|Bmr028
me013|oh you never have?|S|Bmr028
me013|oh it's a treat.|S|Bmr028
fe016|you have to plug your ears or just prepare not to laugh.|S|Bmr028
mn017|right.|S|Bmr028
