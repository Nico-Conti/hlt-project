me018|okay.|S|Bro021
me013|uh|F|Bro021
me013|somebody else should run this.|S|Bro021
me013|i'm sick of being the one to sort of go through and say well what do you think about this.|S|Bro021
me013|you want to|D|Bro021
me018|should we take turns?|Q|Bro021
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro021
me018|you want me to run it today?|Q|Bro021
me013|yeah why don't you run it today.|S|Bro021
me018|okay.|S|Bro021
me013|okay.|S|Bro021
me018|okay.|F|Bro021
me018|um|F|Bro021
me018|let's see maybe we should just get a list of items.|S|Bro021
me018|things that we should talk about.|S|Bro021
me018|um|F|Bro021
me018|i guess there's the usual updates.|S|Bro021
me018|everybody going around and saying uh you know what they're working on.|S|Bro021
me018|the things that happened the last week.|S|Bro021
me018|but aside from that is there anything in particular that anybody wants to bring up?|Q|Bro021
mn052|huh.|B|Bro021
me018|for today.|S|Bro021
me018|no.|S|Bro021
me018|okay.|S|Bro021
me018|so why don't we just around and people can give updates.|S|Bro021
fn002|oh.|B|Bro021
me018|uh do you want to start stephane?|Q|Bro021
mn007|all right.|S|Bro021
mn007|um|F|Bro021
mn007|well the first thing maybe is that the eurospeech paper is uh accepted.|S|Bro021
mn007|um|F|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro021
me018|this is what what do you uh what's in the paper there?|Q|Bro021
mn007|so it's the paper that describe basically the um system that were proposed for the aurora.|S|Bro021
me018|the one that we we submitted the last round?|Q|Bro021
mn007|right yeah.|S|Bro021
me018|uhhuh.|S|Bro021
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro021
mn007|um yeah.|F|Bro021
mn007|so and the fff comments seems from the reviewer are good.|S|Bro021
mn007|so|F|Bro021
me018|huh.|B|Bro021
mn007|huh|F|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro021
me018|where where's it going to be this year?|Q|Bro021
mn007|it's uh aalborg in denmark.|S|Bro021
me018|oh okay.|S|Bro021
mn007|and it's|D|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro021
mn007|september.|S|Bro021
me018|huh.|B|Bro021
mn007|huh|F|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro021
mn007|then uh whhh|D|Bro021
mn007|well i've been working on on mainly on on line normalization this week.|S|Bro021
mn007|uh i've been trying different slightly slightly different approaches.|S|Bro021
mn007|um the first thing is trying to play a little bit again with the um time constant.|S|Bro021
mn007|uh second thing is uh the training of uh on line normalization with two different means.|S|Bro021
mn007|one mean for the silence and one for the speech.|S|Bro021
mn007|um|F|Bro021
mn007|and so i have two recursions which are controlled by the um probability of the voice activity detector.|S|Bro021
mn007|huh|F|Bro021
mn007|this actually don't doesn't seem to help.|S|Bro021
mn007|although it doesn't hurt.|S|Bro021
mn007|so|F|Bro021
mn007|but well both on line normalization approach seems equivalent.|S|Bro021
me018|are the means pretty different for the two?|Q|Bro021
mn007|well they|D|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro021
mn007|they can be very different.|S|Bro021
mn007|yeah uhhuh|F|Bro021
me018|huh?|Q|Bro021
me013|so do you maybe make errors in different places?|Q|Bro021
me013|different kinds of errors.|S|Bro021
mn007|i didn't look uh more closely.|S|Bro021
mn007|um it might be yeah.|S|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro021
mn007|um|F|Bro021
mn007|well uh there is one thing that we can observe is that the mean are more different for for c zero and c one than for the other coefficients.|S|Bro021
mn007|and|F|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro021
mn007|and yeah it the c one is|D|Bro021
mn007|there are strange strange thing happening with c one is that when you have different kind of noises the mean for the the silence portion is can be different.|S|Bro021
me018|huh.|B|Bro021
mn007|and|F|Bro021
mn007|so when you look at the trajectory of c one it's has a strange shape.|S|Bro021
mn007|and|F|Bro021
mn007|i was expecting the that these two mean helps.|S|Bro021
mn007|especially because of the the strange c c one shape.|S|Bro021
mn007|uh which can like you can have um a trajectory for the speech.|S|Bro021
mn007|and then when you are in the silence it goes somewhere.|S|Bro021
mn007|but if the noise is different it goes somewhere else.|S|Bro021
me018|oh.|S|Bro021
mn007|so which would mean that if we estimate the mean based on all the signal even though we have frame dropping but we don't frame uh drop everything.|S|Bro021
mn007|but uh this can hurts the estimation of the mean for speech.|S|Bro021
mn007|and|F|Bro021
mn007|huh but i still have to investigate further i think.|S|Bro021
mn007|um a third thing is um that instead of having a fixed time constant i try to have a time constant that's smaller at the beginning of the utterances.|S|Bro021
mn007|to adapt more quickly to the something that's closer to the right mean.|S|Bro021
mn007|um|F|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro021
mn007|and then this time constant increases.|S|Bro021
mn007|and i have a threshold that|D|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn007|well if it's higher than a certain threshold i keep it to this threshold to still uh adapt um the mean when if the utterance is uh long enough to to continue to adapt after like one second.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn007|or|F|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn007|huh|F|Bro021
mn007|uh well this doesn't help neither.|S|Bro021
mn007|but this doesn't hurt.|S|Bro021
mn007|so well.|F|Bro021
mn007|it seems pretty|D|Bro021
me018|wasn't there some experiment you were going to try?|Q|Bro021
me018|where you did something differently for each um uh i don't know whether it was each mel band or each uh um f f t bin or|D|Bro021
me018|there was something you were going to uh some parameter you were going to vary depending on the frequency.|S|Bro021
me018|i don't know if that was|D|Bro021
mn007|i guess it was|D|Bro021
mn007|i don't know.|S|Bro021
mn007|no.|S|Bro021
mn007|maybe it's this this idea of having different on line normalization um tunings for the different m f c c's.|S|Bro021
me018|for each uh|D|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn007|but|F|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me018|yeah.|F|Bro021
me018|i i thought morgan you brought it up a couple meetings ago.|S|Bro021
me018|and then it was something about uh|D|Bro021
me018|and then somebody said yeah it does seem like you know c zero is the one that's you know the major one or uh|D|Bro021
me018|i can't remember exactly what it was now.|S|Bro021
mn007|huh.|B|Bro021
mn007|yeah there|D|Bro021
mn007|uh actually yeah.|S|Bro021
mn007|um it's very important to normalize c zero.|S|Bro021
mn007|and much less to normalize the other coefficients.|S|Bro021
mn007|and um|F|Bro021
mn007|uh well at least with the current on line normalization scheme.|S|Bro021
mn007|and|F|Bro021
mn007|we i think we kind of know that normalizing c one doesn't help with the current scheme.|S|Bro021
mn007|and|F|Bro021
mn007|and yeah.|F|Bro021
mn007|in my idea i i was thinking that the the the reason is maybe because of these funny things that happen between speech and silence which have different means.|S|Bro021
mn007|um|F|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro021
mn007|but maybe it's not so so easy to|D|Bro021
me013|um|F|Bro021
me013|i really would like to suggest looking um a little bit at the kinds of errors.|S|Bro021
me013|i know you can get lost in that and go forever and not see too much but sometimes.|S|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me013|but but um|F|Bro021
me013|just seeing that each of these things didn't make things better may not be enough.|S|Bro021
me013|it may be that they're making them better in some ways and worse in others.|S|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me013|or increasing insertions and decreasing deletions.|S|Bro021
me013|or|F|Bro021
me013|or um|F|Bro021
me013|um|F|Bro021
me013|you know helping with noisy case.|S|Bro021
me013|but hurting in quiet case.|S|Bro021
me013|and if you saw that then maybe you it would something would occur to you of how to deal with that.|S|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn052|huh.|B|Bro021
mn007|all right.|S|Bro021
mn007|huh.|B|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro021
mn007|um|F|Bro021
mn007|so that's it i think for the on line normalization.|S|Bro021
mn007|um|F|Bro021
mn007|yeah i've been playing a little bit with some kind of thresholding.|S|Bro021
mn007|and|F|Bro021
mn007|huh|F|Bro021
mn007|as a first experiment i think|D|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro021
mn007|well what i did is is to take um to measure the average|D|Bro021
mn007|no the maximum energy of each utterance.|S|Bro021
mn007|and then put a threshold|D|Bro021
mn007|well this for each mel band.|S|Bro021
mn007|then put a threshold that's fifteen d b below|D|Bro021
mn007|well uh a couple of d b below this maximum.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me013|huh.|B|Bro021
mn007|and|F|Bro021
mn007|actually it was not a threshold.|S|Bro021
mn007|it was just adding noise.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn007|so i was adding a white noise energy.|S|Bro021
mn007|uh that's fifteen d b below the maximum energy of the utterance.|S|Bro021
mn007|and|F|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro021
mn007|when we look at at the um m f c c that result from this they are a lot more smoother.|S|Bro021
mn007|um|F|Bro021
mn007|when we compare like a channel zero and channel one utterance|D|Bro021
mn007|um so a clean and uh the same noisy utterance.|S|Bro021
mn007|well there is almost no difference between the cepstral coefficients of the two.|S|Bro021
me018|huh?|Q|Bro021
mn007|um|F|Bro021
mn007|and yeah.|S|Bro021
mn007|and the result that we have in term of speech recognition actually it's not it's not worse.|S|Bro021
mn007|it's not better neither.|S|Bro021
me018|huh.|B|Bro021
mn007|but it's um kind of surprising that it's not worse.|S|Bro021
mn007|because basically you add noise that's fifteen d b just fifteen d b below the maximum energy.|S|Bro021
me006|sorry.|S|Bro021
mn007|and|D|Bro021
me018|so why does that smooth things out?|Q|Bro021
mn007|at least|D|Bro021
me018|i don't i don't understand that.|S|Bro021
me013|well there's less difference right?|S|Bro021
mn007|it's i think it's whitening this the portion that are more silent.|S|Bro021
me013|because it's|D|Bro021
mn007|as you add a white noise that are has a very high energy it whitens everything.|S|Bro021
me018|huh oh okay.|S|Bro021
mn007|and|F|Bro021
mn007|and the high energy portion of the speech don't get much affected anyway by the other noise.|S|Bro021
mn007|and as the noise you add is the same is the shape it's also the same.|S|Bro021
me018|huh?|Q|Bro021
me013|yeah.|B|Bro021
mn007|so they have the trajectory are very very similar.|S|Bro021
mn007|and and|F|Bro021
me013|so i mean again if you trained in one kind of noise and tested in the same kind of noise you'd you know given enough training data you don't do do badly.|S|Bro021
me013|the reason that we that we have the problems we have is because it's different in training and test.|S|Bro021
me013|even if the general kind is the same the exact instances are different.|S|Bro021
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me013|and and|F|Bro021
me013|so when you whiten it then it's like you the the only noise to to first order the only noise that you have is white noise.|S|Bro021
me013|and you've added the same thing to training and test.|S|Bro021
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me013|so it's|D|Bro021
me018|huh?|Q|Bro021
me013|uh|F|Bro021
me018|so would that be similar to like doing the smoothing then over time?|Q|Bro021
me018|or|D|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me013|well it's a kind of smoothing.|S|Bro021
mn007|i think it's i think it's different.|S|Bro021
me013|but|D|Bro021
mn007|it's it's something that yeah that affects more or less the silence portions.|S|Bro021
mn007|because|D|Bro021
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn007|well anyway the the portion of speech that have high energy are not a lot affected by the noises in the aurora database.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn007|if if you compare the two shut channels of speechdat car during speech portion it's the m f c c are not very different.|S|Bro021
mn007|they are very different when energy's lower.|S|Bro021
mn007|like during fricatives or during speech pauses.|S|Bro021
mn007|and|F|Bro021
mn007|uh|F|Bro021
me013|yeah but you're still getting more recognition errors.|S|Bro021
me013|which means that the differences even though they look like they're not so big are are hurting your recognition.|S|Bro021
me013|right?|Q|Bro021
mn007|yeah so it distort the speech.|S|Bro021
mn007|right.|S|Bro021
mn007|um|F|Bro021
me013|yeah.|S|Bro021
me018|so performance went down?|Q|Bro021
mn007|no.|S|Bro021
mn007|it didn't.|S|Bro021
me018|oh.|S|Bro021
mn007|but|D|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro021
mn007|so but in this case i i really expect that maybe the the two these two stream of features they are very different.|S|Bro021
mn007|i mean and maybe we could gain something by combining them.|S|Bro021
me013|well the other thing is that you just picked one particular way of doing it.|S|Bro021
mn007|or|F|Bro021
me013|uh i mean first place it's fifteen d b uh down across the utterance.|S|Bro021
me013|and maybe you'd want to have something that was a little more adaptive.|S|Bro021
me013|secondly you happened to pick fifteen d b.|S|Bro021
mn007|huh.|B|Bro021
me013|and maybe twenty would be better.|S|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro021
me013|or or twelve.|S|Bro021
mn007|yeah right.|S|Bro021
me018|so what was the what was the threshold part of it?|Q|Bro021
me018|was the threshold uh how far down?|Q|Bro021
me013|yeah.|S|Bro021
me013|well he yeah he had to figure out how much to add.|S|Bro021
me013|so he was looking he was looking at the peak value.|S|Bro021
me018|uhhuh.|S|Bro021
me013|right?|Q|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro021
me013|and then|D|Bro021
me018|and and so what's|D|Bro021
me018|i don't understand.|S|Bro021
me018|how does it go?|Q|Bro021
me018|if it if if the peak value's above some threshold then you add the noise?|Q|Bro021
me018|or if it's below|D|Bro021
mn007|i systematically add the noise.|S|Bro021
mn007|but the um noise level is just some kind of threshold below the peak.|S|Bro021
me018|oh oh i see.|S|Bro021
mn007|huh|F|Bro021
me018|i see.|S|Bro021
mn007|um|F|Bro021
me013|yeah.|B|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro021
mn007|which is not really noise actually.|S|Bro021
mn007|it's just adding a constant to each of the mel uh energy.|S|Bro021
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn007|to each of the mel filter bank.|S|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro021
me018|i see.|S|Bro021
mn007|so yeah it's really uh white noise.|S|Bro021
mn007|i|D|Bro021
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me013|yeah.|B|Bro021
me013|so then afterwards a log is taken.|S|Bro021
me013|and that's sort of why the the little variation tends to go away.|S|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn007|um|F|Bro021
mn007|yeah so|D|Bro021
mn007|well the this threshold is still a factor that we have to look at.|S|Bro021
mn007|and i don't know maybe a constant noise addition would would be fine also.|S|Bro021
mn007|or|F|Bro021
mn007|um|F|Bro021
me013|or or not constant but but uh varying over time in fact is another way to go.|S|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me013|um|F|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro021
mn007|um|F|Bro021
me013|were you using the the normalization in addition to this?|Q|Bro021
me013|i mean what was the rest of the system?|Q|Bro021
mn007|um|F|Bro021
mn007|yeah it was it was uh the same system.|S|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|F|Bro021
me013|okay.|B|Bro021
mn007|it was the same system.|S|Bro021
mn007|huh|F|Bro021
mn007|oh yeah.|F|Bro021
mn007|a third thing is that um i play a little bit with the um finding what was different between um|D|Bro021
mn007|and there were a couple of differences.|S|Bro021
mn007|like the l d a filters were not the same.|S|Bro021
mn007|um|F|Bro021
mn007|he had the france telecom blind equalization in the system.|S|Bro021
mn007|um|F|Bro021
mn007|the number of m f c c that was were used was different.|S|Bro021
mn007|you used thirteen.|S|Bro021
mn007|and we used fifteen.|S|Bro021
mn007|well a bunch of differences.|S|Bro021
mn007|and um actually the result that he he got were much better on t i digits especially.|S|Bro021
mn007|so i'm kind of investigated to see what was the main factor for this difference.|S|Bro021
mn007|and it seems that the l d a filter is is was hurting.|S|Bro021
mn007|um so when we put some noise compensation the um l d a filter that that's derived from noisy speech is not more anymore optimal.|S|Bro021
mn007|and it makes a big difference um on t i digits.|S|Bro021
mn007|trained on clean.|S|Bro021
mn007|uh if we use the the old l d a filter i mean the l d a filter that was in the proposal we have like eighty two point seven percent recognition rate.|S|Bro021
mn007|um|F|Bro021
mn007|on noisy speech when the system is trained on clean speech.|S|Bro021
mn007|but|F|Bro021
mn007|and when we use the filter that's derived from clean speech we jumped.|S|Bro021
mn007|so from eighty two point seven to eighty five point one.|S|Bro021
mn007|which is a huge leap.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn007|um|F|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro021
mn007|so now the results are more similar.|S|Bro021
mn007|and|F|Bro021
mn007|i don't i will not i think investigate on the other differences.|S|Bro021
mn007|which is like the number of m f c c that we keep and other small things.|S|Bro021
mn007|that we can i think optimize later on anyway.|S|Bro021
me013|sure.|S|Bro021
me013|but on the other hand if everybody is trying different kinds of noise suppression things and so forth it might be good to standardize on the piece that we're not changing.|S|Bro021
me013|right?|Q|Bro021
me013|so if there's any particular reason to pick one or the other|D|Bro021
me013|i mean|F|Bro021
me013|which which one is closer to what the proposal was that was submitted to aurora?|Q|Bro021
me013|are they|D|Bro021
me013|they both|D|Bro021
me013|well i mean|D|Bro021
mn007|i think|D|Bro021
mn007|yeah i think uh the new system that i tested is i guess closer.|S|Bro021
mn007|because it doesn't have it have less of of france telecom stuff.|S|Bro021
mn052|you mean the|D|Bro021
mn007|i|D|Bro021
mn052|the whatever you uh tested with recently right?|S|Bro021
mn007|huh?|D|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro021
mn052|yeah?|Q|Bro021
me013|well no i i'm i|D|Bro021
me013|yeah you're trying to add in france telecom.|S|Bro021
mn007|but we|D|Bro021
me013|tell them about the rest of it.|S|Bro021
me013|like you said the number of filters might be different or something.|S|Bro021
me013|right?|Q|Bro021
mn052|the number of cepstral coefficients is what?|Q|Bro021
me013|or|F|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro021
me013|yeah.|F|Bro021
me013|so i mean i think we'd want to standardize there.|S|Bro021
me013|wouldn't we?|Q|Bro021
mn007|yeah yeah.|S|Bro021
me013|so you guys should pick something.|S|Bro021
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro021
me013|and|F|Bro021
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro021
me013|well all all three of you.|S|Bro021
mn007|i think we were going to work with with this or this new system.|S|Bro021
mn007|or with|D|Bro021
mn052|uh so the the right now the the system that is there in the what we have in the repositories with uses fifteen.|S|Bro021
mn007|so|F|Bro021
mn007|right.|S|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro021
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro021
mn052|so yeah.|S|Bro021
mn052|so yep.|S|Bro021
mn007|but we will use the the l d a filters derived from clean speech.|S|Bro021
mn052|yeah yeah.|B|Bro021
mn007|well yeah actually it's it's not the the l d a filter.|S|Bro021
mn052|so|F|Bro021
mn007|it's something that's also short enough in in latency.|S|Bro021
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro021
mn052|well.|B|Bro021
mn007|so|F|Bro021
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro021
mn052|so we haven't we have been always using uh fifteen coefficients.|S|Bro021
mn052|not thirteen.|S|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn052|yeah.|F|Bro021
mn052|well uh that's something's|D|Bro021
mn052|um|F|Bro021
mn052|yeah.|F|Bro021
mn052|then|D|Bro021
mn052|huh|F|Bro021
me013|i think as long as you guys agree on it it doesn't matter.|S|Bro021
me013|i think we have a maximum of sixty uh features that we're allowed.|S|Bro021
me013|so|F|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro021
mn052|yeah maybe we can i mean at least|D|Bro021
mn052|um i'll run some experiments to see whether once i have this noise compensation to see whether thirteen and fifteen really matters or not.|S|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn052|never tested it with the compensation.|S|Bro021
mn052|but without uh compensation it was like fifteen was slightly better than thirteen.|S|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro021
mn052|so that's why we stuck to thirteen.|S|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro021
mn007|and there is there is also this log energy versus c zero.|S|Bro021
mn052|sorry.|S|Bro021
mn052|fifteen.|S|Bro021
mn052|yeah the log energy versus c zero.|S|Bro021
mn007|well.|F|Bro021
mn052|uh that's that's the other thing.|S|Bro021
mn007|if if|D|Bro021
mn052|i mean without noise compensation certainly c zero is better than log energy.|S|Bro021
mn052|i mean because the there are more uh mismatched conditions than the matching conditions for testing.|S|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn052|you know.|F|Bro021
mn052|always for the matched condition you always get a slightly better performance for log energy than c zero.|S|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn052|but not for|D|Bro021
mn052|i mean for matched and the clean condition both you get log energy.|S|Bro021
mn052|i mean you get a better performance with log energy.|S|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn052|well um maybe once we have this noise compensation i don't know we have to try that also whether we want to go for c zero or log energy.|S|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn052|we can see that.|S|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro021
mn052|huh|F|Bro021
mn007|huh.|B|Bro021
me018|so do you have more stephane?|Q|Bro021
me018|or|D|Bro021
mn007|uh that's it i think.|S|Bro021
mn007|huh|F|Bro021
me018|do you have anything morgan?|Q|Bro021
me018|or|D|Bro021
me013|uh|F|Bro021
me013|no i'm just you know being a manager this week.|S|Bro021
me013|so|F|Bro021
me018|how about you barry?|Q|Bro021
me006|um still working on my my quals preparation stuff.|S|Bro021
me006|um so i'm i'm thinking about um starting some uh cheating experiments to uh determine the um the relative effectiveness of um some intermediate categories that i want to classify.|S|Bro021
me006|so for example um if i know where voicing occurs and everything um i would do a phone um phone recognition experiment.|S|Bro021
me006|um somehow putting in the the uh the perfect knowledge that i have about voicing.|S|Bro021
me006|so um in particular i was thinking um in in the hybrid framework just taking those l n a files and um setting to zero those probabilities that um that these phones are not voicing.|S|Bro021
me006|so say like i know this particular segment is voicing.|S|Bro021
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me006|um i would say uh go into the corresponding l n a file and zonk out the the posteriors for um those phonemes that um are not voiced.|S|Bro021
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me006|and then see what kinds of improvements i get.|S|Bro021
me018|huh?|Q|Bro021
me006|and so this would be a useful thing um to know in terms of like which which um which of these categories are are good for um speech recognition.|S|Bro021
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me006|so that's|D|Bro021
me006|i hope to get those uh those experiments done by by the time quals come come around in july.|S|Bro021
me018|so do you just take the probabilities of the other ones and spread them out evenly among the the remaining ones?|Q|Bro021
me006|yeah.|S|Bro021
me006|i i i was thinking|D|Bro021
me006|okay so just set to set to some really low number the the non voiced um phones.|S|Bro021
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me006|right?|Q|Bro021
me006|and then renormalize.|S|Bro021
me018|huh.|B|Bro021
me006|right.|S|Bro021
me018|cool.|S|Bro021
mn052|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me006|yeah.|B|Bro021
me018|that will be really interesting to see.|S|Bro021
me018|you know?|Q|Bro021
me018|so then you're going to feed the those into some standard recognizer?|Q|Bro021
me006|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me018|uh are you going to do digits?|Q|Bro021
me006|yeah.|S|Bro021
me018|or|D|Bro021
me006|um well i'm going to work with timit.|S|Bro021
me018|with timit okay.|S|Bro021
me006|timit uh phone recognition with timit.|S|Bro021
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me006|and um|F|Bro021
me018|oh so then you'll feed those|D|Bro021
me018|sorry.|S|Bro021
me018|so where do the outputs of the net go into if you're doing phone recognition?|Q|Bro021
me006|oh.|S|Bro021
me006|um the outputs of the net go into the standard um icsi hybrid um recognizer.|S|Bro021
me006|so maybe um chronos.|S|Bro021
me018|and you're going to the you're going to do phone recognition with that?|Q|Bro021
me006|or|D|Bro021
me006|phone recognition.|S|Bro021
me018|okay okay.|S|Bro021
me006|right right.|S|Bro021
me018|i see.|S|Bro021
me006|so|F|Bro021
me006|and uh another thing would be to extend this to uh digits or something where i can look at whole words.|S|Bro021
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me006|and i would be able to see uh not just like phoneme events but um inter phoneme events.|S|Bro021
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me006|so like this is from a stop to to a a vocalic.|S|Bro021
me006|segment.|S|Bro021
me006|you know?|Q|Bro021
me006|something that is transitional in nature.|S|Bro021
me018|right.|B|Bro021
me018|cool.|S|Bro021
me006|yeah.|F|Bro021
me018|great.|S|Bro021
me018|uh|F|Bro021
me006|so that's that's it.|S|Bro021
me018|okay.|S|Bro021
me018|um|F|Bro021
me006|yeah.|B|Bro021
me018|let's see i haven't done a whole lot on anything related to this this week.|S|Bro021
me018|i've been focusing mainly on meeting recorder stuff.|S|Bro021
mn007|oh.|B|Bro021
me018|so um i guess i'll just pass it on to dave.|S|Bro021
me026|uh okay.|S|Bro021
me026|well in my lunch talk last week i i said i'd tried phase normalization and gotten garbage results using that um long term mean subtraction approach.|S|Bro021
me026|it turned out there was a bug in my matlab code.|S|Bro021
me026|so i tried it again.|S|Bro021
me026|um|F|Bro021
me026|and um the results were were better.|S|Bro021
me026|i got intelligible speech back.|S|Bro021
me026|but they still weren't as good as just subtracting the magnitude the log magnitude means.|S|Bro021
me026|and also i've been talking to um andreas and thilo about the um smartkom language model.|S|Bro021
me026|and about coming up with a good model for um far mike use of the smartkom system.|S|Bro021
me026|so|F|Bro021
me026|i'm going to be working on um implementing this mean subtraction approach in the far mike system.|S|Bro021
me026|for the smartkom system i mean.|S|Bro021
me026|and um|F|Bro021
me026|one of the experiments we're going to do is um we're going to um train the a broadcast news net.|S|Bro021
me026|which is because that's what we've been using so far.|S|Bro021
me026|and um adapt it on some other data um andreas wants to use.|S|Bro021
me026|um|F|Bro021
me026|data that resembles read speech.|S|Bro021
me026|like these digit readings.|S|Bro021
me026|because he feels that the smartkom system interaction is not going to be exactly conversational.|S|Bro021
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me026|so actually i was wondering how long does it take to train that broadcast news net?|Q|Bro021
me013|the big one takes a while.|S|Bro021
me013|yeah that takes two three weeks.|S|Bro021
me026|two three weeks.|S|Bro021
me013|so but you know uh you can get|D|Bro021
me013|i don't know if you even want to run the big one uh um in the in the final system.|S|Bro021
me013|because you know it takes a little while to run it.|S|Bro021
me013|so um you can scale it down by|D|Bro021
me013|i'm sorry.|S|Bro021
me013|it was two three weeks for training up for the large broadcast news test set training set.|S|Bro021
me026|oh.|B|Bro021
me013|i don't know how much you'd be training on.|S|Bro021
me026|okay.|S|Bro021
me013|the full.|S|Bro021
me013|uh so if you trained on half as much and made the net uh uh half as big then it would be one fourth the amount of time.|S|Bro021
me026|okay.|B|Bro021
me013|and it'd be nearly as good.|S|Bro021
me013|so|F|Bro021
me026|okay.|B|Bro021
me013|yeah.|F|Bro021
me013|also i guess we had we've had these uh little discussions.|S|Bro021
me013|i guess you haven't had a chance to work with it too much.|S|Bro021
me013|about about uh uh uh other ways of taking care of the phase.|S|Bro021
me026|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me013|so i mean i i guess that was something i could say would be that we've talked a little bit about.|S|Bro021
me013|you just doing it all with complex arithmetic.|S|Bro021
me013|and uh|F|Bro021
me013|and not not uh doing the polar representation with magnitude and phase.|S|Bro021
me013|but it looks like there's ways that one could potentially just work with the complex numbers and and and in principle get rid of the effects of the average complex spectrum.|S|Bro021
me013|but|D|Bro021
me026|and um|F|Bro021
me026|actually regarding the phase normalization|D|Bro021
me026|so i did two experiments.|S|Bro021
me026|and one is|D|Bro021
me026|so phases get added modulo two pi.|S|Bro021
me026|and because you only know the phase of the complex number to a value modulo two pi.|S|Bro021
me026|and so i thought at first um that uh what i should do is unwrap the phase.|S|Bro021
me026|because that will undo that.|S|Bro021
me026|um but i actually got worse results doing that unwrapping using the simple phase unwrapper that's in matlab than i did not unwrapping at all.|S|Bro021
me018|huh?|Q|Bro021
mn052|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me013|yeah.|B|Bro021
me013|so.|B|Bro021
me026|and that's all i have to say.|S|Bro021
me018|huh.|B|Bro021
me013|yeah.|B|Bro021
me013|so i'm i'm still hopeful that that|D|Bro021
me013|i mean we we don't even know if the phase is something the average phase is something that we do want to remove.|S|Bro021
me013|i mean maybe there's some deeper reason why it isn't the right thing to do.|S|Bro021
me013|but um|F|Bro021
me013|at least in principle it looks like there's there's uh a couple potential ways to do it.|S|Bro021
me013|one one being to just work with the complex numbers.|S|Bro021
me013|um|F|Bro021
me013|and uh in rectangular kind of coordinates.|S|Bro021
me013|and the other is to uh do a taylor series.|S|Bro021
me013|well.|F|Bro021
me013|so you work with the complex numbers.|S|Bro021
me013|and then when you get the spectrum the average complex spectrum um actually divide it out.|S|Bro021
me013|um as opposed to taking the log and subtracting.|S|Bro021
me013|so then|D|Bro021
me013|um|F|Bro021
me013|um|F|Bro021
me013|you know there might be some numerical issues.|S|Bro021
me013|we don't really know that.|S|Bro021
me013|the other thing we talked a little bit about was taylor series expansion.|S|Bro021
me013|and um|F|Bro021
me013|uh actually i was talking to dick karp about it a little bit.|S|Bro021
me013|and and and since i got thinking about it.|S|Bro021
me013|and and uh|F|Bro021
me013|so one thing is that you'd have to do i think|D|Bro021
me013|uh|F|Bro021
me013|we may have to do this on a whiteboard.|S|Bro021
me013|but i think you have to be a little careful about scaling the numbers that you're taking the complex numbers that you're taking the log of.|S|Bro021
me013|because the taylor expansion for it has you know a square and a cube and and so forth.|S|Bro021
me013|and and so if if you have a a number that is modulus you know uh very different from one it should be right around one.|S|Bro021
me013|if it's|D|Bro021
me013|because it's a expansion of log one.|S|Bro021
me013|one minus epsilon.|S|Bro021
me013|or is is one plus epsilon.|S|Bro021
me013|or is it one plus|D|Bro021
me013|well there's an epsilon squared over two.|S|Bro021
me026|okay.|B|Bro021
me013|and an epsilon cubed over three.|S|Bro021
me013|and so forth.|S|Bro021
me013|so if epsilon is bigger than one then it diverges.|S|Bro021
me026|oh.|B|Bro021
me013|so you have to do some scaling.|S|Bro021
me013|but that's not a big deal.|S|Bro021
me013|because it's the log of of k times a complex number.|S|Bro021
me013|then you can just that's the same as log of k plus log of the complex number.|S|Bro021
me026|oh.|B|Bro021
me026|okay.|B|Bro021
me013|uh|F|Bro021
me013|so there's|D|Bro021
me013|converges.|S|Bro021
me013|but|F|Bro021
me018|huh.|B|Bro021
me018|okay.|S|Bro021
me018|how about you sunil?|Q|Bro021
mn052|so um i've been uh implementing this uh wiener filtering for this aurora task.|S|Bro021
mn052|and uh|F|Bro021
mn052|i i actually thought it was it was doing fine when i tested it once.|S|Bro021
mn052|it's like using a small section of the code.|S|Bro021
mn052|and then i ran the whole recognition experiment with italian.|S|Bro021
mn052|and i got like worse results than not using it.|S|Bro021
mn052|then i|D|Bro021
mn052|so i've been trying to find where the problem came from.|S|Bro021
mn052|and then it looks like i have some problem in the way.|S|Bro021
mn052|there is some some very silly bug somewhere.|S|Bro021
mn052|and ugh!|S|Bro021
mn052|i i mean uh it actually it actually made the whole thing worse.|S|Bro021
mn052|i was looking at the spectrograms that i got.|S|Bro021
mn052|and it's like it's it's very horrible.|S|Bro021
mn052|like when i|D|Bro021
me013|i i missed the|D|Bro021
me013|i'm sorry.|S|Bro021
me013|i was i was distracted.|S|Bro021
me013|i missed the very first sentence.|S|Bro021
me013|so then i'm a little lost on the rest.|S|Bro021
mn052|oh i mean|D|Bro021
me013|what what what|D|Bro021
mn052|oh yeah.|S|Bro021
mn052|i actually implemented the wiener filtering as a module and then tested it out separately.|S|Bro021
me013|yeah i see.|S|Bro021
me013|oh okay.|S|Bro021
mn052|and it it it gave like i just got the signal out.|S|Bro021
mn052|and it it was okay.|S|Bro021
mn052|so i plugged it in somewhere.|S|Bro021
mn052|and then i mean it's like i had to remove some part.|S|Bro021
mn052|and then plugging it in somewhere.|S|Bro021
mn052|and then i in that process i messed it up somewhere.|S|Bro021
mn052|so|F|Bro021
me013|okay.|B|Bro021
mn052|so it was|D|Bro021
mn052|i mean i thought it was all fine.|S|Bro021
mn052|and then i ran it and i got something worse than not using it.|S|Bro021
mn052|so|F|Bro021
mn052|i was like i'm trying to find where the problem came.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn052|and it seems to be like somewhere.|S|Bro021
me013|okay.|B|Bro021
mn052|some silly stuff.|S|Bro021
mn052|and um the other thing uh was uh uh|D|Bro021
mn052|well hynek showed up one suddenly on one day.|S|Bro021
mn052|and then i was talking|D|Bro021
me013|right.|B|Bro021
me013|yeah.|S|Bro021
me013|as as he is wont to do.|S|Bro021
me013|yeah.|F|Bro021
mn052|uh yeah.|F|Bro021
mn052|so i was actually that day i was thinking about doing something about the wiener filtering and then carlos matter of stuff.|S|Bro021
mn052|and then he showed up.|S|Bro021
mn052|and then i told him.|S|Bro021
mn052|and then he gave me a whole bunch of filters.|S|Bro021
mn052|what carlos used for his uh uh thesis.|S|Bro021
mn052|and then that was something which came up.|S|Bro021
mn052|and then um|F|Bro021
mn052|so uh i'm actually uh thinking of using that also in this uh wiener filtering.|S|Bro021
mn052|because that is a modified wiener filtering approach.|S|Bro021
mn052|where instead of using the current frame it uses adjacent frames also in designing the wiener filter.|S|Bro021
mn052|so instead of designing our own new wiener filters i may just use one of those carlos filters in in this implementation.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn052|and see whether it it actually gives me something better.|S|Bro021
mn052|than using just the current current frame.|S|Bro021
mn052|which is in a way uh something like the smoothing the wiener filter.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn052|but|F|Bro021
mn052|so i don't know.|F|Bro021
mn052|i was|D|Bro021
mn052|i'm i'm i'm like|D|Bro021
mn052|that so that is the next thing once this i once i sort this uh problem out maybe i'll just go into that also.|S|Bro021
mn052|and|F|Bro021
mn052|the the other thing was about the subspace approach.|S|Bro021
mn052|so um|F|Bro021
mn052|i like plugged some groupings for computing this uh uh uh values and eigenvectors.|S|Bro021
mn052|so just i just some small block of things which i needed to put together for the subspace approach.|S|Bro021
mn052|and i'm in the process of like building up that stuff.|S|Bro021
mn052|and um|F|Bro021
mn052|uh yeah.|F|Bro021
mn052|i guess yep i guess that's it.|S|Bro021
mn052|and uh that's where i am right now.|S|Bro021
mn052|so|F|Bro021
me018|oh how about you carmen?|Q|Bro021
fn002|huh i'm working with v t s.|S|Bro021
fn002|um i do several experiment with the spanish database first.|S|Bro021
fn002|only with v t s and nothing more.|S|Bro021
fn002|not v a d.|S|Bro021
fn002|no l d a.|S|Bro021
fn002|nothing more.|S|Bro021
me018|what what is v t s again?|Q|Bro021
mn052|new|D|Bro021
fn002|uh vectorial taylor series.|S|Bro021
me018|oh yes.|S|Bro021
me018|right right.|S|Bro021
fn002|to remove the noise too.|S|Bro021
me018|i think i ask you that every single meeting.|S|Bro021
me018|don't i?|Q|Bro021
fn002|what?|Q|Bro021
me018|i ask you that question every meeting.|S|Bro021
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro021
fn002|if well|D|Bro021
me013|so that'd be good from for analysis.|S|Bro021
me013|it's good to have some uh cases of the same utterance at different different times.|S|Bro021
me018|yeah.|S|Bro021
me018|what is v t s?|Q|Bro021
me013|yeah.|F|Bro021
fn002|v t s.|S|Bro021
fn002|i'm|D|Bro021
fn002|well um the question is that|D|Bro021
fn002|well.|F|Bro021
fn002|remove some noise but not too much.|S|Bro021
fn002|and when we put the the them v a d the result is better.|S|Bro021
fn002|and we put everything the result is better.|S|Bro021
fn002|but it's not better than the result that we have without v t s.|S|Bro021
fn002|no no.|S|Bro021
me013|i see.|S|Bro021
me013|so that given that you're using the v a d also the effect of the v t s is not so far|D|Bro021
fn002|is not.|S|Bro021
me013|do you how much of that do you think is due to just the particular implementation and how much you're adjusting it?|Q|Bro021
me013|or how much do you think is intrinsic to|D|Bro021
fn002|pfft i don't know.|S|Bro021
fn002|because|D|Bro021
fn002|hhh|F|Bro021
mn007|are you still using only the ten first frame for noise estimation?|Q|Bro021
mn007|or|D|Bro021
fn002|uh i do the experiment using only the uh to use only one fair estimation of the noise.|S|Bro021
mn007|or|D|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro021
mn007|huh.|B|Bro021
fn002|and also i did some experiment uh doing um a lying estimation of the noise.|S|Bro021
fn002|and well it's a little bit better but not|D|Bro021
mn007|maybe you have to standardize this thing also.|S|Bro021
mn007|noise estimation.|S|Bro021
mn007|because all the thing that you are testing use a different|D|Bro021
fn002|huh.|B|Bro021
mn052|huh.|B|Bro021
mn007|they all need some some noise noise spectra.|S|Bro021
fn002|no i do that two did two time.|S|Bro021
mn007|but they use every all use a different one.|S|Bro021
me013|i have an idea.|S|Bro021
me013|if if uh uh|D|Bro021
me013|you're right.|S|Bro021
me013|i mean each of these require this.|S|Bro021
me013|um given that we're going to have for this test at least of uh boundaries what if initially we start off by using known sections of nonspeech for the estimation?|Q|Bro021
fn002|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me013|right?|Q|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro021
me013|so um|F|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me013|first place i mean even if ultimately we wouldn't be given the boundaries uh this would be a good initial experiment to separate out the effects of things.|S|Bro021
me013|i mean how much is the poor you know relatively uh unhelpful result that you're getting in this or this or this?|Q|Bro021
me013|is due to some inherent limitation to the method for these tasks?|Q|Bro021
me013|and how much of it is just due to the fact that you're not accurately finding enough regions that that are really noise?|Q|Bro021
mn052|huh.|B|Bro021
fn002|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me013|um|F|Bro021
me013|so maybe if you tested it using that you'd have more reliable stretches of nonspeech to do the estimation from.|S|Bro021
me013|and see if that helps.|S|Bro021
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro021
fn002|another thing is the them the codebook.|S|Bro021
fn002|the initial codebook.|S|Bro021
fn002|that maybe|D|Bro021
fn002|well it's too clean.|S|Bro021
fn002|and|F|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
fn002|because it's a|D|Bro021
fn002|i don't know.|F|Bro021
fn002|the methods|D|Bro021
fn002|if you want you i can say something about the method.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|S|Bro021
fn002|yeah in the|D|Bro021
fn002|because it's a little bit different of the other method.|S|Bro021
fn002|well we have|D|Bro021
fn002|if this if this is the noise signal uh in the log domain we have something like this.|S|Bro021
fn002|now we have something like this.|S|Bro021
fn002|and the idea of these methods is to given a um|D|Bro021
me013|huh huh.|B|Bro021
fn002|how do you say?|Q|Bro021
fn002|i will read because it's better for my english.|S|Bro021
fn002|given|D|Bro021
fn002|is the estimate of the p d f of the noise signal.|S|Bro021
fn002|when we have a um a statistic of the clean speech and an statistic of the noisy speech.|S|Bro021
fn002|and the clean speech the statistic of the clean speech is from a codebook.|S|Bro021
fn002|huh this is the idea.|S|Bro021
fn002|well like this relation is not linear.|S|Bro021
fn002|the methods propose to develop this in a vectorial taylor series approximation.|S|Bro021
me013|i'm actually just confused about the equations you have up there.|S|Bro021
me013|so uh|F|Bro021
me013|the top equation is is is|D|Bro021
fn002|no this in the it's this is the log domain.|S|Bro021
fn002|i i must to say that.|S|Bro021
me013|which is which is the log domain?|Q|Bro021
fn002|is the t is egual is equal to uh log of|D|Bro021
me013|and|D|Bro021
me013|but y is what?|Q|Bro021
me013|y of the spectrum?|Q|Bro021
fn002|uh this this is this.|S|Bro021
me013|or|D|Bro021
fn002|and this is this.|S|Bro021
me013|no no.|S|Bro021
me013|the top y is what?|Q|Bro021
fn002|uhhuh.|S|Bro021
me013|is that power spectrum?|Q|Bro021
fn002|uh this is the noisy speech.|S|Bro021
mn007|this|D|Bro021
me013|no is that power spectrum?|Q|Bro021
me013|is it|D|Bro021
mn007|yeah i guess it's the power spectrum of noisy speech.|S|Bro021
fn002|yeah it's the power spectrum.|S|Bro021
me013|oh okay.|S|Bro021
mn007|yeah and|F|Bro021
me013|so that's uh|D|Bro021
fn002|this is the noisy|D|Bro021
fn002|yeah it's|D|Bro021
fn002|of the value.|S|Bro021
me013|okay.|S|Bro021
me013|yeah.|S|Bro021
me013|okay.|S|Bro021
me013|so this it's the magnitude squared or something.|S|Bro021
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro021
me013|okay so you have power spectrum added there.|S|Bro021
me013|and down here you have you you put the|D|Bro021
me013|depends on t.|S|Bro021
me013|but all of this is just you just mean|D|Bro021
fn002|yeah it's the same.|S|Bro021
me013|you just mean the log of the of the one up above.|S|Bro021
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me013|and uh so that is x times|D|Bro021
me013|uh|F|Bro021
fn002|yeah maybe|F|Bro021
mn052|one one plus n by x.|S|Bro021
fn002|but|F|Bro021
fn002|well we can we can put this expression|D|Bro021
me013|x times one plus uh n uh n n n minus x?|Q|Bro021
fn002|the|D|Bro021
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro021
me013|and then|D|Bro021
fn002|and the noise signal.|S|Bro021
me013|uh so that's log of x plus log of one plus uh|D|Bro021
me013|well.|F|Bro021
me013|is that right?|Q|Bro021
me013|log of|D|Bro021
mn052|one plus n by x.|S|Bro021
fn002|well huh|F|Bro021
me013|i actually don't see how you get that.|S|Bro021
fn002|well if we apply the log we have e is|D|Bro021
me013|uh|F|Bro021
mn007|huh.|B|Bro021
fn002|uh log e is equal oh to log of x plus n.|S|Bro021
mn052|uh and|D|Bro021
me013|yeah.|S|Bro021
fn002|and well|F|Bro021
mn052|and log of|D|Bro021
fn002|uh we can say that e is equal to log of um exponential of x plus exponential of n.|S|Bro021
me013|uh|F|Bro021
mn052|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me013|no.|S|Bro021
mn052|no.|S|Bro021
me013|that doesn't follow.|S|Bro021
mn052|well if e restricts|D|Bro021
mn052|it is|D|Bro021
fn002|well this is this is in the the time domain.|S|Bro021
fn002|well we have that|D|Bro021
fn002|um|F|Bro021
fn002|we have first that for example x is equal|D|Bro021
fn002|uh|F|Bro021
fn002|well.|F|Bro021
fn002|this is the frequency domain.|S|Bro021
fn002|and we can put that the log domain.|S|Bro021
me013|yeah.|B|Bro021
fn002|log of x omega.|S|Bro021
fn002|but well in the time domain we have an exponential.|S|Bro021
fn002|no?|Q|Bro021
fn002|no?|Q|Bro021
fn002|oh maybe it's i am|D|Bro021
fn002|i'm problem.|S|Bro021
me013|yeah.|S|Bro021
me013|i mean just never mind what they are.|S|Bro021
me013|uh it's just if x and n are variables.|S|Bro021
me013|right?|Q|Bro021
mn052|what is uh|D|Bro021
me013|the the the log of x plus n is not the same as the log of e to the x plus e to the n.|S|Bro021
fn002|yeah.|F|Bro021
fn002|but this|D|Bro021
fn002|well i don't|D|Bro021
fn002|well uh|F|Bro021
me013|maybe we can take it off line.|S|Bro021
fn002|maybe|D|Bro021
me013|but i i don't know.|F|Bro021
fn002|i i can do this incorrectly.|S|Bro021
fn002|well the expression that appear in the in the paper is uh|D|Bro021
mn052|the log.|S|Bro021
mn052|the taylor series expansion for log one plus n by x is|D|Bro021
fn002|is x|D|Bro021
mn007|is it the first order expansion.|S|Bro021
me013|okay.|S|Bro021
mn052|yeah the first one.|S|Bro021
mn007|yeah i guess.|F|Bro021
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro021
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro021
me013|okay.|F|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro021
me013|yeah because it doesn't just follow what's there.|S|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
mn052|yeah if if you take log x into log one plus n by x and then expand the log one plus n by x into taylor series.|S|Bro021
me013|it has to be some uh taylor series.|S|Bro021
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro021
fn002|now this is the|D|Bro021
fn002|and then|D|Bro021
mn007|yeah but the the second expression that you put is the first order expansion of the nonlinear relation between|D|Bro021
fn002|not exactly.|S|Bro021
me013|no.|S|Bro021
fn002|no no no.|S|Bro021
fn002|it's not the first space.|S|Bro021
fn002|well we have pfft uh them|D|Bro021
fn002|well we can put that x is equal i is equal to log of uh|D|Bro021
fn002|huh|F|Bro021
me013|that doesn't follow.|S|Bro021
fn002|well we can put uh this?|Q|Bro021
mn052|huh.|B|Bro021
mn052|no.|S|Bro021
me013|that i mean that the top one does not imply the second one.|S|Bro021
fn002|the top?|Q|Bro021
me013|because because the log of a sum is not the same as|D|Bro021
fn002|yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.|S|Bro021
me013|i mean as|D|Bro021
me013|yeah.|F|Bro021
fn002|but we can|D|Bro021
fn002|uh we we know that for example the log of e plus b is equal to log of e plus log to b.|S|Bro021
me013|right.|S|Bro021
fn002|and we can say here it|D|Bro021
me013|right so you could|D|Bro021
mn007|what is that?|Q|Bro021
fn002|and we can uh put this inside.|S|Bro021
me013|yeah.|S|Bro021
fn002|and then we can|D|Bro021
fn002|uh|F|Bro021
fn002|you know?|Q|Bro021
me013|no.|S|Bro021
me013|but|D|Bro021
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro021
mn052|uh.|B|Bro021
me013|i don't see how you get the second expression from the top one.|S|Bro021
me013|the i mean just more generally here if you say log of um a plus b|D|Bro021
me013|the log of log of a plus b is not|D|Bro021
me013|or a plus b is not the um log of e to the a plus e to the b.|S|Bro021
fn002|no no no no no no no.|S|Bro021
fn002|this not.|S|Bro021
fn002|no.|S|Bro021
me013|right?|Q|Bro021
me013|and that's what you seem to be saying.|S|Bro021
fn002|no.|S|Bro021
fn002|it's not but this is the same|D|Bro021
fn002|oh.|S|Bro021
me013|right?|Q|Bro021
me013|because you because you up here you have the a plus b.|S|Bro021
fn002|no.|S|Bro021
fn002|i say if i apply log i have uh log of e is equal to log of uh in this side is equal to log of x.|S|Bro021
me013|plus n.|S|Bro021
fn002|plus n.|S|Bro021
me013|right.|S|Bro021
fn002|no?|Q|Bro021
fn002|right.|S|Bro021
me013|right.|S|Bro021
me013|and then how do you go from there to the|D|Bro021
fn002|this is right.|S|Bro021
fn002|and then if i apply exponential to have here e|D|Bro021
me013|look.|S|Bro021
me013|okay.|F|Bro021
me013|so let's|D|Bro021
me013|i mean c equals a plus b .|S|Bro021
mn007|it's log of capital y.|S|Bro021
mn007|yeah right.|F|Bro021
me013|and then|D|Bro021
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro021
mn007|capital y.|S|Bro021
mn052|x x.|S|Bro021
mn052|this is x inside.|S|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
fn002|we have this.|S|Bro021
me013|right.|S|Bro021
fn002|no?|Q|Bro021
me013|yeah.|S|Bro021
me013|that one's right.|S|Bro021
fn002|uhhuh.|S|Bro021
mn052|one and|D|Bro021
fn002|uh we can put here the set transformation.|S|Bro021
me013|oh.|S|Bro021
me013|i see.|S|Bro021
fn002|no?|Q|Bro021
me013|i see.|S|Bro021
me013|okay i understand now.|S|Bro021
me013|all right thanks.|S|Bro021
fn002|yeah.|F|Bro021
fn002|in this case well we can put here a y.|S|Bro021
me013|okay.|F|Bro021
me013|so yeah.|F|Bro021
me013|it's just by definition that the individual that the uh|D|Bro021
me013|so capital x is by definition the same as e to the little x.|S|Bro021
me013|because she's saying that the little x is is the uh is the log.|S|Bro021
me013|all right.|S|Bro021
fn002|now we can put this.|S|Bro021
me013|yeah.|S|Bro021
fn002|no?|Q|Bro021
fn002|and here we can multiply by x.|S|Bro021
me013|all right.|B|Bro021
me013|i think these things are a lot clearer when you can use fonts different fonts there.|S|Bro021
fn002|oh yes.|S|Bro021
me013|so you know which is which.|S|Bro021
fn002|yeah yeah.|S|Bro021
me013|but i i i understand what you mean now.|S|Bro021
fn002|that's true.|S|Bro021
fn002|that's true.|S|Bro021
me013|okay.|S|Bro021
fn002|but this this is correct.|S|Bro021
me013|sure.|S|Bro021
fn002|and now i can do it|D|Bro021
fn002|uh|F|Bro021
fn002|pfff!|S|Bro021
fn002|i can put log of e x plus log.|S|Bro021
me013|oh.|B|Bro021
me013|yes i understand now.|S|Bro021
fn002|and this is|D|Bro021
me013|and that's where it comes from.|S|Bro021
me013|yeah.|F|Bro021
mn007|yeah right.|B|Bro021
me013|right.|B|Bro021
fn002|now it's correct.|S|Bro021
me013|right.|B|Bro021
me013|okay.|S|Bro021
me013|thanks.|S|Bro021
fn002|well the idea|D|Bro021
fn002|well.|F|Bro021
fn002|we have fixed this|D|Bro021
me013|okay so now once you get that that one then you then you do a or second order or something taylor series expansion of this.|S|Bro021
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro021
fn002|this is another linear relation that this to develop this in vectors taylor series.|S|Bro021
mn007|yeah sure.|B|Bro021
me013|right.|B|Bro021
fn002|uhhuh.|S|Bro021
fn002|and for that well the goal is to obtain um estimate a p d f for the noisy speech.|S|Bro021
fn002|when we have a a statistic for clean speech and for the noisy speech.|S|Bro021
fn002|huh?|Q|Bro021
fn002|and when|D|Bro021
fn002|the way to obtain the p d f for the noisy speech is|D|Bro021
fn002|well we know this statistic.|S|Bro021
fn002|and we know the noisy|D|Bro021
fn002|well we can apply first order of the vector taylor series of the of the of well the order that we want increase the complexity of the problem.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
fn002|and then when we have a expression uh for the mean and variance of the noisy speech we apply a technique of minimum mean square estimation.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
fn002|to obtain the expected value of the clean speech given the this statistic for the noisy speech.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
fn002|the statistic for clean speech and the statistic of the noisy speech.|S|Bro021
fn002|this only that.|S|Bro021
fn002|but the idea is that.|S|Bro021
mn007|and the the model of clean speech is a codebook right?|S|Bro021
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro021
fn002|we have our codebook with different density gaussian.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
fn002|we can we can put that the p d f for the clean test probability of the clean speech is equal to|D|Bro021
me013|yeah.|B|Bro021
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me013|so um|F|Bro021
me013|how|D|Bro021
me013|how much in in the work they reported how much noisy speech did you need to get uh good enough statistics?|Q|Bro021
me013|for the to get this mapping.|S|Bro021
fn002|i don't know exactly.|S|Bro021
me013|yeah.|S|Bro021
fn002|i i need to|D|Bro021
me013|yeah.|B|Bro021
fn002|i don't know exactly.|S|Bro021
me013|because i think what's certainly characteristic of a lot of the data in this test is that um you don't have the|D|Bro021
me013|the training set may not be a a great estimator for the noise in the test set.|S|Bro021
me013|sometimes it is.|S|Bro021
me013|and sometimes it's not.|S|Bro021
fn002|yeah.|F|Bro021
fn002|i the clean speech the codebook for clean speech i am using timit.|S|Bro021
fn002|and i have now uh sixty four gaussian.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me013|and what are you using for the noisy|D|Bro021
me013|doing that strictly|D|Bro021
fn002|of the noise|D|Bro021
fn002|i estimate the noises|D|Bro021
fn002|well for the noises i only use one gaussian.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me013|and and you and you train it up entirely from uh nonspeech sections in the test?|Q|Bro021
mn007|huh.|B|Bro021
fn002|uh yes.|S|Bro021
fn002|the first experiment that i do it is solely to calculate the huh well this value.|S|Bro021
me013|yeah.|B|Bro021
fn002|uh the compensation of the dictionary one time.|S|Bro021
fn002|using the the noise at the beginning of the sentence.|S|Bro021
fn002|this is the first experiment.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me013|yeah.|B|Bro021
fn002|and i fix this for all the all the sentences.|S|Bro021
fn002|uh because|D|Bro021
fn002|well the v t s methods|D|Bro021
fn002|in fact the first thing that i do is to to obtain uh an expression for e.|S|Bro021
fn002|probability expression of of e.|S|Bro021
fn002|that mean that the v t s huh with the v t s we obtain|D|Bro021
fn002|uh|F|Bro021
fn002|well we we obtain the means for each gaussian and the variance.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
fn002|this is one.|S|Bro021
fn002|uh this is the composition of the dictionary.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
fn002|this one thing.|S|Bro021
fn002|and the other thing that this with these methods is to uh obtain to calculate this value.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
fn002|because we can write|D|Bro021
fn002|uh we can write that the estimation of the clean speech is equal at an expected value of the clean speech conditional to uh the noise signal the probability of the the statistic of the clean speech and the statistic of the noise.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
fn002|this is the methods that say that we're going obtain this.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
fn002|and we can put that this is equal to the estimated value of e minus a function that conditional to e to the t to the noise signal.|S|Bro021
fn002|well this is this function is the the term after develop this the term that we we take.|S|Bro021
fn002|give p x and uh p the noise.|S|Bro021
mn052|x k c noise.|S|Bro021
me013|huh.|B|Bro021
fn002|and i can put that this is equal to the noise signal minus|D|Bro021
fn002|well i put before this name|D|Bro021
fn002|uh|F|Bro021
fn002|and i can calculate this.|S|Bro021
me013|what is the first variable in that probability?|Q|Bro021
fn002|uh this is the gaussian.|S|Bro021
me013|no no i'm sorry.|S|Bro021
me013|in in the one you pointed at.|S|Bro021
me013|what's that variable?|Q|Bro021
fn002|uh this is the|D|Bro021
mn052|weak.|S|Bro021
mn052|so probably it it would do that.|S|Bro021
fn002|like this.|S|Bro021
mn007|it's one mixture of the model right?|S|Bro021
fn002|but conditional.|S|Bro021
fn002|no it's|D|Bro021
fn002|it's not exactly this.|S|Bro021
fn002|it's modify.|S|Bro021
fn002|uh if we have clean speech we have the dictionary for the clean speech we have a probability of our our weight for each gaussian.|S|Bro021
fn002|no?|Q|Bro021
fn002|and now this weight is different now.|S|Bro021
me013|okay.|B|Bro021
me013|yes.|B|Bro021
fn002|because it's conditional.|S|Bro021
fn002|and this i need to to|D|Bro021
fn002|i know this.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
fn002|and i know this.|S|Bro021
fn002|because this is from the dictionary that you have.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
fn002|i need to calculate this.|S|Bro021
fn002|and for calculate this i have an i i can develop an expression that is|D|Bro021
me013|yes.|B|Bro021
fn002|that.|S|Bro021
fn002|i can calculate i can i calculated this value uh with the statistic of the noisy speech that i calculated before with the v t s approximation.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
fn002|and well normalizing.|S|Bro021
fn002|and i know everything.|S|Bro021
fn002|uh with the|D|Bro021
fn002|nnn|F|Bro021
fn002|when i develop this in taylor taylor series i can't um calculate the mean and the variance of the for each of the gaussian of the dictionary for the noisy speech.|S|Bro021
fn002|and this is fixed.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
fn002|if i never do an a newer estimation of the noise this mean as mean and the variance are fixed.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
fn002|and for each uh frame of the speech the only thing that i need to do is to calculate this.|S|Bro021
fn002|in order to calculate the estimation of the clean speech given our noisy speech.|S|Bro021
me013|so i'm i'm not following this perfectly.|S|Bro021
me013|but um|F|Bro021
me013|i|D|Bro021
me013|are you saying that all of these estimates are done using um estimates of the probability density for the noise that are calculated only from the first ten frames?|Q|Bro021
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro021
me013|and never change throughout anything else.|S|Bro021
fn002|never|D|Bro021
fn002|this is one of the approximations that i am doing.|S|Bro021
me013|per per per utterance?|Q|Bro021
me013|or per|D|Bro021
fn002|per utterance yes.|S|Bro021
me013|per utterance.|S|Bro021
fn002|per utterance yes.|S|Bro021
me013|okay.|S|Bro021
me013|so it's done it's done new for each new utterance.|S|Bro021
fn002|and|D|Bro021
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro021
me013|so this changes the whole mapping for every utterance.|S|Bro021
fn002|it's not|D|Bro021
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro021
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro021
fn002|it's fixed the dictionary.|S|Bro021
me013|okay.|S|Bro021
fn002|and the other estimation is when i do the uh on line estimation i change the means and variance of for the noisy speech.|S|Bro021
me013|okay.|B|Bro021
me013|yeah?|Q|Bro021
fn002|each time that i detect noise.|S|Bro021
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro021
fn002|i do it uh again this.|S|Bro021
fn002|develop.|S|Bro021
fn002|estimate the new mean and the variance of the noisy speech.|S|Bro021
fn002|and with with this new new mean and variance i estimate again this.|S|Bro021
me013|so you estimated uh completely forgetting what you had before?|Q|Bro021
fn002|um|F|Bro021
me013|uh or is there some adaptation?|Q|Bro021
fn002|no no no it's not completely noise.|S|Bro021
fn002|i am doing something like an adaptation of the noise.|S|Bro021
me013|okay.|B|Bro021
me013|now do we know either from their experience or from yours that uh just having uh two parameters the the mean and variance is enough?|Q|Bro021
me013|yeah.|F|Bro021
me013|i mean i know you don't have a lot of data to estimate with.|S|Bro021
me013|but but uh|F|Bro021
me013|um|F|Bro021
fn002|i estimate mean and variance for each one of the gaussian of the codebook.|S|Bro021
me013|no i'm talking about the noise.|S|Bro021
fn002|oh.|S|Bro021
fn002|um well only one|D|Bro021
me013|there's only one gaussian.|S|Bro021
fn002|i am only using only one.|S|Bro021
me013|right.|S|Bro021
fn002|i don't know|D|Bro021
me013|and you and and it's|D|Bro021
me013|uh uh|F|Bro021
me013|right.|S|Bro021
me013|it's only|D|Bro021
me013|it's only one|D|Bro021
me013|wait a minute.|S|Bro021
me013|this is|D|Bro021
me013|what's the dimensionality of the gaussian?|Q|Bro021
me013|this is|D|Bro021
fn002|uh it's in after the mel filter bank.|S|Bro021
me013|so this is twenty or something?|Q|Bro021
fn002|twenty three.|S|Bro021
me013|twenty?|Q|Bro021
me013|so it's|D|Bro021
me013|yeah so it's actually forty numbers that you're getting.|S|Bro021
me013|yeah maybe maybe you don't have a|D|Bro021
fn002|uh the original paper say that only one gaussian for the noise.|S|Bro021
me013|well yeah.|S|Bro021
me013|but i mean no no paper is is a bible.|S|Bro021
fn002|yeah maybe isn't the right thing.|S|Bro021
me013|you know?|Q|Bro021
me013|this is this is uh|D|Bro021
fn002|yeah yeah yeah.|B|Bro021
me013|the question is um whether it would be helpful particularly if you used if you had more|D|Bro021
me013|so suppose you did|D|Bro021
me013|this is almost cheating.|S|Bro021
me013|it certainly isn't real time.|S|Bro021
me013|but if suppose you use the real boundaries that that you were in fact were given by the v a d and so forth.|S|Bro021
me013|or i i guess we're going to be given even better boundaries than that.|S|Bro021
me013|and you look you take all all of the nonspeech components in an utterance.|S|Bro021
me013|so you have a fair amount.|S|Bro021
me013|do you benefit from having a better model for the noise?|Q|Bro021
me013|that would be another question.|S|Bro021
fn002|maybe.|S|Bro021
me013|so first question would be to what extent are the errors that you're still seeing based on the fact that you have poor boundaries for the uh uh nonspeech.|S|Bro021
me013|and the second question might be given that you have good boundaries could you do better if you used more parameters to characterize the noise.|S|Bro021
me013|um|F|Bro021
me013|also another question might be|D|Bro021
me013|um they are doing they're using first term only of the vector taylor series?|Q|Bro021
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro021
me013|um if you do a second term does it get too complicated because of the nonlinearity?|Q|Bro021
fn002|yeah it's quite complicated.|S|Bro021
me013|yeah okay.|S|Bro021
me013|no i won't ask the next question then.|S|Bro021
fn002|oh it's it's the for me it's the first time that i am working with v t s.|S|Bro021
fn002|uh|F|Bro021
me013|yeah.|S|Bro021
me013|no it's interesting.|S|Bro021
me013|uh we haven't had anybody work with it before.|S|Bro021
me013|so it's interesting to get your get your feedback about it.|S|Bro021
fn002|it's another type of approximation because because it's a statistic statistic approximation to remove the noise.|S|Bro021
fn002|i don't know.|S|Bro021
me013|right.|B|Bro021
me018|great.|S|Bro021
me018|okay.|F|Bro021
me018|well i guess we're about done.|S|Bro021
me018|um|F|Bro021
me018|so some of the digit forms don't have digits.|S|Bro021
me018|uh we ran out.|S|Bro021
me018|and there were some blanks in there.|S|Bro021
me018|so not everybody will be reading digits.|S|Bro021
me018|but um|F|Bro021
me018|i guess you've got some right morgan?|S|Bro021
me013|i have some.|S|Bro021
me018|so|F|Bro021
me018|why don't you go ahead and start?|Q|Bro021
me018|and i think it's just us down here at this end that have them.|S|Bro021
me018|so|F|Bro021
me013|uh okay.|S|Bro021
mn052|so we switch off with this?|Q|Bro021
me018|whenever you're ready.|S|Bro021
mn052|or|D|Bro021
me018|uh leave it on.|S|Bro021
mn052|no okay.|S|Bro021
me018|uh|F|Bro021
me013|they prefer to have them on.|S|Bro021
me018|and the|D|Bro021
me013|just so that they're continuing to get the distant uh information.|S|Bro021
me018|yeah.|B|Bro021
mn052|okay.|B|Bro021
mn052|okay.|B|Bro021
