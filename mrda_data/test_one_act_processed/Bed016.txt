me003|are we to just to make sure i know what's going on we're talking about robert's thesis proposal today?|Q|Bed016
me003|is that|D|Bed016
mn015|we could.|S|Bed016
me003|true?|Q|Bed016
fe004|we are?|Q|Bed016
mn015|we might.|S|Bed016
fe004|okay.|S|Bed016
me010|well you you had you said there were two things that you might want to do.|S|Bed016
me003|is|D|Bed016
me010|one was rehearse your talk|D|Bed016
me003|oh yes and that too.|S|Bed016
mn015|not not rehearse.|S|Bed016
mn015|i mean i have just not spent any time on it.|S|Bed016
mn015|so i can show you what i've got get your input on it and maybe some suggestions.|S|Bed016
mn015|that would be great.|S|Bed016
mn015|and the same is true for the proposal.|S|Bed016
mn015|i will have time to do some revision and some additional stuff on various airplanes and trains.|S|Bed016
mn015|so um|F|Bed016
mn015|i don't know how much of a chance you had to actually read it.|S|Bed016
fe004|i haven't looked at it.|S|Bed016
mn015|because|D|Bed016
fe004|yet.|S|Bed016
mn015|but you could always send me comments per electronic mail.|S|Bed016
fe004|but i will.|S|Bed016
mn015|and they will be incorporated.|S|Bed016
fe004|okay.|S|Bed016
mn015|um the|F|Bed016
mn015|it basically says well this is construal.|S|Bed016
mn015|and then it continues to say that one could potentially build a probabilistic relational model that has some general domain general rules|D|Bed016
mn015|how things are construed.|S|Bed016
mn015|and then the idea is to use ontology situation user and discourse model to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilistic relational model to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as what.|S|Bed016
fe004|huh.|B|Bed016
mn015|in our beloved tourism domain.|S|Bed016
mn015|but with a focus on|D|Bed016
fe004|can i|D|Bed016
me045|i think i need a copy of this yes.|S|Bed016
fe004|sorry.|S|Bed016
mn015|huh?|Q|Bed016
me045|is there an extra copy around?|Q|Bed016
me003|okay we can we can we can pass pass my uh we can pass my extra copy around.|S|Bed016
fe004|uh he sent it.|S|Bed016
fe004|okay you can keep it.|S|Bed016
me003|uh actually my only copy now that i think about it.|S|Bed016
fe004|okay.|S|Bed016
me003|but i already read half of it.|S|Bed016
mn015|um i don't i uh i don't need it.|S|Bed016
me003|so it's okay.|S|Bed016
me045|okay.|S|Bed016
mn015|um actually this is the the newest version after your comments.|S|Bed016
mn015|and|F|Bed016
me010|yeah no i i i see this has got the castle in it and stuff like that.|S|Bed016
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed016
me010|yep.|B|Bed016
me003|oh maybe the version i didn't have|D|Bed016
me003|that i mine the|D|Bed016
me003|did the one you sent on the email have the|D|Bed016
me010|yeah.|S|Bed016
me003|that was the most recent one?|Q|Bed016
me010|uh yeah i think so.|S|Bed016
me003|okay.|S|Bed016
mn015|yep.|S|Bed016
me003|because i read halfway but i didn't see a castle thing.|S|Bed016
fe004|i'm changing this.|S|Bed016
fe004|just so you know.|S|Bed016
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed016
fe004|but anyway|D|Bed016
mn015|um if you would have checked your email you may have received a note from yees asking you to send me the uh|D|Bed016
fe004|oh oh sorry.|S|Bed016
fe004|okay.|S|Bed016
fe004|sorry.|S|Bed016
mn015|current formalism thing that you presented.|S|Bed016
fe004|okay i will.|S|Bed016
fe004|okay okay.|S|Bed016
fe004|okay.|S|Bed016
mn015|but for this it doesn't matter.|S|Bed016
mn015|but uh|F|Bed016
fe004|we can talk about it later.|S|Bed016
fe004|that's not even ready.|S|Bed016
fe004|so um|F|Bed016
fe004|okay go on to uh whatever.|S|Bed016
mn015|and|F|Bed016
fe004|i'm making changes.|S|Bed016
fe004|don't worry about that.|S|Bed016
fe004|okay uhhuh|B|Bed016
fe004|oh okay sorry.|S|Bed016
fe004|go on.|S|Bed016
mn015|and any type of comment whether it's a spelling or a syntax or|D|Bed016
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
me045|there's only one s in interesting.|S|Bed016
mn015|readability|D|Bed016
mn015|huh?|Q|Bed016
me045|there's only one s in interesting on page five.|S|Bed016
mn015|interesting.|S|Bed016
fe004|anyway.|F|Bed016
fe004|and uh email any time.|S|Bed016
fe004|but most usefully before|D|Bed016
me003|the twenty first i'm assuming.|S|Bed016
fe004|the twenty first?|Q|Bed016
mn015|twenty ninth.|S|Bed016
me010|no this is the twenty first.|S|Bed016
me045|that's|D|Bed016
me003|what?|Q|Bed016
me003|today's the twenty first?|Q|Bed016
me045|well better hurry up then!|S|Bed016
me003|oh man!|S|Bed016
mn015|the twenty ninth.|S|Bed016
fe004|before the twenty ninth.|S|Bed016
fe004|okay.|S|Bed016
me003|okay.|S|Bed016
mn015|that's when i'm meeting with wolfgang wahlster to sell him this idea.|S|Bed016
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
fe004|okay.|S|Bed016
mn015|okay.|F|Bed016
mn015|then i'm also going to present a little talk at e m l about what we have done here.|S|Bed016
mn015|and so|F|Bed016
mn015|of course i'm i'm going to start out with this slide.|S|Bed016
mn015|so the most relevant aspects of our stay here.|S|Bed016
mn015|and um|F|Bed016
mn015|then i'm asking them to imagine that they're standing somewhere in heidelberg.|S|Bed016
mn015|and someone asks them in the morning the cave forty five is a is a well known discotheque.|S|Bed016
mn015|which is certainly not open at that that time.|S|Bed016
me045|okay.|B|Bed016
mn015|and so|F|Bed016
mn015|they're supposed to imagine that you know do they think the person wants to go there or just know where it is.|S|Bed016
mn015|uh|F|Bed016
mn015|which is probably not uh the case in that discotheque example.|S|Bed016
mn015|or in the bavaria example.|S|Bed016
mn015|you just want to know where it is.|S|Bed016
mn015|and so forth.|S|Bed016
mn015|so basically we can make a point that here is ontological knowledge.|S|Bed016
mn015|but if it's nine nine p m in the evening then the discotheque question would be for example one that might ask for directions instead of just location.|S|Bed016
mn015|um and so forth and so forth.|S|Bed016
mn015|that's sort of motivating it.|S|Bed016
mn015|then what have we done so far?|Q|Bed016
mn015|we had our little bit of um um smartkom stuff that we did.|S|Bed016
mn015|um|F|Bed016
me045|oh you've got the parser done.|S|Bed016
me045|sorry.|S|Bed016
mn015|that's the not the construction parser.|S|Bed016
me045|okay.|S|Bed016
mn015|that's the uh tablet based parser.|S|Bed016
fe004|easy parser.|S|Bed016
me045|okay.|B|Bed016
mn015|and|F|Bed016
mn015|the generation outputter.|S|Bed016
me003|halfway done.|S|Bed016
me003|yeah.|B|Bed016
mn015|that's done.|S|Bed016
fe004|huh.|B|Bed016
mn015|you have to change those strategies.|S|Bed016
me003|okay.|S|Bed016
mn015|right?|Q|Bed016
me003|yeah.|S|Bed016
mn015|that's ten words?|Q|Bed016
me003|well it you know|D|Bed016
me003|maybe twelve.|S|Bed016
mn015|twelve okay.|S|Bed016
mn015|and um and fey is doing the synthesis stuff as we speak.|S|Bed016
mn015|that's all about that.|S|Bed016
mn015|then i'm going to talk about the data.|S|Bed016
mn015|you know these things about|D|Bed016
mn015|uh actually i have an example|D|Bed016
mn015|probably.|S|Bed016
mn015|two|D|Bed016
mn015|can you hear that?|Q|Bed016
me045|uhhuh.|S|Bed016
mn015|or should i turn the volume on?|Q|Bed016
fe004|i could hear it.|S|Bed016
me003|i can hear it.|S|Bed016
me045|i heard it.|S|Bed016
me003|they might not hear it in the|D|Bed016
me003|well maybe they will.|S|Bed016
me003|i don't know.|S|Bed016
fe004|this was an actual um subject?|Q|Bed016
fe004|uh.|S|Bed016
mn015|uhhuh.|S|Bed016
me045|sounds like fey.|S|Bed016
fe004|yeah.|S|Bed016
mn015|but they're they're mimicking the synthesis when they speak to the computer.|S|Bed016
me045|oh okay.|S|Bed016
mn015|the you can observe that all the time.|S|Bed016
me045|oh really?|Q|Bed016
mn015|they're trying to match their prosody onto the machine.|S|Bed016
me045|interesting.|B|Bed016
me045|oh it's pretty slow.|S|Bed016
mn015|yeah you have to|D|Bed016
me045|the system breaking.|S|Bed016
fe004|what is the|D|Bed016
fe004|oh!|S|Bed016
mn015|okay and so forth and so forth.|S|Bed016
mn015|um i will talk about our problems with the rephrasing.|S|Bed016
mn015|and how we solved it.|S|Bed016
mn015|and some preliminary observations.|S|Bed016
mn015|also um|F|Bed016
mn015|i'm not going to put in the figures from liz.|S|Bed016
mn015|but i thought it would interesting to uh um point out that it's basically the same.|S|Bed016
mn015|um as in every human human telephone conversation and the human computer telephone conversation is of course quite quite different from uh some first uh observations.|S|Bed016
mn015|then|F|Bed016
mn015|sort of feed you back to our original problem.|S|Bed016
mn015|because uh|D|Bed016
mn015|how to get there.|S|Bed016
mn015|what actually is happening there today?|Q|Bed016
mn015|and then maybe talk about the big picture here.|S|Bed016
mn015|tell a little bit as much as i can about the n t l story.|S|Bed016
mn015|i i i do want to um|D|Bed016
mn015|i'm not quite sure about this whether i should put this in.|S|Bed016
mn015|um that you know you have these two sort of different ideas that are or two different camps of people envisioning how language understanding works.|S|Bed016
mn015|and then talk a bit about the embodied and simulation approach favored here.|S|Bed016
mn015|and as a prelude i'll talk about monkeys in italy.|S|Bed016
mn015|and um srini was going to send me some slides.|S|Bed016
mn015|but he didn't do it.|S|Bed016
mn015|so from but i have the paper.|S|Bed016
mn015|i can make a resume of that.|S|Bed016
mn015|and then i stole an x schema from one of your talks i think.|S|Bed016
fe004|oh.|S|Bed016
fe004|i was like where'd you get that.|S|Bed016
me045|yeah that looks familiar.|S|Bed016
fe004|okay.|S|Bed016
fe004|looks familiar.|S|Bed016
mn015|i think that's bergen chang something or the other.|S|Bed016
fe004|uh|B|Bed016
me010|whatever.|S|Bed016
fe004|okay.|B|Bed016
mn015|um and that's|D|Bed016
mn015|now i'm not going to bring that.|S|Bed016
mn015|so that's basically what i have so far.|S|Bed016
mn015|and the rest is for airplanes.|S|Bed016
mn015|so x schemas then i would like to do|D|Bed016
mn015|talk about the construction aspect.|S|Bed016
mn015|and then at the end about our bayes net.|S|Bed016
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
mn015|end of story.|S|Bed016
mn015|anything i forgot that we should mention?|Q|Bed016
mn015|oh maybe the f m r i stuff.|S|Bed016
mn015|should i mention the fact that um we're also actually started going to start to look at people's brains in a more direct way?|Q|Bed016
me010|you certainly can.|S|Bed016
me010|i mean you know i don't know|D|Bed016
fe004|you might just want to like tack that on as a comment to something.|S|Bed016
me010|right.|S|Bed016
me010|um.|F|Bed016
mn015|future activities something?|Q|Bed016
me010|well the time to mention it if you mention it is when you talk about mirror neurons.|S|Bed016
me010|then you should talk about the more recent stuff about the kicking.|S|Bed016
me010|and you know the|D|Bed016
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah yeah.|B|Bed016
me010|and that the plan is to see to what extent the you'll get the same phenomena with stories about this.|S|Bed016
me010|so that|D|Bed016
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
me010|and that we're planning to do this.|S|Bed016
me010|um|F|Bed016
me010|which we are.|S|Bed016
me010|so that's one thing.|S|Bed016
me010|um|F|Bed016
me010|depends i mean there is a um whole language learning story.|S|Bed016
me010|okay?|Q|Bed016
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed016
me010|which|D|Bed016
me010|uh actually|D|Bed016
me010|even on your five layer slide you you've got an old one that that leaves that off.|S|Bed016
mn015|yeah i i i do have it here.|S|Bed016
fe004|huh.|B|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
mn015|um|F|Bed016
mn015|and of course you know the the big picture is this bit.|S|Bed016
me010|right.|B|Bed016
mn015|but you know it would|D|Bed016
mn015|but i don't think i i am capable of of pulling this off and doing justice to the matter.|S|Bed016
mn015|i mean there is interesting stuff in terms of how language works.|S|Bed016
mn015|so the emergentism story would be nice to be you know it would be nice to tell people.|S|Bed016
mn015|how what's happening there.|S|Bed016
mn015|plus how the uh language learning stuff works.|S|Bed016
me010|okay so so anyway i i agree that's not central.|S|Bed016
mn015|but|D|Bed016
me010|what you might want to do is|D|Bed016
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
me010|um|F|Bed016
me010|and may not.|S|Bed016
me010|but you might want to this is rip off a bunch of the slides on the|D|Bed016
me010|there the there we've got various generations of slides that show language analysis and matching to the underlying image schemas.|S|Bed016
me010|and|F|Bed016
me010|um how the construction and simulation|D|Bed016
me010|that that whole|D|Bed016
mn015|yeah that that's that comes up to the x schema slide.|S|Bed016
fe004|okay right.|S|Bed016
mn015|so basically i'm going to steal that from nancy.|S|Bed016
mn015|one of nancy's|D|Bed016
fe004|okay i can give you a more recent if you want.|S|Bed016
fe004|well that might have enough.|S|Bed016
mn015|uh i|D|Bed016
mn015|yeah but i also have stuff you trash you left over.|S|Bed016
me010|okay.|S|Bed016
mn015|your quals and your triple a i.|S|Bed016
me010|the quals the the the quals slides would be fine.|S|Bed016
fe004|yeah.|S|Bed016
me010|you could get it out of there or|D|Bed016
fe004|which i can even email you then.|S|Bed016
fe004|you know like there probably was a little few changes.|S|Bed016
fe004|not a big deal.|S|Bed016
fe004|yeah you could steal anything you want.|S|Bed016
fe004|i don't care.|S|Bed016
fe004|which you've already done obviously.|S|Bed016
fe004|so|F|Bed016
mn015|well i i don't feel bad about it at all.|S|Bed016
fe004|sorry.|S|Bed016
fe004|no you shouldn't.|S|Bed016
mn015|because because you are on the uh title.|S|Bed016
mn015|i mean on the the you're that's see that's you.|S|Bed016
fe004|oh that's great that's great.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
fe004|i'm glad to see propagation.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
fe004|huh!|B|Bed016
mn015|huh?|Q|Bed016
mn015|propagated?|Q|Bed016
fe004|yes.|S|Bed016
mn015|i mean i might even mention that this work you're doing is sort of also with the m p i in leipzig.|S|Bed016
mn015|so|F|Bed016
fe004|it's it's certainly related.|S|Bed016
fe004|um|F|Bed016
mn015|because um e m l is building up a huge thing in leipzig.|S|Bed016
fe004|might want to say.|S|Bed016
fe004|is it?|Q|Bed016
mn015|so it|D|Bed016
mn015|it's on biocomputation would|D|Bed016
me010|yeah it's different.|S|Bed016
me010|this is the uh d n a building or the double helix building.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed016
fe004|kind of a different level of analysis.|S|Bed016
me010|the yeah it was it turns out that if if you have multiple billions of dollars you can do all sorts of weird things.|S|Bed016
me010|and|D|Bed016
me003|wait they're building building in the shape of d n a?|S|Bed016
fe004|what?|Q|Bed016
me003|is that what you said?|Q|Bed016
me010|roughly yeah.|S|Bed016
me045|oh oh boy.|S|Bed016
me010|including cross bridges.|S|Bed016
me010|and|F|Bed016
fe004|what?|Q|Bed016
me045|that's brilliant!|S|Bed016
fe004|oh my god!|S|Bed016
me045|hhh.|B|Bed016
me010|you you really now i spent the last time i was there i spent maybe two hours hearing this story.|S|Bed016
me010|which is um|D|Bed016
fe004|of what?|Q|Bed016
me003|you definitely want to don't want to waste that money on research.|S|Bed016
fe004|the building.|S|Bed016
me003|you know?|Q|Bed016
me010|right.|S|Bed016
me003|that's horrible.|S|Bed016
me010|right.|B|Bed016
me010|well no no there's infinite money.|S|Bed016
me010|see.|S|Bed016
me010|you you you then fill it with researchers.|S|Bed016
fe004|and give them more money.|S|Bed016
fe004|they just want a fun place for them to to work.|S|Bed016
me010|right.|B|Bed016
me010|right.|B|Bed016
me045|and everybody gets a trampoline in their office.|S|Bed016
mn015|well the the offices are actually a little|D|Bed016
mn015|the|D|Bed016
mn015|think of um ramps coming out of the double helix.|S|Bed016
mn015|and then you have these half domes glass half domes.|S|Bed016
mn015|and the offices are in in the glass half dome.|S|Bed016
fe004|really?|Q|Bed016
me045|all right let's stop talking about this.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
fe004|does it exist yet?|Q|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
mn015|uh as a model.|S|Bed016
fe004|they are now building it?|Q|Bed016
fe004|huh.|S|Bed016
mn015|but i|D|Bed016
me010|so yeah i think that's that's a good point.|S|Bed016
me010|that the date the uh|D|Bed016
me010|a lot of the this is interacting with uh people in italy.|S|Bed016
me010|but also definitely the people in leipzig.|S|Bed016
me010|and|F|Bed016
me010|the|F|Bed016
me010|the the combination of the biology and the leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
me010|okay.|D|Bed016
me010|okay.|B|Bed016
me010|anyway enough of that.|S|Bed016
me010|let's talk about your thesis proposal.|S|Bed016
mn015|yeah if somebody has something to say.|S|Bed016
me010|yep.|S|Bed016
me045|you might want to uh double check the spellings of the authors' names on your references.|S|Bed016
me045|you had a few uh misspells in your slides there.|S|Bed016
me045|like i believe you had jackendorf.|S|Bed016
me010|um|F|Bed016
me045|uh unless there's a person called jackendorf.|S|Bed016
me010|no no no.|S|Bed016
me045|yeah.|B|Bed016
fe004|on that one?|Q|Bed016
me045|but that's the only thing i noticed in there.|S|Bed016
fe004|in the presentation?|Q|Bed016
me045|in the presentation.|S|Bed016
fe004|i'll probably i might have i'll probably have comments for you separately.|S|Bed016
fe004|not important.|S|Bed016
fe004|anyway|F|Bed016
mn015|oh in the presentation here.|S|Bed016
fe004|yeah that's what he was talking about.|S|Bed016
me045|yeah.|S|Bed016
mn015|i was actually worried about bibtex.|S|Bed016
mn015|uh no that's quite possible.|S|Bed016
mn015|that's copy and paste from something.|S|Bed016
me010|so i did|D|Bed016
me010|it looks like the uh metaphor didn't get in yet.|S|Bed016
mn015|uh it did.|S|Bed016
mn015|there is a reference to srini|D|Bed016
me010|well reference is one thing.|S|Bed016
me010|the question is is there any place|D|Bed016
me010|oh did you put in something about|D|Bed016
fe004|metonymy and metaphor here.|S|Bed016
fe004|right?|Q|Bed016
me010|uh the individual|D|Bed016
me010|we'd talked about putting in something about people had|D|Bed016
me010|uh|F|Bed016
me010|oh yeah okay.|S|Bed016
me010|good i see where you have it.|S|Bed016
me010|so the top of the second of page two you have a sentence.|S|Bed016
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
me010|but what i meant is i think even before you give this to wahlster uh you should|D|Bed016
me010|unless you put it in the text.|S|Bed016
me010|and i don't think it's there yet.|S|Bed016
me010|about we talked about is the um scalability that you get by um combining the constructions with the general construal mechanism.|S|Bed016
me010|is that in there?|Q|Bed016
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed016
mn015|huh um|F|Bed016
me010|uh okay so where where is it?|S|Bed016
me010|because i'll have to take a look.|S|Bed016
mn015|um but i i did not focus on that aspect.|S|Bed016
mn015|but um uh|F|Bed016
mn015|um it's just underneath uh um that reference to metaphor.|S|Bed016
mn015|so it's the last paragraph.|S|Bed016
mn015|before two.|S|Bed016
mn015|so on page two|D|Bed016
mn015|um the main focus|D|Bed016
me010|uh okay.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
mn015|but that's really|D|Bed016
fe004|that's not about that.|S|Bed016
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed016
fe004|is it?|Q|Bed016
me010|no it it it says it.|S|Bed016
me010|but it doesn't say it doesn't it it|D|Bed016
mn015|why.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah it doesn't give the punch line.|S|Bed016
mn015|uhhuh.|S|Bed016
me010|because let me tell the gang what i think the punch line is.|S|Bed016
me010|because it's actually important.|S|Bed016
me010|which is that the constructions that uh nancy and keith and friends are doing uh are in a way quite general.|S|Bed016
me010|but cover only base cases.|S|Bed016
me010|and to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things requires this additional mechanism of construal.|S|Bed016
me010|and the punch line is he claimed that if you do this right you can get essentially orthogonality.|S|Bed016
me010|that if you introduce a new construction at at the base level it should uh interact with all the metonymies and metaphors.|S|Bed016
me010|so that all of the projections of it also should work.|S|Bed016
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
me010|and similarly if you introduce a new metaphor it should then uh compose with all of the constructions.|S|Bed016
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
me045|yeah.|B|Bed016
me010|and it to the extent that that's true then then it's a big win over anything that exists.|S|Bed016
me003|so does that mean instead of having tons and tons of rules in your context free grammar you just have these base constructs and then a general mechanism for coercing them?|Q|Bed016
me045|yeah.|B|Bed016
me010|uhhuh.|S|Bed016
me010|so that you know for example uh in the metaphor case that you have a kind of direct idea of a source path and goal.|S|Bed016
me010|and any metaphorical one and abstract goals and all that sort of stuff you can do the same grammar.|S|Bed016
me010|and it is the same grammar.|S|Bed016
me003|huh.|B|Bed016
me010|but um|F|Bed016
me010|the trick is that the|D|Bed016
me010|the way the construction's written it requires that the object of the preposition for example be a container.|S|Bed016
me010|well trouble isn't a container.|S|Bed016
me010|but it gets construed as a container.|S|Bed016
me003|right.|B|Bed016
me010|et cetera.|S|Bed016
me010|so that's that's where this um|D|Bed016
me003|so with construal you don't have to have a construction for every possible thing that can fill the rule.|S|Bed016
me010|right.|S|Bed016
me010|so's it's it it's a very big deal in this framework.|S|Bed016
me010|and the thesis proposal as it stands doesn't|D|Bed016
me010|um i don't think say that as clearly as it could.|S|Bed016
mn015|no it doesn't say it at all no.|S|Bed016
mn015|even though one could argue what if there are basic cases even.|S|Bed016
mn015|i mean it seems like nothing is context free.|S|Bed016
me010|oh nothing is context free.|S|Bed016
me010|but there are basic cases.|S|Bed016
me010|that is um there are physical containers.|S|Bed016
me010|there are physical paths.|S|Bed016
me010|there|D|Bed016
me010|you know.|S|Bed016
me010|et cetera.|S|Bed016
mn015|but walked into the cafe and ordered a drink and walked into the cafe and broke his nose.|S|Bed016
mn015|that's sort of|D|Bed016
me010|oh it doesn't mean that they're unambiguous.|S|Bed016
me010|i mean a cafe can be construed as a container or it can be construed you know as as a obstacle.|S|Bed016
mn015|huh yeah.|B|Bed016
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
me010|or as some physical object.|S|Bed016
me010|so there are multiple construals.|S|Bed016
me010|and in fact that's part of what has to be done.|S|Bed016
me010|this is why there's this interaction between the analysis and the construal.|S|Bed016
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
mn015|yep.|B|Bed016
me010|the the the double arrow.|S|Bed016
mn015|yep.|B|Bed016
me010|so uh yeah i mean it doesn't magically make ambiguity go away.|S|Bed016
mn015|no.|B|Bed016
me010|but it does say that uh if you walked into the cafe and broke your nose then you are construing the cafe as an obstacle.|S|Bed016
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
me010|and if that's not consistent with other things then you've got to reject that reading.|S|Bed016
mn015|yep.|B|Bed016
me003|you con you conditioned me with your first sentence.|S|Bed016
me003|and so i thought why would he walk into the cafe and then somehow break his nose.|S|Bed016
me045|he slipped on the wet floor.|S|Bed016
me003|uh oh uh|F|Bed016
me010|right.|S|Bed016
mn015|you don't find that usage.|S|Bed016
mn015|uh uh i checked for it in the brown national corpus.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
mn015|the walk into it never really means as in walked smack|D|Bed016
me010|but run into does.|S|Bed016
mn015|yeah but if you find walked smacked into the cafe or slammed into the wall|D|Bed016
me010|yeah no but run into does.|S|Bed016
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
me010|because you will find run into|D|Bed016
me010|uh|F|Bed016
me003|cars run into telephone poles all the time.|S|Bed016
me010|well or into the cafe for that|D|Bed016
me010|you know.|S|Bed016
mn015|right.|B|Bed016
me010|his car ran into the cafe.|S|Bed016
mn015|yeah or you can run into an old friend or run.|S|Bed016
me010|well you can run into in that sense too.|S|Bed016
me010|but uh|F|Bed016
fe004|yeah run into might even be more impact sense than you know container sense.|S|Bed016
me010|right.|S|Bed016
me045|depends.|S|Bed016
me010|but like run into an old friend it probably needs its own construction.|S|Bed016
me010|i mean uh you know george would have i'm sure some complicated reason why it really was an instance of something else.|S|Bed016
fe004|uhhuh uhhuh.|B|Bed016
me010|and maybe it is.|S|Bed016
me010|but um|F|Bed016
me010|there are idioms.|S|Bed016
me010|and my guess is that's one of them.|S|Bed016
me010|but um i don't know.|S|Bed016
fe004|all contact.|S|Bed016
fe004|i mean there's contact that doesn't social contact.|S|Bed016
fe004|whatever.|S|Bed016
fe004|i mean|D|Bed016
me010|uh|F|Bed016
me045|sudden surprising contact.|S|Bed016
me045|right?|Q|Bed016
me010|yeah but it's it's it's it's right yeah it's more|D|Bed016
fe004|forceful.|S|Bed016
me045|but of course no.|S|Bed016
me045|i mean it has a life of its own.|S|Bed016
me045|it's sort of partially inspired by the spatial|D|Bed016
me010|well this is this motivated|D|Bed016
me010|but yeah.|S|Bed016
me045|yeah.|B|Bed016
me010|oh yeah for sure.|S|Bed016
me010|motivated.|S|Bed016
me010|but then you can't parse on motivated.|S|Bed016
me045|yeah.|B|Bed016
me045|yeah right.|S|Bed016
me010|uh|F|Bed016
fe004|too bad.|S|Bed016
me003|you should get a t shirt that says that.|S|Bed016
me010|okay.|S|Bed016
fe004|there's there's lots of things you could make t shirts out of.|S|Bed016
fe004|but uh|F|Bed016
fe004|this has gotten|D|Bed016
fe004|i mean|D|Bed016
fe004|we don't need the words to that.|S|Bed016
mn015|probably not your marks in the kitchen today.|S|Bed016
fe004|what?|Q|Bed016
mn015|not not your marks.|S|Bed016
fe004|oh no no no no no no no no no we're not going there.|S|Bed016
fe004|okay.|F|Bed016
me045|in other news.|F|Bed016
me010|okay so um|F|Bed016
me010|anything else you want to ask us about?|Q|Bed016
me010|the thesis proposal you got|D|Bed016
mn015|well|D|Bed016
me010|we could look at a particular thing and give you feedback on it.|S|Bed016
mn015|well there actually|D|Bed016
mn015|the what would have been really nice is to find an example for all of this uh from our domain.|S|Bed016
mn015|so maybe if we if we can make one up now that would be incredibly helpful.|S|Bed016
fe004|so where it should illustrate|D|Bed016
me010|okay.|S|Bed016
mn015|how|D|Bed016
fe004|uh when you say all this do you mean like i don't know the related work stuff?|Q|Bed016
fe004|as well as mappings?|Q|Bed016
me010|right right|F|Bed016
mn015|well we have for example a canonical use of something.|S|Bed016
mn015|and it's you know we have some constructions.|S|Bed016
mn015|and then it's construed as something.|S|Bed016
mn015|and then we we may get the same constructions with a metaphorical use that's also relevant to the to the domain.|S|Bed016
me010|okay let's let's suppose you use in and on.|S|Bed016
me010|i mean that's what you started with.|S|Bed016
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
me010|so in the bus and on the bus.|S|Bed016
me010|um that's actually a little tricky in english.|S|Bed016
me010|because to some extent they're synonyms.|S|Bed016
me010|okay.|S|Bed016
mn015|i had two hours with george on this.|S|Bed016
me010|okay what did he say?|S|Bed016
mn015|so it|D|Bed016
fe004|did you?|Q|Bed016
mn015|um um|F|Bed016
fe004|join the club.|S|Bed016
me010|right oh that's|D|Bed016
mn015|on the bus is a is a metaphorical metonymy.|S|Bed016
mn015|that relates some path metaphorically.|S|Bed016
mn015|and you're on on that path.|S|Bed016
mn015|and i mean it's he there's a platform notion.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah i i believe all that.|S|Bed016
me010|it's just|D|Bed016
mn015|right?|Q|Bed016
mn015|he's on the standing on the bus waving to me.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
mn015|but the regular as we speak johno was on the bus to new york.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
mn015|um uh|F|Bed016
mn015|he's|D|Bed016
mn015|that's uh|D|Bed016
mn015|what did i call it here?|Q|Bed016
mn015|the transportation schema something.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
mn015|where you can be on the first flight on the second flight.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah.|F|Bed016
mn015|and you can be you know on the wagon.|S|Bed016
me010|right so so that that may or may not be what you what you want to do.|S|Bed016
me010|i mean you could do something much simpler.|S|Bed016
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed016
me010|like under the bus or something.|S|Bed016
me010|where|D|Bed016
mn015|but it's it's unfortunately this is not really something a tourist would ever say.|S|Bed016
mn015|so|F|Bed016
me010|well unless he was repairing it or something.|S|Bed016
me010|but yeah.|S|Bed016
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed016
mn015|but um|F|Bed016
me010|uh but okay.|F|Bed016
mn015|so in terms of the this|D|Bed016
fe004|i see.|B|Bed016
mn015|we had we had initially we'd started discussing the out of film.|S|Bed016
me010|right.|B|Bed016
mn015|and there's a lot of out of analysis.|S|Bed016
mn015|so um|F|Bed016
me010|right.|B|Bed016
mn015|could we capture that?|Q|Bed016
mn015|with a different construal of|D|Bed016
fe004|yeah it's a little it's|D|Bed016
fe004|uh we've thought about it before uh uh to use the examples in other papers.|S|Bed016
fe004|and it's it's a little complicated.|S|Bed016
me045|out of out of film in particular.|S|Bed016
fe004|because you're like it's a state of there's resource.|S|Bed016
me045|yeah.|S|Bed016
fe004|right?|Q|Bed016
fe004|and like what is film?|Q|Bed016
fe004|the state you know you're out of the state of having film right and somehow film is standing for the the the state of having some resource is just labeled as that resource.|S|Bed016
me045|it's|D|Bed016
me045|yeah i mean|D|Bed016
fe004|i mean|D|Bed016
me045|but|D|Bed016
me045|and plus the fact that there's also|D|Bed016
fe004|it's a little bit|D|Bed016
me045|i mean can you say like the film ran out?|Q|Bed016
me045|you know.|S|Bed016
me045|or maybe you could say something like the film is out.|S|Bed016
fe004|yeah is film the trajector?|S|Bed016
me045|so like the the film went away from where it should be.|S|Bed016
me045|namely with you or something.|S|Bed016
me045|right?|Q|Bed016
me045|you know.|S|Bed016
me045|the the film the film is gone.|S|Bed016
me045|right?|Q|Bed016
me045|um|F|Bed016
me045|i never really knew what was going on.|S|Bed016
me045|i mean i i find it sort of a little bit farfetched to say that that i'm out of film means that i have left the state of having film or something like that.|S|Bed016
fe004|it's weird.|S|Bed016
fe004|that|D|Bed016
me045|but|F|Bed016
me010|uh.|B|Bed016
fe004|or having is also um associated with location.|S|Bed016
me045|yeah yeah.|S|Bed016
fe004|right?|Q|Bed016
fe004|so if the film left|D|Bed016
fe004|you know state is being near film.|S|Bed016
mn015|so running running out of something is different from being out of somewhere.|S|Bed016
me010|or being out of something as uh as well.|S|Bed016
me010|so running out of it definitely has a process aspect to it.|S|Bed016
fe004|uhhuh.|S|Bed016
fe004|but that's from run yeah.|S|Bed016
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
me010|so|F|Bed016
me010|that's okay.|S|Bed016
me010|i mean but the difference|D|Bed016
fe004|yeah.|S|Bed016
mn015|is the the final state of running out of something is being out of it.|S|Bed016
me010|is|D|Bed016
me045|yeah.|S|Bed016
me010|right.|S|Bed016
fe004|yeah so|D|Bed016
me045|you got there.|S|Bed016
fe004|that part is fine.|S|Bed016
me045|you got to out of it.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
me045|yeah.|B|Bed016
me010|but uh|F|Bed016
me045|huh!|S|Bed016
me010|yeah so so so no one has in in of the|D|Bed016
me010|uh|F|Bed016
me010|professional linguists.|S|Bed016
me010|they haven't|D|Bed016
fe004|uh|F|Bed016
me010|there was this whole thesis on out of.|S|Bed016
fe004|there was?|Q|Bed016
me010|well there i thought or there was a paper on it.|S|Bed016
fe004|who?|Q|Bed016
me045|out.|S|Bed016
me010|huh?|Q|Bed016
me045|there was one on on out or out of?|Q|Bed016
me010|there was|D|Bed016
me010|well it may be just out.|S|Bed016
me045|okay.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
me010|i think there was over.|S|Bed016
me010|but there was also a paper on out.|S|Bed016
me045|yeah susan lindner.|S|Bed016
me045|right?|Q|Bed016
me010|or something.|S|Bed016
fe004|oh yeah you're right yeah.|S|Bed016
me045|the the the syrup spread out.|S|Bed016
me045|that kind of thing?|Q|Bed016
me010|yeah and all that sort of stuff.|S|Bed016
fe004|yeah.|S|Bed016
fe004|and undoubtably there's been reams of work about it in cognitive linguistics.|S|Bed016
me010|okay but anyway we're not going to do that between now and next week.|S|Bed016
fe004|but|F|Bed016
fe004|yeah.|S|Bed016
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed016
me010|okay.|S|Bed016
me010|so um|F|Bed016
fe004|it's not one of the it's more straightforward ones forward ones to defend.|S|Bed016
fe004|so you probably don't want to use it for the purposes.|S|Bed016
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
me010|right.|B|Bed016
me010|okay.|D|Bed016
fe004|these are you're addressing like computational linguists.|S|Bed016
fe004|right?|Q|Bed016
fe004|or are you?|Q|Bed016
mn015|there's going to be four computational linguists.|S|Bed016
fe004|okay but more emphasis on the computational or emphasis on the linguist?|S|Bed016
mn015|it's|D|Bed016
mn015|more there's going to be the just four computational linguists by coincidence.|S|Bed016
mn015|but the rest is whatever biocomputing people and physicists.|S|Bed016
me010|no no no but not for your talk.|S|Bed016
fe004|oh okay.|S|Bed016
me010|we're worrying about the the|D|Bed016
mn015|oh the thesis.|S|Bed016
me010|it's just for one guy.|S|Bed016
fe004|oh i meant this.|S|Bed016
mn015|that's that's should be very computational.|S|Bed016
fe004|you know like|D|Bed016
fe004|okay.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
mn015|and uh|D|Bed016
fe004|so i would try to i would stay away from one that involves weird construal stuff.|S|Bed016
me045|yeah.|B|Bed016
me010|right.|S|Bed016
fe004|you know it's an obvious one.|S|Bed016
me045|totally weird stuff.|S|Bed016
mn015|i mean the the old bakery example might be nice.|S|Bed016
fe004|but uh|F|Bed016
mn015|is there a bakery around here?|Q|Bed016
me045|yeah.|S|Bed016
mn015|so if you we really just construe it as a|D|Bed016
fe004|around?|Q|Bed016
mn015|no it's the bakery itself.|S|Bed016
mn015|is it a building uh that you want to go to or is it something to eat that you want to buy?|Q|Bed016
fe004|oh.|S|Bed016
fe004|oh oh yeah yeah.|S|Bed016
fe004|we've thought about that.|S|Bed016
fe004|right right.|B|Bed016
mn015|and then|D|Bed016
fe004|nnn.|B|Bed016
fe004|no!|S|Bed016
fe004|what?|Q|Bed016
fe004|bakery can't be something you're going to eat.|S|Bed016
me010|no no the question is do you want to do you want to construe do you want to constr strue|D|Bed016
me003|it's a speech act.|S|Bed016
me010|exactly it's because do you want to do you want to view the bakery as a a place that that for example if|D|Bed016
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed016
fe004|where you can get baked goods.|S|Bed016
me010|well well that's one.|S|Bed016
me010|you want to buy something.|S|Bed016
me010|but the other is|D|Bed016
me010|uh you might have smelled a smell and are just curious about whether there'd be a bakery in the neighborhood.|S|Bed016
me010|or|F|Bed016
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
me010|um pfff|D|Bed016
me010|you know you wonder how people here make their living.|S|Bed016
me010|and there're all sorts of reasons why you might be asking about the existence of a bakery.|S|Bed016
me045|yeah.|B|Bed016
me010|that doesn't mean i want to buy some baked goods.|S|Bed016
fe004|okay.|S|Bed016
me010|but um|F|Bed016
me010|those are interesting examples.|S|Bed016
me010|but it's not clear that they're mainly construal examples.|S|Bed016
me045|yeah.|S|Bed016
fe004|so it's a lot of pragmatics there that|D|Bed016
mn015|huh.|B|Bed016
me010|there's all sorts of stuff going on.|S|Bed016
me010|so|F|Bed016
fe004|might be beyond what you want to do.|S|Bed016
me010|let's so let's think about this from the point of view of construal.|S|Bed016
me010|so let's first do a|D|Bed016
me010|so the metonymy thing is probably the easiest.|S|Bed016
me010|and and actually the|D|Bed016
me010|though the one you have isn't quite|D|Bed016
fe004|you mean the|D|Bed016
fe004|you mean the steak wants to pay?|Q|Bed016
me010|no not that one.|S|Bed016
me010|that's that's a the sort of background.|S|Bed016
me010|this is the uh page five.|S|Bed016
me003|about plato and the book?|Q|Bed016
me010|no.|S|Bed016
fe004|oh.|F|Bed016
mn015|no.|S|Bed016
fe004|um|B|Bed016
me045|onward.|S|Bed016
me010|just beyond that.|S|Bed016
fe004|how much does it cost?|Q|Bed016
mn015|where is the castle?|Q|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
me045|a castle.|S|Bed016
mn015|how old is it?|Q|Bed016
mn015|how much does it cost?|Q|Bed016
me003|oh.|B|Bed016
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
fe004|to go in.|S|Bed016
fe004|that's like|D|Bed016
me045|two hundred million dollars.|S|Bed016
me010|right.|S|Bed016
me010|it's not for sale.|S|Bed016
me010|uh so|F|Bed016
me045|yeah i think that's a good example actually.|S|Bed016
fe004|yeah that's good.|S|Bed016
mn015|but as nancy just suggested it's probably ellipticus.|S|Bed016
fe004|ellipsis.|S|Bed016
mn015|huh|B|Bed016
fe004|like it doesn't refer to thing.|S|Bed016
fe004|it refers to you know|D|Bed016
fe004|thing standing for most relevant activity for a tourist.|S|Bed016
fe004|you could think of it that way.|S|Bed016
fe004|but|F|Bed016
me010|yeah.|S|Bed016
me045|well shoot!|S|Bed016
me045|isn't that i mean that's what|D|Bed016
mn015|well i mean my argument here is it's it's it's the same thing as plato's on the top shelf.|S|Bed016
me045|figuring that out is what this is about.|S|Bed016
fe004|yeah yeah no i agree.|S|Bed016
mn015|i'm|D|Bed016
mn015|you know that you can refer to a book of plato by using plato.|S|Bed016
fe004|yeah.|S|Bed016
mn015|and you can refer back to it.|S|Bed016
fe004|no no i i'm agreeing that this is a good um|D|Bed016
mn015|and so you can castles have as tourist sites have admission fees.|S|Bed016
mn015|so you can say where is the castle.|S|Bed016
mn015|how much does it cost.|S|Bed016
mn015|um|F|Bed016
mn015|how far is it from here.|S|Bed016
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
mn015|so|F|Bed016
mn015|you're also not referring to the width of the object or so.|S|Bed016
fe004|huh.|B|Bed016
mn015|www.|B|Bed016
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
me045|huh.|B|Bed016
me010|okay can we think of a nice metaphorical use of where in the tourist's domain|D|Bed016
me010|um|F|Bed016
me045|huh.|B|Bed016
me010|so you know it's|D|Bed016
me010|you you can sometimes use where for when.|S|Bed016
me010|in the sense of you know|D|Bed016
me010|um|F|Bed016
me010|where where where was um|D|Bed016
me010|where was heidelberg um in the thirty years' war?|Q|Bed016
me010|or something.|S|Bed016
me045|uh yeah.|S|Bed016
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
me010|you know or some such thing.|S|Bed016
me010|um|B|Bed016
me045|like what side were they on?|Q|Bed016
me045|or|D|Bed016
fe004|what?|Q|Bed016
me010|yeah essentially yeah.|S|Bed016
fe004|okay i was like huh.|S|Bed016
fe004|it was here.|S|Bed016
fe004|like um|F|Bed016
me010|but anyway so there are there are cases like that.|S|Bed016
me010|um|F|Bed016
fe004|uh.|B|Bed016
fe004|or like its developmental state or something like that.|S|Bed016
fe004|you could i guess you could get that.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
me010|um.|F|Bed016
fe004|um.|F|Bed016
me045|i mean there's also things like i mean|D|Bed016
me045|um|F|Bed016
me045|i guess i could ask something like where can i find out about blah blah blah.|S|Bed016
me045|in a sort of|D|Bed016
me045|doesn't i don't necessarily have to care about the spatial location.|S|Bed016
me045|just give me a phone number.|S|Bed016
me045|and i'll call them or something like that.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah there certainly is that yeah.|S|Bed016
me010|you know where could i learn its opening hours or something.|S|Bed016
me045|yeah.|S|Bed016
me010|but that's not metaphorical.|S|Bed016
fe004|huh.|B|Bed016
me010|it's another|D|Bed016
me045|yeah.|S|Bed016
me010|so we're thinking about um|D|Bed016
me010|or we could also think about|D|Bed016
me010|uh|F|Bed016
mn015|well i i i|D|Bed016
me010|how about i'm in a hurry?|Q|Bed016
fe004|state.|S|Bed016
me010|it but it's a state and the the issue is is that it may be just a usage.|S|Bed016
me045|huh.|B|Bed016
me010|you know that it's not particularly metaphorical.|S|Bed016
me010|i don't know.|S|Bed016
me045|huh.|B|Bed016
fe004|right.|B|Bed016
fe004|so you want a more exotic one version of that.|S|Bed016
me045|oh.|F|Bed016
me010|yeah yeah right.|S|Bed016
me010|uh!|S|Bed016
me010|how about|D|Bed016
fe004|i'm really into|D|Bed016
me010|i i i you know i'm in i'm in a state of exhaustion.|S|Bed016
me010|or something like that.|S|Bed016
fe004|do you really say that?|Q|Bed016
me010|which a tourist|D|Bed016
me010|huh?|Q|Bed016
fe004|would you really say that?|Q|Bed016
me010|a uh well you can certainly say um you know i'm in overload.|S|Bed016
me045|yeah.|S|Bed016
me010|tourists will often say that.|S|Bed016
me003|i'm really into art.|S|Bed016
fe004|yeah i was going to say like|D|Bed016
me003|uh|F|Bed016
me010|oh you can do that?|Q|Bed016
me010|really?|Q|Bed016
me010|of course that's that that's definitely a uh|D|Bed016
me045|fixed.|S|Bed016
fe004|a fixed expression yeah.|S|Bed016
me010|that's a uh|D|Bed016
me010|right but|D|Bed016
fe004|there're too there're all sorts of fixed expressions.|S|Bed016
fe004|i don't like uh|D|Bed016
fe004|i'm out of sorts now.|S|Bed016
me010|right.|B|Bed016
fe004|like i'm in trouble.|S|Bed016
mn015|well i when uh just|D|Bed016
mn015|the data that i've looked at so far that|D|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
mn015|i mean there's tons of cases for polysemy.|S|Bed016
me010|right.|B|Bed016
mn015|so you know making reference to buildings as institutions as containers as|D|Bed016
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
me010|right.|B|Bed016
mn015|you know whatever.|S|Bed016
mn015|um so in for example in museums you know as a building or as something where pictures hang versus you know something that puts on exhibits.|S|Bed016
me010|right as an institution.|S|Bed016
mn015|so forth.|S|Bed016
mn015|but|F|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
mn015|um.|F|Bed016
fe004|why don't you want to use any of those?|Q|Bed016
mn015|huh?|Q|Bed016
fe004|so you don't want to use one that's|D|Bed016
mn015|yeah well|D|Bed016
mn015|no but this|D|Bed016
mn015|that's what i have you know started doing.|S|Bed016
me010|the castle the that old castle one is sort of|D|Bed016
mn015|metonymy polysemy.|S|Bed016
me003|i love van gogh.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
me010|uh!|D|Bed016
fe004|i want to go see the van gogh.|S|Bed016
me045|oh geez.|S|Bed016
fe004|anyway i'm sorry.|S|Bed016
mn015|but i think the argument should be uh can be made that you know despite the fact that this is not the most metaphorical domain|D|Bed016
mn015|because people interacting with h t i systems try to be straightforward and less lyrical|D|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
mn015|construal still is uh you know completely um key in terms of finding out any of these things.|S|Bed016
mn015|so um|F|Bed016
me010|right.|S|Bed016
me010|so that's that's that's a that's a reasonable point.|S|Bed016
me010|that it in this domain you're going to get less metaphor and more metonymy.|S|Bed016
mn015|we uh i with a i looked with a student i looked at the entire database that we have on heidelberg for cases of metonymy.|S|Bed016
me010|and polysemy and stuff like that.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
mn015|hardly anything.|S|Bed016
mn015|so not even in descriptions did we find anything um relevant.|S|Bed016
me045|i have to go.|S|Bed016
me010|all right yeah.|S|Bed016
mn015|but okay this is just something we'll we'll see.|S|Bed016
mn015|um|F|Bed016
me010|right.|S|Bed016
me010|see you.|S|Bed016
mn015|and deal with.|S|Bed016
me010|okay well i guess if anybody has additional suggestions|D|Bed016
mn015|i mean maybe the where is something question as a whole you know can be construed as locational versus instructional request.|S|Bed016
me010|yeah.|S|Bed016
mn015|so if we're not talk about the|D|Bed016
fe004|location versus what?|Q|Bed016
mn015|instruction.|S|Bed016
fe004|instruction oh directions yeah.|S|Bed016
me010|sure.|B|Bed016
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed016
fe004|oh i thought that was definitely treated as an example of construal.|S|Bed016
fe004|right?|Q|Bed016
mn015|yeah but then you're not on the lexical level.|S|Bed016
mn015|that's sort of one level higher.|S|Bed016
fe004|oh you want a lexical example.|S|Bed016
mn015|but i don't need it.|S|Bed016
me010|well you might want both.|S|Bed016
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed016
mn015|also it would be nice to get ultimately to get a nice mental space example.|S|Bed016
me010|we|D|Bed016
mn015|so even temporal references are|D|Bed016
mn015|just in the spatial domain are rare.|S|Bed016
me010|but it's it's easy to make up plausible ones.|S|Bed016
me010|you know?|Q|Bed016
mn015|when when you're getting information on objects.|S|Bed016
me010|right.|S|Bed016
mn015|so i mean|D|Bed016
me010|you know you know where|D|Bed016
me010|yeah.|B|Bed016
me010|what color was this in in in the nineteenth century?|Q|Bed016
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed016
me010|what was this|D|Bed016
me010|instead of what you know how was this painted.|S|Bed016
me010|what color was this painted?|Q|Bed016
me010|um|F|Bed016
me010|was this alleyway open?|Q|Bed016
mn015|yeah maybe we can include that also in our second uh data run.|S|Bed016
me010|uh|F|Bed016
mn015|we we can show people pictures of objects.|S|Bed016
mn015|and then have then ask the system about the objects.|S|Bed016
mn015|and engage in conversation on the history and the art and the architecture and so forth.|S|Bed016
me010|uhhuh.|B|Bed016
me010|okay so why don't we plan to give you feedback electronically.|S|Bed016
me010|wish you a good trip.|S|Bed016
me010|all success.|S|Bed016
me003|for some reason when you said feedback electronically i thought of that|D|Bed016
me003|you ever see the simpsons where they're like the family's got the buzzers?|Q|Bed016
me003|and they buzz each other when they don't like what the other one is saying.|S|Bed016
fe004|yeah that's the first one i think.|S|Bed016
me003|it was a very early one.|S|Bed016
fe004|the very very first one.|S|Bed016
me003|i don't know if it's the first one.|S|Bed016
fe004|huh.|B|Bed016
fe004|huh.|B|Bed016
