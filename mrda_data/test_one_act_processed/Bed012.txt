mn015|so i guess this is more or less now just to get you up to date johno.|S|Bed012
mn015|this is what uh|D|Bed012
me003|this is a meeting for me.|S|Bed012
mn015|um|F|Bed012
mn015|eva bhaskara and i did.|S|Bed012
fn050|did you add more stuff to it later?|Q|Bed012
mn015|um why?|Q|Bed012
fn050|um i don't know.|S|Bed012
fn050|there were like the you know and all that stuff.|S|Bed012
fn050|but i thought you you said you were adding stuff.|S|Bed012
fn050|but i don't know.|S|Bed012
mn015|uh no.|S|Bed012
mn015|this is|D|Bed012
mn015|um|F|Bed012
mn015|ha!|S|Bed012
mn015|very nice.|S|Bed012
mn015|um so we thought that we can write up uh an element.|S|Bed012
mn015|and for each of the situation nodes that we observed in the bayes net.|S|Bed012
mn015|so|F|Bed012
mn015|what's the situation like at the entity that is mentioned?|Q|Bed012
mn015|if we know anything about it.|S|Bed012
mn015|is it under construction?|Q|Bed012
mn015|or is it on fire or something happening to it?|Q|Bed012
mn015|or is it stable?|Q|Bed012
mn015|and so forth.|S|Bed012
mn015|going all the way um through parking location hotel car restroom riots fairs strikes or disasters.|S|Bed012
me003|so is this is a situation are is all the things which can be happening right now?|Q|Bed012
me003|or what is the situation type?|Q|Bed012
mn015|that's basically just specifying the the input for the what's|D|Bed012
me003|oh i see.|S|Bed012
me003|why are you specifying it in x m l?|Q|Bed012
mn015|um just because it forces us to be specific about the values here.|S|Bed012
me003|okay.|S|Bed012
mn015|and also i mean this is a what the input is going to be.|S|Bed012
mn015|right?|Q|Bed012
mn015|so we will uh|D|Bed012
mn015|this is a schema this is|D|Bed012
me003|well yeah i just don't know if this is what the does this is what java bayes takes as a bayes net spec?|Q|Bed012
mn015|no because i mean if we i mean we're sure going to interface to we're going to get an x m l document from somewhere.|S|Bed012
mn015|right?|Q|Bed012
mn015|and that x m l document will say we are able to we were able to observe that the element um of the location that the car is near.|S|Bed012
mn015|so that's going to be um|D|Bed012
me003|so this is the situational context everything in it.|S|Bed012
me003|is that what situation is short for?|Q|Bed012
me003|situational context?|Q|Bed012
mn015|yep.|S|Bed012
me003|okay.|S|Bed012
mn015|so this is just again an x m l schemata which defines a set of possible uh permissible x m l structures.|S|Bed012
mn015|which we view as input into the bayes net.|S|Bed012
mn015|right?|Q|Bed012
me003|and then we can uh possibly run one of them uh transformations?|Q|Bed012
me003|that put it into the format that the bayes or java bayes or whatever wants.|S|Bed012
mn015|are you talking are you talking about the the structure?|Q|Bed012
me003|well it|D|Bed012
mn015|i mean when you observe a node.|S|Bed012
me003|when you when you say the input to the java bayes it takes a certain format.|S|Bed012
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed012
me003|right?|Q|Bed012
me003|which i don't think is this.|S|Bed012
me003|although i don't know.|S|Bed012
mn015|no it's certainly not this.|S|Bed012
mn015|nuh.|S|Bed012
me003|so you could just couldn't you just run a|D|Bed012
mn015|x s l yeah.|S|Bed012
me003|yeah.|S|Bed012
me003|to convert it into the java bayes format?|Q|Bed012
mn015|yep.|S|Bed012
me003|okay.|S|Bed012
mn015|that's that's no problem.|S|Bed012
mn015|but i even think that um|D|Bed012
mn015|i mean once once you have this sort of as running as a module|D|Bed012
mn015|right?|Q|Bed012
mn015|what you want is you want to say okay give me the posterior probabilities of the go there node when this is happening.|S|Bed012
mn015|right?|Q|Bed012
mn015|when the person said this the car is there it's raining and this is happening.|S|Bed012
mn015|and with this you can specify the what's happening in the situation and what's happening with the user.|S|Bed012
mn015|so we get after we are done through the situation we get the user vector.|S|Bed012
mn015|so this is a|D|Bed012
me003|so this is just a specification of all the possible inputs?|Q|Bed012
mn015|yep.|S|Bed012
mn015|and|F|Bed012
mn015|all the possible outputs too.|S|Bed012
me003|okay.|S|Bed012
mn015|so we have um for example the uh go there decision node.|S|Bed012
mn015|which has two elements.|S|Bed012
mn015|going there and its posterior probability.|S|Bed012
mn015|and not going there and its posterior probability.|S|Bed012
mn015|because the output is always going to be all the decision nodes and all the the all the posterior probabilities for all the values.|S|Bed012
me003|and then we would just look at the uh struct that we want to look at?|Q|Bed012
me003|in terms of if if we're only asking about one of the|D|Bed012
me003|so like if i'm just interested in the going there node i would just pull that information out of the struct that gets that would that java bayes would output?|Q|Bed012
mn015|um pretty much yes.|S|Bed012
mn015|but i think it's a little bit more complex.|S|Bed012
mn015|as if i understand it correctly it always gives you all the posterior probabilities for all the values of all decision nodes.|S|Bed012
mn015|so when we input something we always get the uh posterior probabilities for all of these.|S|Bed012
mn015|right?|Q|Bed012
me003|okay.|S|Bed012
mn015|so there is no way of telling it not to tell us about the eva values.|S|Bed012
me003|yeah wait i agree.|S|Bed012
me003|that's yeah use oh uh yeah okay.|S|Bed012
mn015|so so we get this whole list of of um things.|S|Bed012
mn015|and the question is what to do with it.|S|Bed012
mn015|what to hand on.|S|Bed012
mn015|how to interpret it.|S|Bed012
mn015|in a sense.|S|Bed012
mn015|so you said if you i'm only interested in whether he wants to go there or not then i just look at that node.|S|Bed012
mn015|look which one|D|Bed012
me003|look at that struct in the output?|Q|Bed012
me003|right?|Q|Bed012
mn015|yep.|S|Bed012
mn015|look at that struct in the the output.|S|Bed012
mn015|even though i wouldn't call it a struct.|S|Bed012
mn015|but|F|Bed012
me003|well well it's an x m l structure that's being returned.|S|Bed012
mn015|oh uhhuh.|S|Bed012
me003|right?|Q|Bed012
mn015|so every part of a structure is a struct.|S|Bed012
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed012
me003|yeah i just uh i just was abbreviated it to struct in my head and started going with that.|S|Bed012
mn015|that element or object i would say.|S|Bed012
me003|not a c struct that's not what i was trying to|D|Bed012
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed012
me003|though yeah.|S|Bed012
mn015|okay.|F|Bed012
mn015|and um|F|Bed012
mn015|the reason is why i think it's a little bit more complex or why why we can even think about it as an interesting problem in and of itself is|D|Bed012
mn015|um|F|Bed012
mn015|so the uh|D|Bed012
mn015|let's look at an example.|S|Bed012
me003|well wouldn't we just take the structure that's outputted and then run another transformation on it that would just dump the one that we wanted out?|Q|Bed012
mn015|yeah we'd need to prune.|S|Bed012
mn015|right?|Q|Bed012
mn015|throw things away.|S|Bed012
me003|well actually you don't even need to do that with x m l.|S|Bed012
me003|can't you just look at one specific|D|Bed012
mn015|yeah exactly the xerxes allows you to say just give me the value of that and that and that.|S|Bed012
mn015|but we don't really know what we're interested in before we look at the complete at at the overall result.|S|Bed012
mn015|so the person said um where is x.|S|Bed012
mn015|and so|F|Bed012
mn015|we want to know um is does he want info.|S|Bed012
mn015|on this.|S|Bed012
mn015|or know the location.|S|Bed012
mn015|or does he want to go there.|S|Bed012
mn015|let's assume this is our our question.|S|Bed012
me003|sure.|S|Bed012
mn015|nuh?|Q|Bed012
mn015|so|F|Bed012
mn015|um|F|Bed012
mn015|do this in perl.|S|Bed012
mn015|so we get|D|Bed012
mn015|okay.|B|Bed012
mn015|let's assume this is the output.|S|Bed012
mn015|so|F|Bed012
mn015|we should be able to conclude from that that|D|Bed012
mn015|i mean it's always going to give us a value of how likely we think it is that he wants to go there and doesn't want to go there.|S|Bed012
mn015|or how likely it is that he wants to get information.|S|Bed012
mn015|but maybe we should just reverse this to make it a little bit more delicate.|S|Bed012
mn015|so does he want to know where it is or does he want to go there?|Q|Bed012
me003|he wants to know where it is.|S|Bed012
mn015|right.|S|Bed012
mn015|i i i tend to agree.|S|Bed012
mn015|and if it's if|D|Bed012
me003|well now i mean you could|D|Bed012
mn015|and if there's sort of a clear winner here|D|Bed012
mn015|and um and this is pretty uh indifferent|D|Bed012
mn015|then we then we might conclude that he actually wants to just know where uh uh he does want to go there.|S|Bed012
me003|uh out of curiosity is there a reason why we wouldn't combine these three nodes into one smaller subnet?|Q|Bed012
me003|that would just basically be the question for|D|Bed012
me003|we have where is x is the question.|S|Bed012
me003|right?|Q|Bed012
me003|that would just be info on or location?|Q|Bed012
me003|based upon|D|Bed012
mn015|or go there.|S|Bed012
mn015|a lot of people ask that if they actually just want to go there.|S|Bed012
mn015|people come up to you on campus and say where's the library.|S|Bed012
mn015|you're going to say you're going to say go down that way.|S|Bed012
mn015|you're not going to say it's it's five hundred yards away from you or it's north of you or it's located|D|Bed012
me003|well i mean but the there's so you just have three decisions for the final node that would link these three nodes in the net together.|S|Bed012
mn015|um|F|Bed012
mn015|i don't know whether i understand what you mean.|S|Bed012
mn015|but again in this given this input we also in some situations may want to postulate an opinion whether that person wants to go there now.|S|Bed012
mn015|the nicest way.|S|Bed012
mn015|use a cab.|S|Bed012
mn015|or so|D|Bed012
mn015|wants to know it wants to know where it is because he wants something fixed there because he wants to visit it or whatever.|S|Bed012
mn015|so it i mean all i'm saying is whatever our input is we're always going to get the full output.|S|Bed012
mn015|and some some things will always be sort of too not significant enough.|S|Bed012
me003|or or it'll be tight.|S|Bed012
me003|you won't it'll be hard to decide.|S|Bed012
mn015|yep.|S|Bed012
me003|but i mean i guess i guess the thing is uh this is another smaller case of reasoning in the case of an uncertainty.|S|Bed012
me003|which makes me think bayes net should be the way to solve these things.|S|Bed012
me003|so if you had if for every construction|D|Bed012
me003|right?|Q|Bed012
mn015|oh!|S|Bed012
me003|you could say well there here's the where is construction.|S|Bed012
me003|and for the where is construction we know we need to look at this node that merges these three things together.|S|Bed012
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed012
me003|as for to decide the response.|S|Bed012
me003|and since we have a finite number of constructions that we can deal with we could have a finite number of nodes.|S|Bed012
mn015|okay.|S|Bed012
me003|say if we had to deal with arbitrary language it wouldn't make any sense to do that.|S|Bed012
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed012
me003|because there'd be no way to generate the nodes for every possible sentence.|S|Bed012
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed012
me003|but since we can only deal with a finite amount of stuff|D|Bed012
mn015|so basically the idea is to to feed the output of that belief net into another belief net.|S|Bed012
me003|yeah so basically take these three things and then put them into another belief net.|S|Bed012
mn015|but why why why only those three?|Q|Bed012
mn015|why not the|D|Bed012
me003|well i mean for the where is question.|S|Bed012
me003|so we'd have a node for the where is question.|S|Bed012
mn015|yeah but we believe that all the decision nodes are can be relevant for the where is|D|Bed012
mn015|and the where how do i get to.|S|Bed012
mn015|or the tell me something about.|S|Bed012
me003|you can come in if you want.|S|Bed012
mn015|yes it is allowed.|S|Bed012
me003|as long as you're not wearing your your headphones.|S|Bed012
me003|well i i see i don't know if this is a good idea or not.|S|Bed012
me003|i'm just throwing it out.|S|Bed012
me003|but uh it seems like we could have i or uh we could put all of all of the information that could also be relevant into the where is node answer.|S|Bed012
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed012
mn015|yep.|S|Bed012
me003|node.|S|Bed012
me003|thing.|S|Bed012
me003|stuff.|S|Bed012
me003|and uh|F|Bed012
fn050|okay.|B|Bed012
mn015|i mean|F|Bed012
mn015|let's not forget we're going to get some very strong input from these from these discourse things.|S|Bed012
mn015|right?|Q|Bed012
mn015|so|F|Bed012
mn015|tell me the location of x.|S|Bed012
mn015|nuh?|Q|Bed012
mn015|or where is x located at.|S|Bed012
me003|we|D|Bed012
mn015|nuh?|Q|Bed012
me003|yeah i know but the bayes net would be able to the weights on the on the nodes in the bayes net would be able to do all that.|S|Bed012
me003|wouldn't it?|Q|Bed012
mn015|uhhuh.|S|Bed012
me003|here's a|D|Bed012
me003|oh!|S|Bed012
me003|oh i'll wait until you're plugged in.|S|Bed012
me003|oh don't sit there.|S|Bed012
me003|sit here.|S|Bed012
me003|you know how you don't like that one.|S|Bed012
me003|it's okay.|S|Bed012
me003|that's the weird one.|S|Bed012
me003|that's the one that's painful that hurts it hurts so bad.|S|Bed012
me003|i'm i'm happy that they're recording that.|S|Bed012
me003|that headphone the headphone that you have to put on backwards with the little little thing and the little little foam block on it.|S|Bed012
me003|it's a painful painful microphone.|S|Bed012
mn015|i think it's called the crown.|S|Bed012
me003|the crown.|S|Bed012
fn050|what?|Q|Bed012
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed012
mn015|versus the sony.|S|Bed012
me012|the crown?|Q|Bed012
me012|is that the actual name?|Q|Bed012
mn015|uhhuh.|S|Bed012
me012|okay.|S|Bed012
mn015|the manufacturer.|S|Bed012
me003|i don't see a manufacturer on it.|S|Bed012
me003|oh wait.|S|Bed012
mn015|you|D|Bed012
me003|here it is.|S|Bed012
me003|this thingy.|S|Bed012
me003|yeah it's the crown.|S|Bed012
me003|the crown of pain.|S|Bed012
me012|yes.|S|Bed012
mn015|you're online?|Q|Bed012
me003|are you are your mike is your mike on?|Q|Bed012
me012|indeed.|S|Bed012
me003|okay.|S|Bed012
me003|so you've been working with these guys.|S|Bed012
me003|you know what's going on?|Q|Bed012
me012|yes.|S|Bed012
me012|i have.|S|Bed012
me012|and i do.|S|Bed012
me012|yeah all right.|S|Bed012
me003|excellent!|S|Bed012
me012|so where are we?|Q|Bed012
mn015|we're discussing this.|S|Bed012
me012|i don't think it can handle french.|S|Bed012
me012|but anyway.|S|Bed012
mn015|so|F|Bed012
mn015|assume we have something coming in.|S|Bed012
mn015|a person says where is x.|S|Bed012
mn015|and we get a certain we have a situation vector and a user vector and everything is fine.|S|Bed012
mn015|and and our and our|D|Bed012
me003|did you just did you just stick the the the the microphone actually in the tea?|Q|Bed012
me012|no.|S|Bed012
mn015|and um|F|Bed012
me012|i'm not drinking tea.|S|Bed012
me012|what are you talking about?|Q|Bed012
me003|oh yeah.|S|Bed012
me003|sorry.|S|Bed012
mn015|let's just assume our bayes net just has three decision nodes for the time being.|S|Bed012
mn015|these three he wants to know something about it he wants to know where it is he wants to go there.|S|Bed012
me003|in terms of these would be how we would answer the question where is.|S|Bed012
me003|right?|Q|Bed012
me003|we|D|Bed012
me003|this is that's what you it seemed like explained it to me earlier.|S|Bed012
me003|we we're we want to know how to answer the question where is x.|S|Bed012
mn015|yeah but huh|D|Bed012
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed012
mn015|no i can i can do the timing node in here too.|S|Bed012
mn015|and say okay|S|Bed012
me003|well yeah but in the uh let's just deal with the the simple case of we're not worrying about timing or anything.|S|Bed012
me003|we just want to know how we should answer where is x.|S|Bed012
mn015|okay.|S|Bed012
mn015|and um|F|Bed012
mn015|okay and|F|Bed012
mn015|go there has two values.|S|Bed012
mn015|right?|Q|Bed012
mn015|go there and not go there.|S|Bed012
mn015|let's assume those are the posterior probabilities of that.|S|Bed012
me012|uhhuh.|B|Bed012
mn015|info on has true or false and location.|S|Bed012
mn015|so he wants to know something about it.|S|Bed012
mn015|and he wants to know something he wants to know where it is.|S|Bed012
me012|excuse me.|S|Bed012
mn015|has these values.|S|Bed012
mn015|and um|F|Bed012
me003|oh i see why we can't do that.|S|Bed012
mn015|and um in this case we would probably all agree that he wants to go there.|S|Bed012
mn015|our belief net thinks he wants to go there.|S|Bed012
mn015|right?|Q|Bed012
me012|yeah.|B|Bed012
me012|uhhuh.|S|Bed012
mn015|in the uh whatever.|S|Bed012
mn015|if we have something like this here.|S|Bed012
mn015|and|F|Bed012
mn015|this like that ..|S|Bed012
mn015|and maybe here also some|D|Bed012
me012|you should probably make them out of|D|Bed012
me012|yeah.|B|Bed012
me003|well it|D|Bed012
mn015|something like that.|S|Bed012
mn015|then we would guess aha he our belief net has stronger beliefs that he wants to know where it is than actually wants to go there.|S|Bed012
mn015|right?|Q|Bed012
me003|that it doesn't this assume though that they're evenly weighted?|Q|Bed012
fn050|true.|S|Bed012
me003|like|D|Bed012
me003|i guess they are evenly weighted.|S|Bed012
me012|the different decision nodes you mean?|Q|Bed012
me003|yeah the go there the info on and the location.|S|Bed012
me012|well yeah this is making the assumption.|S|Bed012
me012|yes.|S|Bed012
mn015|what do you mean by differently weighted?|Q|Bed012
me003|like|D|Bed012
mn015|they don't feed into anything really anymore.|S|Bed012
me003|or i|D|Bed012
me012|but i mean why do we|D|Bed012
me012|if we trusted the go there node more much more than we trusted the other ones then we would conclude even in this situation that he wanted to go there.|S|Bed012
me012|so in that sense we weight them equally.|S|Bed012
mn015|okay.|S|Bed012
me012|right now.|S|Bed012
mn015|makes sense.|S|Bed012
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed012
me003|so but i guess the question that i was wondering or maybe robert was proposing to me is|D|Bed012
mn015|but|D|Bed012
me003|how do we make the decision on as to which one to listen to?|Q|Bed012
me012|yeah so the final decision is the combination of these three.|S|Bed012
me012|so again it's it's some kind of uh|D|Bed012
me003|bayes net.|S|Bed012
me012|yeah sure.|S|Bed012
me003|okay so then the question so then my question is to you then would be|D|Bed012
me003|so is the only reason we can make all these smaller bayes nets because we know we can only deal with a finite set of constructions?|Q|Bed012
me003|because if we're just taking arbitrary language in we couldn't have a node for every possible question.|S|Bed012
me003|you know?|Q|Bed012
me012|a decision node for every possible question you mean.|S|Bed012
me003|well i like in the case of yeah.|S|Bed012
me003|in the any piece of language we wouldn't be able to answer it with this system if we just|D|Bed012
me003|because we wouldn't have the correct node.|S|Bed012
me003|basically what you're proposing is a where is node.|S|Bed012
me003|right?|Q|Bed012
me012|yeah.|S|Bed012
me003|and and if we and if someone says you know uh something in mandarin to the system wouldn't know which node to look at to answer that question.|S|Bed012
me012|so is|D|Bed012
me012|yeah.|B|Bed012
me003|right?|Q|Bed012
me012|yeah.|S|Bed012
mn015|huh|F|Bed012
me003|so but but if we have a finite|D|Bed012
me003|what?|Q|Bed012
mn015|i don't see your point.|S|Bed012
mn015|what what what i am thinking or what we're about to propose here is we're always going to get the whole list of values and their posterior probabilities.|S|Bed012
mn015|and now we need an expert system or belief net or something that interprets that ..|S|Bed012
mn015|that looks at all the values and says the winner is timing.|S|Bed012
mn015|now go there.|S|Bed012
mn015|uh go there timing now.|S|Bed012
mn015|or the winner is info on function off.|S|Bed012
mn015|so he wants to know something about it and what it does.|S|Bed012
mn015|nuh?|Q|Bed012
mn015|uh regardless of of of the input|D|Bed012
me003|yeah but but how does the expert but how does the expert system know which one to declare the winner if it doesn't know the question it is and how that question should be answered?|Q|Bed012
mn015|based on the what the question was so what the discourse the ontology the situation and the user model gave us we came up with these values for these decisions.|S|Bed012
me003|yeah i know but how do we weight what we get out?|S|Bed012
me003|as which one which ones are important.|S|Bed012
me003|so my so if we were to it with a bayes net we'd have to have a node for every question that we knew how to deal with.|S|Bed012
me003|that would take all of the inputs and weight them appropriately for that question.|S|Bed012
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed012
me003|does that make sense?|Q|Bed012
me003|yay?|Q|Bed012
me003|nay?|Q|Bed012
me012|um i mean are you saying that what happens if you try to scale this up to the situation or are we just dealing with arbitrary language?|Q|Bed012
me003|we|D|Bed012
me012|is that your point?|Q|Bed012
me003|well no i i guess my question is is the reason that we can make a node|D|Bed012
me003|or okay so let me see if i'm confused.|S|Bed012
me003|are we going to make a node for every question?|Q|Bed012
me003|does that make sense?|Q|Bed012
me003|or not?|Q|Bed012
me012|for every question?|Q|Bed012
me012|like|D|Bed012
me003|every construction.|S|Bed012
me012|huh|F|Bed012
me012|i don't not necessarily i would think.|S|Bed012
me012|i mean it's not based on constructions.|S|Bed012
me012|it's based on things like uh there's going to be a node for go there or not and there's going to be a node for enter view approach.|S|Bed012
me003|okay.|F|Bed012
me003|so someone asked a question.|S|Bed012
me012|yeah.|B|Bed012
me003|how do we decide how to answer it?|Q|Bed012
mn015|well look at look face yourself with this question.|S|Bed012
mn015|you get this you'll have this is what you get.|S|Bed012
mn015|and now you have to make a decision what do we think.|S|Bed012
mn015|what does this tell us?|Q|Bed012
mn015|and not knowing what was asked and what happened and whether the person was a tourist or a local.|S|Bed012
mn015|because all of these factors have presumably already gone into making these posterior probabilities.|S|Bed012
me003|yeah.|B|Bed012
mn015|what what we need is a just a mechanism that says aha there is|S|Bed012
me003|i just don't think a winner take all type of thing is the|D|Bed012
me012|i mean in general like we won't just have those three.|S|Bed012
me012|right?|Q|Bed012
me012|we'll have uh like many many nodes.|S|Bed012
mn015|yep.|S|Bed012
me012|so we have to like so that it's no longer possible to just look at the nodes themselves and figure out what the person is trying to say.|S|Bed012
mn015|because there are interdependencies.|S|Bed012
mn015|right?|Q|Bed012
mn015|the uh|D|Bed012
mn015|uh no so if if for example the go there posterior possibility is so high um|D|Bed012
mn015|uh if it's if it has reached reached a certain height then all of this becomes irrelevant.|S|Bed012
mn015|so if even if if the function or the history or something is scoring pretty good on the true node true value|D|Bed012
me003|i don't know about that.|S|Bed012
me003|because that would suggest that i mean|D|Bed012
mn015|he wants to go there and know something about it?|Q|Bed012
me003|do they have to be|D|Bed012
me003|yeah do they have to be mutually exclusive?|S|Bed012
mn015|i think to some extent they are.|S|Bed012
mn015|or maybe they're not.|S|Bed012
me003|because i uh the way you describe what they meant they weren't uh they didn't seem mutually exclusive to me.|S|Bed012
mn015|well if he doesn't want to go there even if the enter posterior|D|Bed012
mn015|so|F|Bed012
mn015|go there is no.|S|Bed012
mn015|enter is high.|S|Bed012
mn015|and info on is high.|S|Bed012
me003|well yeah just out of the other three though that you had in the|D|Bed012
mn015|huh?|Q|Bed012
me003|those three nodes.|S|Bed012
me003|they didn't seem like they were mutually exclusive.|S|Bed012
mn015|no there's no.|S|Bed012
mn015|but|D|Bed012
mn015|it's through the|D|Bed012
me003|so so yeah but some so some things would drop out and some things would still be important.|S|Bed012
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed012
me003|but i guess what's confusing me is if we have a bayes net to deal another bayes net to deal with this stuff.|S|Bed012
me012|uhhuh.|B|Bed012
me003|you know.|F|Bed012
me003|uh|F|Bed012
me003|is the only reason okay so i guess if we have a another bayes net to deal with this stuff the only reason we can design it is because we know what each question is asking?|Q|Bed012
me012|yeah.|S|Bed012
me012|i think that's true.|S|Bed012
me003|and then so the only reason way we would know what question he's asking is based upon|D|Bed012
me003|oh so if let's say i had a construction parser and i plug this in i would know what each construction the communicative intent of the construction was.|S|Bed012
me012|uhhuh.|B|Bed012
me003|and so then i would know how to weight the nodes appropriately in response.|S|Bed012
me003|so no matter what they said if i could map it onto a where is construction i could say uh.|S|Bed012
me012|uhhuh.|B|Bed012
me003|well the intent here was where is.|S|Bed012
me012|okay right.|S|Bed012
me003|and i could look at those.|S|Bed012
me012|yeah.|S|Bed012
me012|yes i mean|D|Bed012
me012|sure.|S|Bed012
me012|you do need to know i mean to have that kind of information.|S|Bed012
mn015|huh|B|Bed012
mn015|yeah i'm also agreeing that a simple|D|Bed012
mn015|take the ones where we have a clear winner.|S|Bed012
mn015|forget about the ones where it's all sort of middle ground.|S|Bed012
mn015|prune those out.|S|Bed012
mn015|and just hand over the ones where we have a winner.|S|Bed012
mn015|yeah because that would be the easiest way.|S|Bed012
mn015|we just compose as an output an x m l message that says go there now enter historical information.|S|Bed012
mn015|and not care whether that's consistent with anything.|S|Bed012
mn015|right?|Q|Bed012
mn015|but in this case if we say definitely he doesn't want to go there he just wants to know where it is.|S|Bed012
mn015|or let's call this this look at|D|Bed012
mn015|he wants to know something about the history of.|S|Bed012
mn015|so he said tell me something about the history of that.|S|Bed012
mn015|now the but for some reason the endpoint approach gets a really high score too.|S|Bed012
mn015|we can't expect this to be sort of at o point three three three o point three three three o point three three three.|S|Bed012
mn015|right?|Q|Bed012
mn015|somebody needs to zap that.|S|Bed012
mn015|you know?|Q|Bed012
mn015|or know there needs to be some knowledge that|D|Bed012
me003|we yeah but the bayes net that would merge|D|Bed012
me003|i just realized that i had my hand in between my mouth and my uh my and my microphone.|S|Bed012
me003|so then the bayes net that would merge there that would make the decision between go there info on and location would have a node to tell you which one of those three you wanted.|S|Bed012
me003|and based upon that node then you would look at the other stuff.|S|Bed012
mn015|yep.|S|Bed012
me003|i mean|D|Bed012
mn015|yep.|S|Bed012
me003|does that make sense?|Q|Bed012
mn015|yep it's sort of one of those that's it's more like a decision tree if if you want.|S|Bed012
mn015|you first look at the lowball ones.|S|Bed012
me003|yeah|D|Bed012
mn015|and then|D|Bed012
me003|yeah i didn't intend to say that every possible|D|Bed012
me003|okay.|F|Bed012
me003|there was a confusion there.|S|Bed012
me003|i didn't intend to say every possible thing should go into the bayes net.|S|Bed012
me003|because some of the things aren't relevant in the bayes net for a specific question.|S|Bed012
me003|like the endpoint is not necessarily relevant in the bayes net for where is until after you've decided whether you want to go there or not.|S|Bed012
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed012
me012|right.|S|Bed012
me003|show us the way bhaskara.|S|Bed012
me012|i guess the other thing is that um yeah|D|Bed012
me012|i mean when you're asked a specific question and you don't even|D|Bed012
me012|like if you're asked a where is question you may not even look like ask for the posterior probability of the uh e v a node.|S|Bed012
me012|right?|Q|Bed012
me012|because that's what i mean in the bayes net you always ask for the posterior probability of a specific node.|S|Bed012
me012|so i mean|F|Bed012
me012|you may not even bother to compute things you don't need.|S|Bed012
mn015|um|F|Bed012
mn015|aren't we always computing all?|Q|Bed012
me012|no.|S|Bed012
me012|you can compute uh the posterior probability of one subset of the nodes given some other nodes.|S|Bed012
me012|but totally ignore some other nodes also.|S|Bed012
me012|basically things you ignore get marginalized over.|S|Bed012
mn015|yeah but that's that's just shifting the problem.|S|Bed012
mn015|then you would have to make a decision.|S|Bed012
mn015|okay if it's a where is question which decision nodes do i query.|S|Bed012
me012|yeah so you have to make|D|Bed012
me012|yeah.|S|Bed012
me012|yes.|S|Bed012
mn015|that's|D|Bed012
me012|but i would think that's what you want to do.|S|Bed012
me012|right?|Q|Bed012
mn015|huh.|S|Bed012
fn050|well eventually you still have to pick out which ones you look at.|S|Bed012
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed012
fn050|so it's pretty much the same problem.|S|Bed012
mn015|yeah it's it's it's apples and oranges.|S|Bed012
fn050|isn't it?|Q|Bed012
mn015|nuh?|Q|Bed012
mn015|i mean maybe it does make a difference in terms of performance computational time.|S|Bed012
mn015|so either you always have it compute all the posterior possibilities for all the values for all nodes and then prune the ones you think that are irrelevant|D|Bed012
me012|uhhuh.|B|Bed012
me012|huh|B|Bed012
mn015|or you just make a a priori estimate of what you think might be relevant and query those.|S|Bed012
me012|yeah.|S|Bed012
me003|so basically you'd have a decision tree query go there?|Q|Bed012
me003|if if that's false query this one if that's true query that one.|S|Bed012
me003|and just basically do a binary search through the|D|Bed012
me012|i don't know if it would necessarily be that uh complicated.|S|Bed012
me012|but uh|F|Bed012
me003|well in the case of go there it would be.|S|Bed012
me012|i mean it|D|Bed012
me003|in the case|D|Bed012
me003|because if you needed if if go there was true you'd want to know what endpoint was.|S|Bed012
me003|and if it was false you'd want to look at either income info on or history.|S|Bed012
me012|yeah.|S|Bed012
me012|that's true i guess.|S|Bed012
me012|yeah so in a way you would have that.|S|Bed012
me003|also i'm somewhat boggled by that hugin software.|S|Bed012
me012|okay why's that?|S|Bed012
me003|i can't figure out how to get the probabilities into it.|S|Bed012
me003|like i'd look at|D|Bed012
me012|uhhuh.|B|Bed012
me003|it's it's boggling me.|S|Bed012
me012|okay.|S|Bed012
me012|all right.|S|Bed012
me012|well hopefully it's fixable.|S|Bed012
me003|oh yeah yeah i i just think i haven't figured out what the terms in hugin mean versus what java bayes terms are.|S|Bed012
me012|it's there's a|D|Bed012
me012|okay.|S|Bed012
mn015|um by the way are do we know whether jerry and nancy are coming?|Q|Bed012
me012|so we can figure this out.|S|Bed012
mn015|or|D|Bed012
me012|they should come when they're done their stuff basically whenever that is.|S|Bed012
me012|so|F|Bed012
me003|what what do they need to do left?|Q|Bed012
me012|um|F|Bed012
me012|i guess jerry needs to enter marks.|S|Bed012
me012|but i don't know if he's going to do that now or later.|S|Bed012
me012|but uh if he's going to enter marks it's going to take him awhile i guess.|S|Bed012
me012|and he won't be here.|S|Bed012
me003|and what's nancy doing?|Q|Bed012
me012|nancy?|Q|Bed012
me012|um she was sort of finishing up the uh calculation of marks and assigning of grades.|S|Bed012
me012|but i don't know if she should be here.|S|Bed012
me012|well or she should be free after that.|S|Bed012
me012|so|F|Bed012
me012|assuming she's coming to this meeting.|S|Bed012
me012|i don't know if she knows about it.|S|Bed012
me003|she's on the email list.|S|Bed012
me003|right?|Q|Bed012
me012|is she?|Q|Bed012
me012|okay.|S|Bed012
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed012
mn015|okay.|F|Bed012
mn015|because|D|Bed012
mn015|basically what where we also have decided prior to this meeting is that we would have a rerun of the three of us sitting together.|S|Bed012
fn050|okay.|B|Bed012
mn015|sometime this week again.|S|Bed012
me012|okay.|B|Bed012
mn015|and finish up the uh values of this.|S|Bed012
mn015|so we have uh believe it or not we have all the bottom ones here.|S|Bed012
me003|well i|D|Bed012
fn050|you added a bunch of nodes for|D|Bed012
mn015|yep.|S|Bed012
fn050|okay.|S|Bed012
mn015|we we we have actually what we have is this line.|S|Bed012
mn015|right?|Q|Bed012
me003|uh what do the uh structures do?|Q|Bed012
mn015|huh|B|Bed012
me003|so the the the for instance this location node's got two inputs.|S|Bed012
me003|that one you|D|Bed012
me012|four inputs.|S|Bed012
mn015|huh|B|Bed012
mn015|four.|S|Bed012
me012|those are the bottom things are inputs also.|S|Bed012
me003|oh i see.|S|Bed012
me012|yeah.|S|Bed012
me003|okay that was|D|Bed012
me003|okay that makes a lot more sense to me now.|S|Bed012
mn015|yep.|B|Bed012
me003|because i thought it was like that one in stuart's book about you know the|D|Bed012
me012|alarm in the dog?|Q|Bed012
me003|yeah.|S|Bed012
me012|yeah.|B|Bed012
me003|or the earthquake and the alarm.|S|Bed012
me012|sorry yeah i'm confusing two.|S|Bed012
me003|yeah there's a dog one too.|S|Bed012
me003|but that's in java bayes.|S|Bed012
me003|isn't it?|Q|Bed012
me012|right.|S|Bed012
me012|maybe.|S|Bed012
me003|but there's something about bowel problems or something with the dog.|S|Bed012
me012|yeah.|B|Bed012
mn015|and we have all the top ones.|S|Bed012
mn015|all the ones to which no arrows are pointing.|S|Bed012
mn015|what we're missing are the these.|S|Bed012
mn015|where arrows are pointing.|S|Bed012
mn015|where we're combining top ones.|S|Bed012
mn015|so we have to come up with values for this and this this this and so forth.|S|Bed012
mn015|and maybe just fiddle around with it a little bit more.|S|Bed012
mn015|and um|F|Bed012
mn015|and then it's just uh edges.|S|Bed012
mn015|many of|D|Bed012
mn015|edges.|S|Bed012
mn015|and um we won't meet next monday.|S|Bed012
mn015|so|F|Bed012
me003|because of memorial day?|Q|Bed012
mn015|yep.|S|Bed012
me012|we'll meet next tuesday i guess.|S|Bed012
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed012
me003|when's jerry leaving for italia?|Q|Bed012
mn015|on on friday.|S|Bed012
me012|which friday?|Q|Bed012
mn015|this this friday.|S|Bed012
me012|okay.|S|Bed012
fn050|oh this friday?|S|Bed012
me003|ugh.|B|Bed012
mn015|this friday.|S|Bed012
me003|as in four days?|Q|Bed012
mn015|yep.|S|Bed012
me003|or three days.|S|Bed012
me012|is he how long is he gone for?|Q|Bed012
mn015|two weeks.|S|Bed012
me012|italy huh?|Q|Bed012
me012|what's uh what's there?|Q|Bed012
mn015|well it's a country.|S|Bed012
mn015|buildings.|S|Bed012
mn015|people.|S|Bed012
me003|but it's not a conference or anything.|S|Bed012
me012|pasta.|S|Bed012
me003|he's just visiting.|S|Bed012
mn015|huh|B|Bed012
me012|right.|S|Bed012
me012|just visiting.|S|Bed012
mn015|vacation.|S|Bed012
me012|it's a pretty nice place.|S|Bed012
me012|in my brief uh encounter with it.|S|Bed012
mn015|do you guys|D|Bed012
mn015|oh yeah so part of what we actually want to do is sort of schedule out what we want to surprise him with when when he comes back.|S|Bed012
mn015|um so|F|Bed012
me003|oh i think we should disappoint him.|S|Bed012
mn015|yeah?|Q|Bed012
mn015|you or have a finished construction parser and a working belief net.|S|Bed012
mn015|and uh|F|Bed012
me003|that wouldn't be disappointing.|S|Bed012
me003|i think we should do absolutely no work for the two weeks that he's gone.|S|Bed012
mn015|well that's actually what i had planned personally.|S|Bed012
mn015|i had i i had sort of scheduled out in my mind that you guys do a lot of work and i do nothing.|S|Bed012
mn015|and then i sort of|D|Bed012
me003|oh yeah that sounds good too.|S|Bed012
mn015|sort of bask in in your glory.|S|Bed012
mn015|but uh do you guys have any vacation plans?|Q|Bed012
mn015|because i myself am going to be um gone.|S|Bed012
mn015|but this is actually not really important.|S|Bed012
mn015|just this weekend we're going camping.|S|Bed012
me003|yeah i'm want to be this gone this weekend too.|S|Bed012
mn015|uh|B|Bed012
mn015|but we're all going to be here on tuesday again?|Q|Bed012
mn015|looks like it.|S|Bed012
fn050|yeah.|S|Bed012
mn015|okay then let's meet meet again next tuesday.|S|Bed012
mn015|and um finish up this bayes net.|S|Bed012
mn015|and once we have finished it i guess we can um|D|Bed012
mn015|and that's going to be more just you and me.|S|Bed012
mn015|because bhaskara is doing probabilistic recursive structured object oriented uh|D|Bed012
me003|killing machines.|S|Bed012
mn015|reasoning machines.|S|Bed012
me012|yes.|B|Bed012
mn015|and um|F|Bed012
me003|killing reasoning what's the difference?|Q|Bed012
fn050|wait so you're saying next tuesday is it the whole group meeting?|Q|Bed012
fn050|or just us three working on it or or|D|Bed012
mn015|uh|F|Bed012
mn015|the whole group.|S|Bed012
mn015|and we present our results.|S|Bed012
mn015|our final.|S|Bed012
fn050|okay.|S|Bed012
mn015|definite.|S|Bed012
fn050|so when you were saying we need to do a re run of like|D|Bed012
me012|what?|Q|Bed012
fn050|what like just working out the rest of the|D|Bed012
mn015|yeah we should do this the upcoming days.|S|Bed012
fn050|this week?|Q|Bed012
mn015|so this week yeah.|S|Bed012
fn050|okay.|S|Bed012
me003|when you say the whole group you mean the four of us and keith?|Q|Bed012
mn015|and ami might|D|Bed012
me003|ami might be here.|S|Bed012
me003|and it's possible that nancy will be here.|S|Bed012
mn015|yep.|S|Bed012
me003|so|F|Bed012
me003|yeah.|F|Bed012
mn015|because you know|D|Bed012
mn015|once we have the belief net done|D|Bed012
me003|you're just going to have to explain it to me then on tuesday.|S|Bed012
me003|how it's all going to work out.|S|Bed012
me003|you know.|B|Bed012
mn015|we will.|S|Bed012
mn015|okay because then once we have it sort of up and running then we can start you know defining the interfaces.|S|Bed012
mn015|and then feed stuff into it.|S|Bed012
mn015|and get stuff out of it.|S|Bed012
mn015|and then hook it up to some fake construction parser.|S|Bed012
mn015|and|F|Bed012
me003|that you will have in about nine months or so.|S|Bed012
me003|yeah.|B|Bed012
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed012
mn015|and um|F|Bed012
me003|the first bad version will be done in nine months.|S|Bed012
mn015|yeah i can worry about the ontology interface.|S|Bed012
mn015|and you can keith can worry about the discourse.|S|Bed012
mn015|i mean this is pretty um i mean i i i hope everybody uh knows that these are just going to be uh dummy values.|S|Bed012
mn015|right?|Q|Bed012
me012|which|D|Bed012
mn015|where the|D|Bed012
me012|which ones?|Q|Bed012
mn015|so so if the endpoint if the go there is yes and no then go there discourse will just be fifty fifty.|S|Bed012
mn015|right?|Q|Bed012
me012|um what do you mean if the go there says no then the go there is|D|Bed012
fn050|i don't get it.|S|Bed012
me012|i don't understand.|S|Bed012
mn015|um|F|Bed012
me012|like the go there depends on all those four things.|S|Bed012
mn015|yep.|S|Bed012
me012|yeah.|B|Bed012
mn015|but what are the values of the go there discourse?|Q|Bed012
me012|well it depends on the situation.|S|Bed012
me012|if the discourse is strongly indicating that|D|Bed012
mn015|yeah but uh we have no discourse input.|S|Bed012
me012|oh i see the see uh specifically in our situation d and o are going to be uh|D|Bed012
me012|yeah.|S|Bed012
me012|sure.|S|Bed012
me012|so whatever.|S|Bed012
fn050|so so far we have|D|Bed012
fn050|is that what the keith node is?|Q|Bed012
mn015|yep.|S|Bed012
fn050|okay and you're taking it out for now?|S|Bed012
fn050|or|D|Bed012
mn015|well this is d|D|Bed012
mn015|okay this i can i can get it in here.|S|Bed012
fn050|all the d s are|D|Bed012
mn015|i can get it in here.|S|Bed012
mn015|so we have the uh um|D|Bed012
mn015|let's let's call it keith johno.|S|Bed012
mn015|node.|S|Bed012
me012|johno.|S|Bed012
mn015|there is an h somewhere printed.|S|Bed012
me003|there you go.|S|Bed012
me012|yeah people have the same problem with my name.|S|Bed012
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed012
me012|oops!|S|Bed012
mn015|and um|F|Bed012
me003|does does the h go before the a or after the a?|Q|Bed012
me012|oh in my name?|Q|Bed012
me003|yeah.|S|Bed012
me012|before the a.|S|Bed012
me003|okay good.|S|Bed012
me003|because you when you said people have the same problem i thought|D|Bed012
me003|because my h goes after the uh the|D|Bed012
me012|people have the inverse problem with my name.|S|Bed012
me003|okay.|S|Bed012
me003|i always have to check every time i send you an email a past email of yours to make sure i'm spelling your name correctly.|S|Bed012
me012|yeah.|B|Bed012
me012|that's good.|S|Bed012
me003|i worry about you.|S|Bed012
me012|i appreciate that.|S|Bed012
mn015|but when you abbreviate yourself as the basman you don't use any h s.|S|Bed012
me012|basman?|Q|Bed012
me012|yeah it's because of the chessplayer named michael basman.|S|Bed012
me012|who is my hero.|S|Bed012
mn015|okay.|S|Bed012
me003|you're a geek!|S|Bed012
me003|it's okay.|S|Bed012
me003|how do you|D|Bed012
mn015|okay.|F|Bed012
me003|how do you pronounce your name?|Q|Bed012
fn050|eva.|S|Bed012
me003|eva?|Q|Bed012
fn050|yeah.|S|Bed012
me012|not eva?|Q|Bed012
me003|what if i were what if i were to call you eva?|Q|Bed012
fn050|i'd probably still respond to it.|S|Bed012
fn050|i've had people call me eva.|S|Bed012
fn050|but i don't know.|S|Bed012
me003|no not just eva eva.|S|Bed012
me003|like if i take the v and pronounce it like it was a german v.|S|Bed012
mn015|which is f.|S|Bed012
me003|yeah.|S|Bed012
fn050|um no idea then.|S|Bed012
mn015|voiced.|S|Bed012
fn050|what?|Q|Bed012
me003|it sounds like an f.|S|Bed012
fn050|i|D|Bed012
me003|there's also an f in german.|S|Bed012
fn050|okay.|S|Bed012
me003|which is why i|D|Bed012
mn015|well it's just the difference between voiced and unvoiced.|S|Bed012
me003|yeah.|B|Bed012
fn050|okay.|S|Bed012
me003|as long as that's okay.|S|Bed012
fn050|um|F|Bed012
me003|i mean i might slip out and say it accidentally.|S|Bed012
me003|that's all i'm saying.|S|Bed012
fn050|that's fine.|S|Bed012
me012|yeah it doesn't matter what those nodes are anyway.|S|Bed012
me012|because we'll just make the weights zero for now.|S|Bed012
mn015|yep.|S|Bed012
mn015|we'll make them zero for now.|S|Bed012
mn015|because it who who knows what they come up with.|S|Bed012
mn015|what's going to come in there.|S|Bed012
mn015|okay.|F|Bed012
mn015|and um|F|Bed012
mn015|then|D|Bed012
mn015|should we start on thursday?|Q|Bed012
me012|okay.|S|Bed012
mn015|and not meet tomorrow?|Q|Bed012
me012|sure.|S|Bed012
mn015|okay.|S|Bed012
mn015|i'll send an email.|S|Bed012
mn015|make a time suggestion.|S|Bed012
me003|wait.|S|Bed012
me003|maybe it's okay so that that that we can that we have one node per construction.|S|Bed012
me003|because even in people like they don't know what you're talking about if you're using some sort of strange construction.|S|Bed012
mn015|yeah they would still sort of get the closest best fit.|S|Bed012
me003|well yeah but i mean the uh i mean that's what the construction parser would do.|S|Bed012
me003|uh i mean if you said something completely arbitrary it would find the closest construction.|S|Bed012
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed012
mn015|okay.|B|Bed012
me003|right?|Q|Bed012
me003|but if you said something that was uh|D|Bed012
me003|theoretically the construction parser would do that.|S|Bed012
me003|but if you said something for which there was no construction whatsoever people wouldn't have any idea what you were talking about.|S|Bed012
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed012
me003|like bus dog fried egg i mean.|S|Bed012
me003|you know.|B|Bed012
mn015|or if even something chinese for example.|S|Bed012
me003|or something in mandarin yeah.|S|Bed012
me003|or cantonese as the case may be.|S|Bed012
me003|what do you think about that bhaskara?|Q|Bed012
me012|i mean|F|Bed012
me012|well|F|Bed012
me012|but how many constructions do could we possibly have nodes for?|Q|Bed012
me003|in this system or in|D|Bed012
me012|no we.|S|Bed012
me012|like when people do this kind of thing.|S|Bed012
me003|oh when how many constructions do people have?|Q|Bed012
me012|yeah.|S|Bed012
me003|i have not the slightest idea.|S|Bed012
me012|is it considered to be like in are they considered to be like very uh sort of abstract things?|Q|Bed012
me003|every noun is a construction.|S|Bed012
me012|okay so it's like in the thousands.|S|Bed012
me003|the|D|Bed012
me003|yeah.|B|Bed012
me003|any any form meaning pair to my understanding is a construction.|S|Bed012
me012|okay.|S|Bed012
mn015|so|F|Bed012
me003|and form starts at the level of noun or actually maybe even sounds.|S|Bed012
mn015|phoneme.|S|Bed012
mn015|yep.|B|Bed012
me003|yeah.|B|Bed012
me003|and goes upwards.|S|Bed012
me003|until you get the ditransitive construction.|S|Bed012
me003|and then of course the i guess maybe there can be the|D|Bed012
me003|can there be combinations of the|D|Bed012
me012|discourse level constructions.|S|Bed012
me003|yeah.|S|Bed012
me003|the giving a speech construction.|S|Bed012
mn015|rhetorical constructions.|S|Bed012
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed012
me012|yes.|B|Bed012
mn015|but i mean you know you can probably count count the ways.|S|Bed012
mn015|i mean|F|Bed012
me003|it's yeah i would definitely say it's finite.|S|Bed012
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed012
me003|and at least in compilers that's all that really matters.|S|Bed012
me003|as long as your analysis is finite.|S|Bed012
me012|how's that how it can be finite again?|Q|Bed012
me003|nah i can't think of a way it would be infinite.|S|Bed012
mn015|well you can come up with new constructions.|S|Bed012
me003|yeah if the if your if your brain was totally non deterministic then perhaps there's a way to get uh an infinite number of constructions that you'd have to worry about.|S|Bed012
me012|but i mean in the practical sense it's impossible.|S|Bed012
me003|right because if we have a fixed number of neurons.|S|Bed012
me012|yeah.|S|Bed012
me003|so the best case scenario would be the number of constructions|D|Bed012
me003|or the worst case scenario is the number of constructions equals the number of neurons.|S|Bed012
me012|well two to the power of the number of neurons.|S|Bed012
me003|right.|S|Bed012
me003|but still finite.|S|Bed012
mn015|okay.|B|Bed012
me003|no wait.|S|Bed012
me003|not necessarily is it?|Q|Bed012
me003|we can end the meeting.|S|Bed012
me003|i just|D|Bed012
me003|can't you use different different levels of activation?|Q|Bed012
me003|across uh lots of different neurons to specify different values.|S|Bed012
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed012
me012|um yeah but there's like a certain level of|D|Bed012
me003|there's a bandwidth issue.|S|Bed012
me003|right?|Q|Bed012
me012|yeah so you can't do better than something.|S|Bed012
me003|yeah.|B|Bed012
