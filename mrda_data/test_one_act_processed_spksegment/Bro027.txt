me013|so|F|Bro027|0
me013|let's see.|F|Bro027|0
me013|yeah barry's not here and dave's not here.|S|Bro027|0
me013|um i can say about just just quickly to get through it that dave and i submitted this a.s.r.u.|D|Bro027|0
me018|this is for|D|Bro027|1
me018|a.s.r.u.|S|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so|F|Bro027|0
me013|um|F|Bro027|0
me013|yeah it's it's interesting.|S|Bro027|0
me013|i mean basically we're dealing with reverberation.|S|Bro027|0
me013|and um when we deal with pure reverberation the technique he's using works really really well.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uh and when they had the reverberation here uh we'll measure the signal to noise ratio.|S|Bro027|0
me013|and it's uh about nine d.b.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|huh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|so|F|Bro027|0
me013|um|F|Bro027|0
me013|a fair amount of|D|Bro027|0
me018|you mean from the actual uh recordings?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me018|it's nine d. b?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|um|F|Bro027|0
me013|and actually it brought up a question which may be relevant to the aurora stuff too.|S|Bro027|0
me013|um i know that when you figured out the filters that we're using for the mel scale there was some experimentation that went on at at uh at o.g.i.|S|Bro027|0
me013|um|F|Bro027|0
me013|but one of the differences that we found between the two systems that we were using the the aurora h.t.k. system baseline system and the system that we were the the uh other system we were using the uh the s.r.i. system was that the s.r.i. system had maybe a um hundred hertz high pass.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|yep.|B|Bro027|1
me013|and the uh aurora h.t.k. it was like twenty.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|sixty four.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|sixty four.|S|Bro027|1
me013|uh|F|Bro027|0
me013|sixty four?|Q|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|uh|F|Bro027|0
mn052|if you're using the baseline.|S|Bro027|1
me013|is that the band center?|Q|Bro027|0
mn052|no.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|the edge.|S|Bro027|1
me013|the edge is really uh sixty four?|Q|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|for some reason uh dave thought it was twenty.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|so the uh center would be somewhere around like hundred.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but|D|Bro027|0
mn052|and hundred and hundred hundred and maybe it's like hundred hertz.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but do you know for instance how far down it would be at twenty hertz?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|what the how much rejection would there be at twenty hertz let's say?|Q|Bro027|0
mn052|at twenty hertz?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|any idea what the curve looks like?|Q|Bro027|0
mn052|twenty hertz frequency.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|oh it's it's zero at twenty hertz right?|S|Bro027|1
mn052|the filter.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|actually the left edge of the first filter is at sixty four.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|sixty four.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|so|F|Bro027|0
mn052|so anything less than sixty four is zero.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|huh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|it's actually set to zero?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|what kind of filter is that?|Q|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|is this oh from the from|D|Bro027|0
mn007|it|D|Bro027|1
mn007|this is the filter bank in the frequency domain that starts at sixty four.|S|Bro027|1
me013|oh so you uh so you really set it to zero the f.f.t.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro027|0
mn052|so it's it's a weight on the ball spectrum.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|triangular weighting.|S|Bro027|1
me013|right.|S|Bro027|0
me013|okay.|S|Bro027|0
me013|um|F|Bro027|0
me013|okay.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so that's that's a little different than dave thought i think.|S|Bro027|0
me013|but but|F|Bro027|0
me013|um|F|Bro027|0
me013|still it's possible that we're getting in some more noise.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so i wonder is it was there their experimentation with uh say throwing away that filter or something?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|and uh|F|Bro027|0
mn052|uh throwing away the first?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|um|F|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah we we've tried including the full full bank.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|right?|Q|Bro027|1
mn052|from zero to four k. .|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|and that's always worse than using sixty four hertz.|S|Bro027|1
me013|right.|S|Bro027|0
me013|but the question is whether sixty four hertz is is uh too uh low.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|i mean make it a hundred or so?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|i i think i've tried a hundred and it was more or less the same or slightly worse.|S|Bro027|1
me013|on what test set?|Q|Bro027|0
mn052|on the same uh speechdat-car.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|aurora.|S|Bro027|1
me013|um it was on the speechdat-car.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|so i tried a hundred to four k. .|S|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah.|F|Bro027|1
me013|um|F|Bro027|0
mn052|so it was|D|Bro027|1
me013|and on and on the um um t.i. digits also?|Q|Bro027|0
mn052|no no no.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|i think i just tried it on speechdat-car.|S|Bro027|1
me013|huh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|that'd be something to look at sometime.|S|Bro027|0
me013|because what um uh he was looking at was performance in this room.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|would that be more like|D|Bro027|0
me013|well you'd think that'd be more like speechdat-car.|S|Bro027|0
me013|i guess.|S|Bro027|0
me013|in terms of the noise.|S|Bro027|0
me013|the speechdat-car is more uh sort of roughly stationary a lot of it.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me013|and and t.i. digits maybe is not so much as|D|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|F|Bro027|1
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|okay.|S|Bro027|1
me013|well maybe it's not a big deal.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but um|F|Bro027|1
me013|anyway that was just something we wondered about.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but um|F|Bro027|1
me013|uh certainly a lot of the noise uh is uh below a hundred hertz.|S|Bro027|1
me013|uh the signal to noise ratio you know looks a fair amount better if you if you high pass filter it from this room.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|but um|F|Bro027|1
me013|but it's still pretty noisy.|S|Bro027|1
me013|even even for a hundred hertz up it's it's still fairly noisy.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|the signal to noise ratio is is is actually still pretty bad.|S|Bro027|1
me018|huh?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|so um|F|Bro027|1
me013|i mean the main the the|D|Bro027|1
me018|so that's on that's on the the far field ones though right?|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|that's on the far field.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah the near field's pretty good.|S|Bro027|1
me018|so what is uh what's causing that?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|well we got a a video projector in here.|S|Bro027|1
me013|uh|F|Bro027|1
me013|and uh which we keep on during every every session we record.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|which you know i i we were aware of.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but but we thought it wasn't a bad thing.|S|Bro027|1
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|i mean that's a nice noise source.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|uh and there's also the uh uh air conditioning.|S|Bro027|1
me018|huh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|which uh you know is a pretty low frequency kind of thing.|S|Bro027|1
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|but but uh|F|Bro027|1
me013|so those are those are major components i think.|S|Bro027|1
me018|i see.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uh for the stationary kind of stuff.|S|Bro027|1
me018|huh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|um|F|Bro027|1
me013|but um|F|Bro027|1
me013|it uh|D|Bro027|1
me013|i guess i maybe i said this last week too.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but it it it really became apparent to us that we need to to take account of noise.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and uh|F|Bro027|1
me013|so i think when when he gets done with his prelim study i think one of the next things we'd want to do is to take this uh uh noise uh processing stuff and and uh uh synthesize some speech from it.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and then|D|Bro027|1
me018|when are his prelims?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|um i think in about um a little less than two weeks.|S|Bro027|1
me018|oh.|S|Bro027|0
me018|wow.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|F|Bro027|1
me013|so|F|Bro027|1
me013|uh it might even be sooner.|S|Bro027|1
me013|uh let's see this is the sixteenth?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|seventeenth?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|yeah i don't know if he's before|D|Bro027|1
me013|it might even be in a week.|S|Bro027|1
me018|so|F|Bro027|0
me013|a week.|S|Bro027|1
me018|huh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|week and a half.|S|Bro027|1
me018|i i guessed that they were going to do it some time during the semester.|S|Bro027|0
me018|but they'll do it any time huh?|S|Bro027|0
me013|they seem to be|D|Bro027|1
me013|well the semester actually is starting up.|S|Bro027|1
me018|is it already?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|the semester's late late august they start here.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yikes.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so they do it right at the beginning of the semester.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me013|so uh|F|Bro027|1
me013|yep.|S|Bro027|1
me013|i mean that that was sort of one|D|Bro027|1
me013|i mean|D|Bro027|1
me013|the overall results seemed to be first place in in in the case of either um artificial reverberation or a modest sized training set.|S|Bro027|1
me013|uh either way uh uh it helped a lot.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and but if you had a a really big training set a recognizer uh system that was capable of taking advantage of a really large training set|D|Bro027|1
me013|i thought that one thing with the h.t.k. is that is has the as we're using the configuration we're using is is being bound by the terms of aurora.|S|Bro027|1
me013|we have all those parameters just set as they are.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so even if we had a hundred times as much data we wouldn't go out to you know ten or or a hundred times as many gaussians or anything.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so|F|Bro027|1
me013|um it's kind of hard to take advantage of of of big chunks of data.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
mn052|huh yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me013|uh whereas the other one does sort of expand as you have more training data.|S|Bro027|0
me013|it does it automatically actually.|S|Bro027|0
me013|and so|F|Bro027|0
me013|um|F|Bro027|0
me013|uh|F|Bro027|0
me013|that one really benefited from the larger set.|S|Bro027|0
me013|and it was also a diverse set with different noises and so forth.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uh so um|F|Bro027|0
me013|that uh that seemed to be|D|Bro027|0
me013|so if you have that that better recognizer that can that can build up more parameters and if you um have the natural room which in this case has a a pretty bad signal to noise ratio then in that case um the right thing to do is just do use speaker adaptation and and not bother with with this acoustic uh processing.|S|Bro027|0
me013|but i think that that would not be true if we did some explicit noise processing as well as uh the convolutional kind of things we were doing.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|so|F|Bro027|0
me013|that's sort of what we found.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|huh.|B|Bro027|1
me018|i um uh started working on the uh mississippi state recognizer.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|oh.|S|Bro027|1
me018|so i got in touch with joe and and uh from your email and things like that.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|okay.|S|Bro027|1
me018|and uh they added me to the list.|S|Bro027|0
me018|uh the mailing list.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|okay.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|great.|S|Bro027|1
me018|and he gave me all of the pointers and everything that i needed.|S|Bro027|0
me018|and so i downloaded the um|D|Bro027|0
me018|there were two things uh that they had to download.|S|Bro027|0
me018|one was the uh i guess the software.|S|Bro027|0
me018|and another wad was a um sort of like a sample a sample run.|S|Bro027|0
me018|so i downloaded the software and compiled all of that.|S|Bro027|0
me018|and it compiled fine.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|eight.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|oh uh great.|S|Bro027|1
me018|no problems.|S|Bro027|0
me018|and um i grabbed the sample stuff.|S|Bro027|0
me018|but i haven't uh compiled it.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|that sample was released only yesterday or the day before right?|S|Bro027|1
me018|no.|S|Bro027|0
me018|well i haven't grabbed that one yet.|S|Bro027|0
me018|so there's two.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|oh there is another short sample set.|S|Bro027|1
me018|there was another short one.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|sample.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|okay.|S|Bro027|1
me018|and so i haven't grabbed the latest one that he just uh put out yet.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|oh okay.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah okay.|S|Bro027|1
me018|so|F|Bro027|0
me018|um but the software seemed to compile fine and everything.|S|Bro027|0
me018|so|F|Bro027|0
me018|and um|F|Bro027|0
me018|so|F|Bro027|0
me013|is there any word yet about the issues about um adjustments for different feature sets or anything?|Q|Bro027|1
me018|no.|S|Bro027|0
me018|i i|D|Bro027|0
me018|you asked me to write to him.|S|Bro027|0
me018|and i think i forgot to ask him about that.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me018|or if i did ask him he didn't reply.|S|Bro027|0
me018|i i don't remember yet.|S|Bro027|0
me018|uh i'll i'll i'll double check that and ask him again.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|huh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me013|it's like that that could turn out to be an important issue for us.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|huh.|B|Bro027|0
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|F|Bro027|0
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|because they have it.|S|Bro027|0
me018|maybe i'll send it to the list.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|because they have uh already frozen those in insertion penalties and all those stuff is what i feel.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|because they have this document explaining the recognizer.|S|Bro027|0
me018|uhhuh.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|and they have these tables with uh various language model weights insertion penalties.|S|Bro027|0
me018|okay i haven't seen that one yet.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|uh it's it's there on that web.|S|Bro027|0
me018|so|F|Bro027|1
me018|okay.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|and uh on that i mean they have run some experiments using various insertion penalties and all those|D|Bro027|0
me018|and so they've picked the values.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah i think they|D|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah they picked the values from|D|Bro027|0
me018|oh okay.|S|Bro027|1
me018|okay.|S|Bro027|1
me013|for what test set?|Q|Bro027|0
mn052|uh the one that they have reported is a nist evaluation wall street journal.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but that has nothing to do with what we're testing on right?|S|Bro027|0
mn052|you know.|F|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
mn052|no.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|so they're like|D|Bro027|1
mn052|um|F|Bro027|1
mn052|so they are actually trying to uh fix that those values using the clean uh training part of the wall street journal.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|which is|D|Bro027|1
mn052|i mean the aurora.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|aurora has a clean subset.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|i mean they want to train it.|S|Bro027|1
me013|right.|B|Bro027|0
mn052|and then this they're going to run some evaluations.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so they're they're setting it based on that?|Q|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|okay.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so now we may come back to the situation where we may be looking for a modification of the features to account for the fact that we can't modify these parameters.|S|Bro027|0
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me013|but um|F|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me013|uh|F|Bro027|0
me013|but it's still worth i think just since you know just chatting with joe about the issue.|S|Bro027|0
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me018|okay.|S|Bro027|1
me018|do you think that's something i should just send to him?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|um|F|Bro027|0
me018|or do you think i should send it to this there's an a a mailing list?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|well it's not a secret.|S|Bro027|0
me013|i mean we're you know certainly willing to talk about it with everybody.|S|Bro027|0
me013|but i think i think that um um it's probably best to start talking with him just to|D|Bro027|0
me018|okay.|S|Bro027|1
me013|uh you know it's a dialogue between two of you about what you know what does he think about this and what what you know what could be done about it.|S|Bro027|0
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me013|um|F|Bro027|0
me018|okay.|S|Bro027|1
me013|if you get ten people in involved in it there'll be a lot of perspectives based on you know how|D|Bro027|0
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|you know.|F|Bro027|0
me018|right.|B|Bro027|1
me013|uh|F|Bro027|0
me013|but i mean i think it all should come up eventually.|S|Bro027|0
me013|but if if if there is any uh uh way to move in a way that would that would you know be more open to different kinds of features.|S|Bro027|0
me018|okay.|B|Bro027|1
me013|but if if uh if there isn't and it's just kind of shut down and and then also there's probably not worthwhile bringing it into a larger forum where where political issues will come in.|S|Bro027|0
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me018|okay.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|oh.|B|Bro027|0
mn052|so this is now it's it's compiled under solaris?|Q|Bro027|0
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah okay.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|because he there was some mail saying that it's may not be stable for linux and all those.|S|Bro027|0
me018|yep.|B|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me018|that was a particular version.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|susi.|S|Bro027|0
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah.|F|Bro027|0
me018|susi or whatever it was.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me018|but we don't have that.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah okay.|B|Bro027|0
me018|so|F|Bro027|1
mn052|okay.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|that's fine.|S|Bro027|0
me018|should be okay.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah it compiled fine actually.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me018|no no errors.|S|Bro027|1
me018|nothing.|S|Bro027|1
me018|so|F|Bro027|1
mn052|that's good.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uh this is slightly off topic.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but uh|F|Bro027|1
me013|i noticed just glancing at the uh hopkins workshop uh web site that uh um one of the i don't know well we'll see how much they accomplish but one of the things that they were trying to do in the graphical models thing was to put together a a uh tool kit for doing uh um arbitrary graphical models for uh speech recognition.|S|Bro027|1
me018|huh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|so and jeff uh the two jeffs were|D|Bro027|1
me018|who's the second jeff?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|uh|F|Bro027|1
me013|oh uh do you know geoff zweig?|S|Bro027|1
me018|no.|S|Bro027|0
me013|oh.|S|Bro027|1
me013|uh he he uh he was here for a couple years.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and he uh got his p.h.d.|S|Bro027|1
me018|oh okay.|S|Bro027|0
me013|he|D|Bro027|1
me013|and he's uh been at i.b.m. for the last couple years.|S|Bro027|1
me018|oh okay.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so|F|Bro027|1
me018|wow.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uh so he did he did his p.h.d. on dynamic bayes-nets.|S|Bro027|1
me018|that would be neat.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uh for for speech recognition.|S|Bro027|1
me013|he had some continuity built into the model.|S|Bro027|1
me013|presumably to handle some um inertia in the in the production system.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and|F|Bro027|1
me013|um|F|Bro027|1
me018|huh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|so|F|Bro027|1
mn052|huh.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|um i've been playing with first the um v.a.d.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|um so it's exactly the same approach.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|but the features that the v.a.d. neural network use are uh m.f.c.c. after noise compensation.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|oh i think i have the results.|S|Bro027|1
me013|what was it using before?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|before it was just p.l.p.'s.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|so|F|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah it was actually|D|Bro027|0
mn052|no.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|not|D|Bro027|0
mn052|i mean it was just the noisy features i guess.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah yeah yeah.|F|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|noisy noisy features.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|not compensated.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|um|F|Bro027|1
mn007|this is what we get after this.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|so actually we yeah here the features are noise compensated.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|and there is also the l.d.a. filter.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|um and then it's a pretty small neural network which use um nine frames of of six features from c. zero to c. fives plus the first derivatives.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|and it has one hundred hidden units.|S|Bro027|1
me018|is that nine frames uh centered around the current frame ? or?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|D|Bro027|1
me013|so i'm i'm sorry.|S|Bro027|0
me013|there's there's there's how many how many inputs?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|so it's twelve times nine.|S|Bro027|1
me013|twelve times nine inputs.|S|Bro027|0
me013|and a hundred uh hidden.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|hidden.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|and|D|Bro027|1
mn052|two outputs.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|two outputs.|S|Bro027|1
me013|two outputs.|S|Bro027|0
me013|okay.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so i guess about eleven thousand parameters.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|which actually shouldn't be a problem even in in small phones . yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me018|so i'm i'm|D|Bro027|1
mn007|it should be okay.|S|Bro027|0
me018|so what is different between this and and what you|D|Bro027|1
mn007|so the previous|D|Bro027|0
mn007|it's based on the system that has a fifty three point sixty six percent improvement.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|it's the same system.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|the only thing that changed is the a uh a the estimation of the silence probabilities.|S|Bro027|0
me018|uh.|S|Bro027|1
me018|okay.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|which now is based on uh cleaned features.|S|Bro027|0
me013|and it's a it's a lot better.|S|Bro027|1
me018|wow.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|um|F|Bro027|1
me013|that's great.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|so it's it's not bad.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|but the problem is still that the latency is too large.|S|Bro027|1
me013|what's the latency?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|because|D|Bro027|1
mn007|um|F|Bro027|1
mn007|the the latency of the v.a.d. is two hundred and twenty milliseconds.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|and uh the v.a.d. is used uh for online normalization.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|and it's used before the delta computation.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|so if you add these components it goes to a hundred and seventy.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|right?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|i i'm confused.|S|Bro027|0
me013|you started off with two twenty and you ended up with one seventy?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|with two two hundred and seventy.|S|Bro027|1
me013|two seventy?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|if|D|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|if you add the delta delta computation.|S|Bro027|1
me013|oh.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|which is done afterwards.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|um|F|Bro027|1
me013|so it's two twenty.|S|Bro027|0
me013|is this are these twenty-millisecond frames?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|is that why?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|is it after downsampling?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|the two twenty is one hundred milliseconds for the um|D|Bro027|1
me013|or|D|Bro027|0
mn007|no it's forty milliseconds for for the uh uh cleaning of the speech.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|um|F|Bro027|1
mn007|then there is um the neural network which use nine frames.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|so it adds forty milliseconds.|S|Bro027|1
me013|okay.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|um|F|Bro027|1
mn007|after that um you have the um filtering of the silence probabilities.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|which is a million filter.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|it|D|Bro027|1
mn007|and it creates a one hundred milliseconds delay.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|so um|F|Bro027|1
mn052|plus there is a delta at the input.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|and there is the delta at the input.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|which is|D|Bro027|1
me013|one hundred milliseconds for smoothing.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|um|F|Bro027|1
mn007|so it's|D|Bro027|1
me013|uh|F|Bro027|0
mn052|it's like forty plus forty plus|D|Bro027|1
me013|median.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|huh.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|forty.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and then forty.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|this forty plus twenty plus one hundred.|S|Bro027|1
me013|forty|D|Bro027|0
mn007|uh|F|Bro027|1
mn052|so it's two hundred actually.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah there are twenty that comes from|D|Bro027|1
mn007|there is ten that comes from the l.d.a. filters also.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|oh okay.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|right?|Q|Bro027|1
mn007|uh so it's two hundred and ten.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro027|1
mn052|if you are using|D|Bro027|0
me013|uh|F|Bro027|1
mn007|plus the frame.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|if you are using three frames.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|so it's two twenty.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|if you are phrasing using three frames it is thirty here for delta.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah i think it's it's five frames.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|so five frames that's twenty.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|but|F|Bro027|0
mn052|okay.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|so it's who two hundred and ten.|S|Bro027|1
me013|uh wait a minute.|S|Bro027|0
me013|it's forty forty for the for the cleaning of the speech.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|so|F|Bro027|1
mn007|forty cleaning.|S|Bro027|1
me013|forty for the i.n. a.n.n.|S|Bro027|0
me013|a hundred for the smoothing.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|well but at ten|D|Bro027|0
mn007|twenty for the delta.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|at at the input.|S|Bro027|0
me013|twenty for delta.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|i mean that's at the input to the net.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me013|delta at input to net?|Q|Bro027|0
mn052|and there|D|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|so it's like five six cepstrum plus delta.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|at nine nine frames of|D|Bro027|1
me013|and then ten milliseconds for|D|Bro027|0
mn052|there's an l.d.a. filter.|S|Bro027|1
me013|ten milliseconds for l.d.a. filter.|S|Bro027|0
me013|and and ten another ten milliseconds you said for the frame?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|for the frame i guess.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|i computed two twenty.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah well it's|D|Bro027|1
mn007|i guess it's for the fr the|D|Bro027|1
me013|okay.|S|Bro027|0
me013|and then there's delta besides that?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|so this is the features that are used by our network.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|and then afterwards you have to compute the delta on the uh main feature stream.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|which is um delta and double deltas.|S|Bro027|1
me013|okay.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|which is fifty milliseconds.|S|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|no i mean the|D|Bro027|0
me013|after the noise part the forty the the other hundred and eighty|D|Bro027|0
me013|well i mean|D|Bro027|0
me013|wait a minute.|S|Bro027|0
me013|some of this is uh is uh is in parallel isn't it?|S|Bro027|0
me013|i mean the l.d.a.|D|Bro027|0
me013|oh you have the l.d.a. as part of the v.d. uh v.a. d?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|or|D|Bro027|0
mn007|the v.a.d. use uh l.d.a. filtered features also.|S|Bro027|1
me013|oh it does?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro027|1
me013|uh.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so in that case there isn't too much in parallel.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uh|F|Bro027|0
mn007|no.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|there is um just downsampling upsampling and the l.d.a.|S|Bro027|1
me013|um so the delta at the end is how much?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|it's fifty.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|it's|D|Bro027|0
me013|fifty.|S|Bro027|1
me013|all right.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so|F|Bro027|1
mn007|but well we could probably put the delta um before online normalization.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|it should not that make a big difference.|S|Bro027|0
me018|what if you used a smaller window for the delta?|Q|Bro027|1
mn007|because|D|Bro027|0
me018|could that help a little bit?|Q|Bro027|1
me018|i mean i guess there's a lot of things you could do to|D|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|but nnn|F|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so if you if you put the delta before the uh online if|D|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|F|Bro027|1
me013|uh then then it could go in parallel.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|because|D|Bro027|0
me013|and then then you don't have that additive.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|yep.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|because the time constant of the online normalization is pretty long compared to the delta window.|S|Bro027|1
me013|okay.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|so|F|Bro027|1
mn007|it should not make|D|Bro027|1
me013|okay.|S|Bro027|0
me013|and you ought to be able to shove uh uh pull off twenty milliseconds from somewhere else to get it under two hundred.|S|Bro027|0
me013|right?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|i mean|F|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro027|1
me018|is two hundred the|D|Bro027|0
me013|the hundred|D|Bro027|1
me013|a hundred milliseconds for smoothing is sort of an arbitrary amount.|S|Bro027|1
me013|it could be eighty.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and and probably do.|D|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me018|a|D|Bro027|1
me018|uh|F|Bro027|1
me018|what's the baseline you need to be under?|Q|Bro027|1
me018|two hundred.|S|Bro027|1
me013|well we don't know.|S|Bro027|0
me013|they're still arguing about it.|S|Bro027|0
me018|oh.|S|Bro027|1
me013|i mean if it's two if if it's uh if it's two fifty then we could keep the delta where it is if we shaved off twenty.|S|Bro027|0
me013|if it's two hundred if we shaved off twenty we could we could uh meet it by moving the delta back.|S|Bro027|0
me018|so how do you know that what you have is too much if they're still deciding?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|uh we don't.|S|Bro027|0
me013|but it's just|D|Bro027|0
me013|i mean the main thing is that since that we got burned last time and you know by not worrying about it very much we're just staying conscious of it.|S|Bro027|0
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me018|oh okay.|S|Bro027|1
me018|i see.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and so|D|Bro027|0
me013|i mean if if if a week before we have to be done someone says well you have to have fifty milliseconds less than you have now it would be pretty frantic around here.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so|F|Bro027|0
me018|uh okay.|S|Bro027|1
me013|uh|F|Bro027|0
me018|but still that's that's a pretty big uh win.|S|Bro027|1
me018|and it doesn't seem like you're in terms of your delay you're uh that|D|Bro027|1
me013|he added a bit on.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|huh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|i guess because before we were we were had were able to have the noise uh stuff uh and the l.v.a. be in parallel.|S|Bro027|0
me013|and now he's he's requiring it to be done first.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|well i think the main thing maybe is the cleaning of the speech which takes forty milliseconds or so.|S|Bro027|1
me013|right.|S|Bro027|0
me013|well so you say|D|Bro027|0
mn007|and|F|Bro027|1
me013|let's say ten milliseconds seconds for the l.d.a.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|and but the l.d.a. is well pretty short right now.|S|Bro027|1
me013|well ten.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro027|1
me013|and then forty for the other.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah the l.d.a.l.d.a. we don't know is like is it very crucial for the features right?|S|Bro027|1
mn007|no.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|i just|D|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|this is the first try.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|i mean i maybe the l.d.a.'s not very useful then.|S|Bro027|0
me013|right.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so you could start pulling back.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but|D|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|but i think you have|D|Bro027|1
me013|i mean you have twenty for delta computation.|S|Bro027|1
me013|which now you're sort of doing twice.|S|Bro027|1
me013|right?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|but were you doing that before?|Q|Bro027|1
mn007|huh.|F|Bro027|0
mn052|on the in the|D|Bro027|1
mn007|well in the proposal um the input of the v.a.d. network were just three frames i think.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|just|D|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah just the static no delta.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uh static features.|S|Bro027|0
me013|right.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so what you have now is uh forty for the the noise twenty for the delta and ten for the l.d.a.|S|Bro027|1
me013|that's seventy milliseconds of stuff which was formerly in parallel.|S|Bro027|1
me013|right?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|so i think|D|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|you know that's that's the difference as far as the timing.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|right?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|um|F|Bro027|1
me013|and you could experiment with cutting various pieces of these back a bit.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but|D|Bro027|1
me013|i mean we're we're not we're not in terrible shape.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me018|that's what it seems like to me.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me018|it's pretty good.|S|Bro027|1
me013|it's it's not like it's adding up to four hundred milliseconds or something.|S|Bro027|0
me018|where where is this where is this fifty seven point o. two in in comparison to the last evaluation?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|well it's i think it's better than anything uh anybody got.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me018|oh is that right?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|the best was fifty four point five.|S|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn052|point|D|Bro027|1
me018|oh.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|and our system was forty nine.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|but with the neural network.|S|Bro027|0
me018|wow!|S|Bro027|1
me018|so this is almost ten percent.|S|Bro027|1
me013|with the with the neural net.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me013|and and|D|Bro027|0
mn007|it|D|Bro027|1
mn052|so this is this is like the first proposal.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|the proposal one.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|it was forty four actually.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and we still don't have the neural net in.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so so it's|D|Bro027|1
me018|wow!|S|Bro027|0
me013|you know.|F|Bro027|1
me013|so it's|D|Bro027|1
me013|we're we're doing better.|S|Bro027|1
me013|i mean we're getting better recognition.|S|Bro027|1
me018|this is this is really good.|S|Bro027|0
me013|i mean i'm sure other people working on this are not sitting still either.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but|F|Bro027|1
me013|but|F|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|but uh|F|Bro027|1
me013|uh|F|Bro027|1
me013|i mean the important thing is that we learn how to do this better.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and you know|F|Bro027|1
me013|so|F|Bro027|1
me013|um|F|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|F|Bro027|1
me013|so our|D|Bro027|1
me013|um|F|Bro027|1
me013|yeah you can see the kind of kind of numbers that we're having say on speechdat-car.|S|Bro027|1
me013|which is a hard task.|S|Bro027|1
me013|because it's really um i think it's just sort of sort of reasonable numbers starting to be.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|i mean it's still|D|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah even for a well matched case it's sixty percent error rate reduction.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|which is|D|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|probably half.|S|Bro027|1
me013|good.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|um|F|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|so actually this is in between what we had with the previous v.a.d. and what sunil did with an i.d.l.v.a.d.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|which gave sixty two percent improvement right?|S|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah it's almost that.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|so|F|Bro027|0
mn052|it's almost an average.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|somewhere around|D|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|F|Bro027|1
me018|what was that?|Q|Bro027|0
me018|say that last part again.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|so if you use like an i.d.l.v.a.d. uh for dropping the frames|D|Bro027|1
mn052|or the best we can get.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|the best that we can get that means that we estimate the silence probability on the clean version of the utterances.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|then you can go up to sixty two percent error rate reduction globally.|S|Bro027|1
me018|huh.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|huh.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro027|1
me018|so that would be even that wouldn't change this number down here to sixty two?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so you you were|D|Bro027|0
mn007|if you add a good very good v.a.d. that works as well as a v.a.d. working on clean speech.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|then you you would go|D|Bro027|1
me018|so that's sort of the best you could hope for.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro027|1
me013|probably yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me018|i see.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so fifty three is what you were getting with the old v.a.d.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and uh|F|Bro027|0
me013|and sixty two with the the you know quote unquote cheating v.a.d.|S|Bro027|0
me013|and fifty seven is what you got with the real v.a.d.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro027|1
me013|that's great.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uh yeah the next thing is i started to play|D|Bro027|1
mn007|well i don't want to worry too much about the delay.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|no.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|maybe it's better to wait.|S|Bro027|1
me013|okay.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|for the decision.|S|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|from the committee.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uh but i started to play with the um uh tandem neural network.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|huh|F|Bro027|1
mn007|i just did the configuration that's very similar to what we did for the february proposal.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|and|F|Bro027|1
mn007|um|F|Bro027|1
mn007|so there is a a first feature stream that use uh straight m.f.c.c. features.|S|Bro027|1
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|well these features actually.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|and the other stream is the output of a neural network using as input also these um cleaned m.f.c.c.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|um|F|Bro027|1
mn007|i don't have the|D|Bro027|1
me018|those are those are what is going into the tandem net?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|huh.|F|Bro027|1
me018|those two.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|so there is just this feature stream the fifteen m.f.c.c. plus delta and double delta.|S|Bro027|1
me013|no.|S|Bro027|0
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|um so it's makes forty five features that are used as input to the h.t.k.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|and then there is there are more inputs that comes from the tandem m.l.p.|S|Bro027|0
me018|oh oh.|S|Bro027|1
me018|okay.|S|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me018|i see.|S|Bro027|1
me013|he likes to use them both.|S|Bro027|0
me013|because then it has one part that's discriminative.|S|Bro027|0
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|um|B|Bro027|0
me013|one part that's not.|S|Bro027|1
me018|right.|S|Bro027|0
me018|okay.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|so um|F|Bro027|1
mn007|uh yeah.|F|Bro027|1
mn007|right now it seems that i just tested on speechdat-car while the experiment are running on your on t.i. digits.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|well it improves on the well matched and the mismatched conditions.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|but it get worse on the highly mismatched.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|um|F|Bro027|1
me018|compared to these numbers?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|compared to these numbers yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|um|F|Bro027|1
mn007|like on the well match and medium mismatch the gain is around five percent relative.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|but it goes down a lot more like fifteen percent on the h.m. case.|S|Bro027|1
me013|you're just using the full ninety features?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|the|D|Bro027|1
me013|you have ninety features?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|i have|D|Bro027|1
mn007|um|F|Bro027|1
mn007|from the networks it's twenty eight.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|so|D|Bro027|1
me013|and from the other side it's forty five.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|so it's forty five.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so it's you have seventy three features.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and you're just feeding them like that.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro027|1
me013|there isn't any k.l.t. or anything?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|there's a k.l.t. after the neural network as as before.|S|Bro027|1
me018|that's how you get down to twenty eight?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me018|why twenty eight?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|i don't know.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uh|F|Bro027|1
me018|oh.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|it's it's because it's what we did for the first proposal.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|we tested uh trying to go down.|S|Bro027|1
me018|uh.|S|Bro027|0
me013|it's a multiple of seven.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|and|F|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|so|F|Bro027|0
mn007|um|F|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|i wanted to do something very similar to the proposal as a first first try.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me018|i see.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me018|that makes sense.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|but we have to for sure we have to go down.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|because the limit is now sixty features.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|so|F|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|uh|F|Bro027|1
mn007|we have to find a way to decrease the number of features.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|um|F|Bro027|1
me018|so it seems funny that i don't know maybe i don't quite understand everything but that adding features|D|Bro027|0
me018|i guess i guess if you're keeping the back end fixed.|S|Bro027|0
me018|maybe that's it.|S|Bro027|0
me018|because it seems like just adding information shouldn't give worse results.|S|Bro027|0
me018|but i guess if you're keeping the number of gaussians fixed in the recognizer then|D|Bro027|0
me013|well yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|huh.|D|Bro027|0
me013|but i mean just in general adding information|D|Bro027|1
me013|suppose the information you added well was a really terrible feature and all it brought in was noise.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|right?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|so so um|F|Bro027|1
me013|or or suppose it wasn't completely terrible.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but it was completely equivalent to another one feature that you had.|S|Bro027|1
me013|except it was noisier.|S|Bro027|1
me018|uhhuh.|S|Bro027|0
me013|right?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|in that case you wouldn't necessarily expect it to be better at all.|S|Bro027|1
me018|oh yeah i wasn't necessarily saying it should be better.|S|Bro027|0
me018|i'm just surprised that you're getting fifteen percent relative worse on the|D|Bro027|0
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|but it's worse.|S|Bro027|0
me013|on the highly mismatched condition.|S|Bro027|1
me018|on the highly mismatch.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah i|D|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|F|Bro027|0
me013|so highly mismatched condition means that in fact your training is a bad estimate of your test.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|so having having uh a a a greater number of features if they aren't maybe the right features that you use certainly can can easily uh make things worse.|S|Bro027|1
me013|i mean you're right.|S|Bro027|1
me013|if you have if you have uh lots and lots of data and you have and your your your training is representative of your test then getting more sources of information should just help.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but but it's it doesn't necessarily work that way.|S|Bro027|1
me018|huh.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|so i wonder|D|Bro027|0
me013|um|F|Bro027|0
me013|well what's your what's your thought about what to do next with it?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|um|F|Bro027|1
mn007|i don't know.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|i'm surprised.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|because i expected the neural net to help more when there is more mismatch as it was the case for the.|S|Bro027|1
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
mn052|so was the training set same as the the february proposal?|Q|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah it's the same training set.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|so it's timit with the t.i. digits' uh noises uh added.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|okay.|B|Bro027|1
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|um|F|Bro027|1
me013|well we might uh we might have to experiment with uh better training sets.|S|Bro027|0
me013|again.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|but|D|Bro027|0
me013|i the other thing is i mean before you found that was the best configuration but you might have to retest those things now that we have different the rest of it is different.|S|Bro027|0
me013|right?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|so|F|Bro027|0
me013|um|F|Bro027|0
me013|uh|F|Bro027|0
me013|for instance what's the effect of just putting the neural net on without the other other path?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|i mean you know what the straight features do.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me013|that gives you this.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|you know what it does in combination.|S|Bro027|0
me013|you don't necessarily know what|D|Bro027|0
me018|what if you did the|D|Bro027|1
me018|would it make sense to do the k.l.t. on the full set of combined features?|Q|Bro027|1
me018|instead of just on the|D|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|i i guess.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|um|F|Bro027|0
mn007|the reason i did it this ways is that in february it we we tested different things like that.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|so having two k.l.t. having just a k.l.t. for a network or having a global k.l.t.|S|Bro027|0
me018|oh i see.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|and|F|Bro027|0
me018|so you tried the global k.l.t. before.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|well|F|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me018|and it didn't really|D|Bro027|1
mn007|and uh|D|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|the differences between these configurations were not huge.|S|Bro027|0
me018|i see.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|but it was marginally better with this configuration.|S|Bro027|0
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|but yeah that's obviously another thing to try.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|um|F|Bro027|1
me013|since things are things are different.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|and i guess if the|D|Bro027|0
me013|these are all|D|Bro027|0
me013|so all of these seventy three features are going into um the uh the h.m.m.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and is are are are any deltas being computed of of them?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|of the straight features yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|so|D|Bro027|1
me013|not of the|D|Bro027|0
mn007|but the um|F|Bro027|1
mn007|tandem features are used as they are.|S|Bro027|1
me013|are not.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|so|F|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah maybe we can add some context from these features also as dan did in in his last work.|S|Bro027|1
me013|could.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|but the other thing i was thinking was|D|Bro027|0
me013|um|F|Bro027|0
me013|uh now i lost track of what i was thinking.|S|Bro027|0
me013|but|F|Bro027|0
me018|what is the|D|Bro027|1
me018|you said there was a limit of sixty features or something?|Q|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro027|0
me018|what's the relation between that limit and the um forty eight uh forty eight hundred bits per second?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|oh.|S|Bro027|0
me013|i know what i was going to say.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|um not no relation.|S|Bro027|1
me013|no relation.|S|Bro027|0
me018|so i i i don't understand.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|the the forty eight hundred bits is for transmission of some features.|S|Bro027|0
me018|because|D|Bro027|1
me018|i mean if you're only using|D|Bro027|1
mn007|and generally it allows you to transmit like fifteen uh cepstrum.|S|Bro027|0
me013|the issue was that um this is supposed to be a standard that's then going to be fed to somebody's recognizer somewhere.|S|Bro027|1
me013|which might be you know it it might be a concern how many parameters are use used and so forth.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and so|F|Bro027|1
me013|uh|F|Bro027|1
me013|they felt they wanted to set a limit.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so they chose sixty.|S|Bro027|1
me013|some people wanted to use hundreds of parameters.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and and that bothered some other people.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and so|F|Bro027|1
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|they just chose that.|S|Bro027|1
me013|i i i think it's kind of arbitrary too.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but but that's that's kind of what was chosen.|S|Bro027|1
me013|i i remembered what i was going to say.|S|Bro027|1
me013|what i was going to say is that um maybe maybe with the noise removal uh these things are now more correlated.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so you have two sets of things that are kind of uncorrelated uh within themselves.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but they're pretty correlated with one another.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|and um|F|Bro027|1
me013|they're being fed into these uh variants only gaussians and so forth.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and and uh|F|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|so maybe it would be a better idea now than it was before to uh have uh one k.l.t. over everything.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|to de correlate it.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah i see.|S|Bro027|0
me013|maybe.|S|Bro027|1
me013|you know.|F|Bro027|1
mn052|what are the s.n.r.'s in the training set timit?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|it's uh ranging from zero to clean.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|from zero to clean.|S|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|so we found this this uh this macrophone data and so forth that we were using for these other experiments to be pretty good.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|so that's after you explore these other alternatives that might be another way to start looking is is just improving the training set.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|i mean we were getting uh lots better recognition using that than|D|Bro027|0
me013|of course you do have the problem that um we are not able to increase the number of gaussians uh or anything to uh uh to match anything.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so we're only improving the training of our feature set.|S|Bro027|0
me013|but that's still probably something.|S|Bro027|0
me018|so you're saying add the macrophone data to the training of the neural net ? the tandem net?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|that's the only place that we can train.|S|Bro027|0
me013|we can't train the other stuff with anything other than the standard amount.|S|Bro027|0
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me018|right.|B|Bro027|1
me013|so|F|Bro027|0
me013|um|F|Bro027|0
me013|um|F|Bro027|0
me018|what what was it trained on again?|Q|Bro027|1
me018|the one that you used.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|it's timit with noise.|S|Bro027|0
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|so yeah it's rather a small.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|um|F|Bro027|0
me013|how big is the net by the way?|Q|Bro027|1
mn007|uh it's uh five hundred hidden units.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|and|F|Bro027|0
me013|and again you did experiments back then where you made it bigger.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and it and that was that was sort of the threshold point.|S|Bro027|1
me013|much less than that it was worse.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|and|D|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|much more than that it wasn't much better.|S|Bro027|1
me013|huh.|F|Bro027|1
mn052|so is it is it though the performance big relation in the high high mismatch has something to do with the uh cleaning up that you that is done on the timit after adding noise?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|so|F|Bro027|0
mn052|it's all the noises are from the t.i. digits.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|right?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|so you|D|Bro027|0
mn007|um|F|Bro027|1
mn052|well it's like the high mismatch of the speechdat-car.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|they uh|D|Bro027|1
mn052|after cleaning up maybe having more noise than the the training set of timit after clean after you do the noise cleanup.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|huh.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|i mean earlier you never had any compensation.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|you just trained it straight away.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|so it had like all these different conditions of s.n.r.'s actually in their training set of neural net.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|but after cleaning up you have now a different set of s.n.r.'s right?|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|for the training of the neural net.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|and|F|Bro027|0
mn052|is it something to do with the mismatch that that's created after the cleaning up like the high mismatch?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|you mean the the most noisy occurrences on speechdat-car might be a lot more noisy than|D|Bro027|1
mn052|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
mn052|of that|D|Bro027|0
mn052|i mean the s.n.r. after the noise compensation of the speechdat-car.|S|Bro027|0
me013|oh.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so right.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so the training the the neural net is being trained with noise compensated stuff.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|maybe.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me013|which makes sense.|S|Bro027|0
me013|but uh you're saying yeah the noisier ones are still going to be even after our noise compensation are still going to be pretty noisy.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah so now the after noise compensation the neural net is seeing a different set of s.n.r.'s than that was originally there in the training set of timit.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|because in the timit it was zero to some clean.|S|Bro027|1
me013|right.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yes.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|so the net saw all the s.n.r. conditions.|S|Bro027|1
me013|right.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|now after cleaning up it's a different set of s.n.r.|S|Bro027|1
me013|right.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|and that s.n.r. may not be like covering the whole set of s.n.r.'s that you're getting in the speechdat-car.|S|Bro027|1
me013|right.|S|Bro027|0
me013|but the speechdat-car data that you're seeing is also reduced in noise.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah yeah yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|by the noise compensation.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah it is.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|but i'm saying there could be some some issues of.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so|F|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|well if the initial range of s.n.r. is different we the problem was already there before.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|and|D|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|because|D|Bro027|0
mn007|huh|B|Bro027|0
me013|yeah i mean it depends on whether you believe that the noise compensation is equally reducing the noise on the test set and the training set.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|huh.|B|Bro027|0
mn052|on the test set yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|uh|F|Bro027|0
me013|right?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|i mean you're saying there's a mismatch in noise that wasn't there before.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|huh.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|but if they were both the same before then if they were both reduced equally then there would not be a mismatch.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so|F|Bro027|0
me013|i mean this may be|D|Bro027|0
me013|heaven forbid this noise compensation process may be imperfect.|S|Bro027|0
me013|but|F|Bro027|0
me013|uh|F|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah uh|D|Bro027|1
mn052|well i|F|Bro027|0
me013|so maybe it's treating some things differently.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|i don't know.|F|Bro027|0
mn052|i i just that could be seen from the t.i. digits uh testing condition.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|because um the noises are from the t.i. digits right?|S|Bro027|0
mn052|noise.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|so|F|Bro027|1
mn052|so cleaning up the t.i. digits.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|and if the performance goes down in the t.i. digits mismatch high mismatch like this|D|Bro027|0
mn007|clean training yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|on a clean training or zero d.b. testing.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah we'll so we'll see.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uh|F|Bro027|1
mn052|then it's something to do.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|maybe.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me013|i mean one of the things about|D|Bro027|0
me013|i mean the macrophone data um i think you know it was recorded over many different telephones.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|and um|F|Bro027|0
me013|so there's lots of different kinds of acoustic conditions.|S|Bro027|0
me013|i mean it's not artificially added noise or anything.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so it's not the same.|S|Bro027|0
me013|i don't think there's anybody recording over a car from a car.|S|Bro027|0
me013|but i think it's it's varied enough that if if doing this adjustments uh and playing around with it doesn't uh make it better the most uh it seems like the most obvious thing to do is to improve the training set.|S|Bro027|0
me013|um|F|Bro027|0
me013|i mean what we were|D|Bro027|0
me013|uh the condition it it gave us an enormous amount of improvement in what we were doing with meeting recorder digits.|S|Bro027|0
me013|even though there again these macrophone digits were very very different from uh what we were going on here.|S|Bro027|0
me013|i mean we weren't talking over a telephone here.|S|Bro027|0
me013|but it was just i think just having a a nice variation in acoustic conditions was just a good thing.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|yep.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|huh.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah actually to uh what i observed in the h.m. case is that the number of deletion dramatically increases.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|it it doubles.|S|Bro027|1
me013|number of deletions.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|when i added the the neural network it doubles the number of deletions.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah so i don't you know how to interpret that.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|but huh|F|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|me either.|S|Bro027|0
me018|and and did other numbers stay the same?|Q|Bro027|1
me018|insertion substitutions stay the same?|Q|Bro027|1
mn007|they stayed the same.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|they maybe they are a little bit uh lower.|S|Bro027|0
me018|roughly.|S|Bro027|1
me018|uhhuh.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|they are a little bit better.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah but|F|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|did they increase the number of deletions even for the cases that got better?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|say for the i mean it|D|Bro027|1
mn007|no it doesn't.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|no.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so it's only the highly mismatched.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and it remind me again.|S|Bro027|1
me013|the highly mismatched means that the|D|Bro027|1
mn007|clean training and|D|Bro027|0
me013|uh sorry?|Q|Bro027|1
mn007|it's clean training|D|Bro027|0
mn007|well close microphone training and distant microphone um high speed i think.|S|Bro027|0
me013|close mike training.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|well.|F|Bro027|0
mn007|the most noisy cases are the distant microphone for testing.|S|Bro027|0
me013|right.|B|Bro027|1
me013|so|F|Bro027|1
me013|well maybe the noise subtraction is subtracting off speech.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|separating.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|but|F|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|i mean but without the neural network it's well it's better.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|it's just when we add the neural networks.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|the feature are the same except that|D|Bro027|0
me013|yeah right.|S|Bro027|1
me013|uh that's right that's right.|S|Bro027|1
me013|um|F|Bro027|1
me018|well that that says that you know the um the models in in uh the recognizer are really paying attention to the neural net features.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro027|1
me018|uh|F|Bro027|0
me013|but yeah.|F|Bro027|1
me013|actually the timit noises are sort of a range of noises.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and they're not so much the stationary driving kind of noises right?|S|Bro027|1
me013|it's it's pretty different.|S|Bro027|1
me013|isn't it?|Q|Bro027|1
mn007|uh there is a car noise.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|so there are just four noises.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|um|F|Bro027|0
mn007|uh car i think.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|babble.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|babble.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|subway right?|S|Bro027|0
mn007|and|F|Bro027|0
mn052|street or airport or something.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|and street isn't|D|Bro027|0
mn052|or train station.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|train station yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|so it's mostly well car is stationary.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|babble it's a stationary background plus some voices.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|some speech over it.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|and the other two are rather stationary also.|S|Bro027|0
me013|well i i think that if you run it|D|Bro027|1
me013|actually you maybe you remember this.|S|Bro027|1
me013|when you in in the old experiments when you ran with the neural net only and didn't have this side path um uh with the the pure features as well did it make things better to have the neural net?|Q|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|was it about the same?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|uh|F|Bro027|1
mn007|it was a little bit worse.|S|Bro027|0
me013|than|D|Bro027|1
mn007|than just the features.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro027|0
me013|so|F|Bro027|1
me013|until you put the second path in with the pure features the neural net wasn't helping at all.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro027|0
me013|well that's interesting.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|it was helping uh if the features are were bad.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|i mean|F|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|just plain p.l.p.'s or m.f.c.c.'s.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|but|F|Bro027|0
mn007|as soon as we added l.d.a. online normalization and all these things then|D|Bro027|0
me013|they were doing similar enough things.|S|Bro027|1
me013|well i still think it would be sort of interesting to see what would happen if you just had the neural net without the side thing.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|and and the thing i i have in mind is uh maybe you'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse.|S|Bro027|1
me013|maybe that they're a lot worse.|S|Bro027|1
me013|you know?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|and um|F|Bro027|1
me013|but if on the other hand uh it's say somewhere in between what you're seeing now and and and uh what you'd have with just the pure features then maybe there is some problem of a of a uh combination of these things or correlation between them somehow.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|if it really is that the net is hurting you at the moment then i think the issue is to focus on on uh improving the the net.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|um|F|Bro027|1
me013|so what's the overall|D|Bro027|1
me013|i mean you haven't done all the experiments.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but you said it was somewhat better say five percent better for the first two conditions and fifteen percent worse for the other one?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|but it's but of course that one's weighted lower.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah oh.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|so i wonder what the net effect is.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|i i i think it's it was one or two percent.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|that's not that bad.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|but it was like two percent relative worse on speechdat-car.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|i have to to check that.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|well i have i will.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|well it will overall it will be still better.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|even if it is fifteen percent worse.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|because the fifteen percent worse is given like twenty five point two five eight.|S|Bro027|1
me013|right.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|huh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|right.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so the so the worst it could be if the others were exactly the same is four.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|is it like|D|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah so it's four.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and and uh in fact since the others are somewhat better|D|Bro027|0
mn052|is|D|Bro027|1
mn052|so either it'll get cancelled out or you'll get like almost the same.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah it was it was slightly worse.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uh|D|Bro027|1
mn052|slightly bad.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|D|Bro027|0
mn007|um|F|Bro027|1
me013|yeah it should be pretty close to cancelled out.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me018|you know i've been wondering about something.|S|Bro027|1
me018|in the um a lot of the um the hub five systems um recently have been using l.d.a.|S|Bro027|1
me018|and and they um they run l.d.a. on the features right before they train the models.|S|Bro027|1
me018|so there's the the l.d.a. is is right there before the h.m.m.'s.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me018|so you guys are using l.d.a.|S|Bro027|1
me018|but it seems like it's pretty far back in the process.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|uh this l.d.a. is different from the l.d.a. that you are talking about.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|the l.d.a. that you saying is like you take a block of features like nine frames or something and then do an l.d.a. on it.|S|Bro027|0
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|and then reduce the dimensionality to something like twenty four or something like that.|S|Bro027|0
me018|yeah you you you can.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|and then feed it to h.m.m.|S|Bro027|0
me018|i mean it's you know you're just basically|D|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah so this is like a two two dimensional tile.|S|Bro027|0
me018|you're shifting the feature space.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|F|Bro027|1
mn052|so this is a two dimensional tile.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|and the l.d.a. that we are applying is only in time.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|not in frequency.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|high cost frequency.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|so it's like more like a filtering in time.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|rather than doing a|D|Bro027|0
me018|uh okay.|S|Bro027|1
me018|so what what about um what|D|Bro027|1
me018|i mean i don't know if this is a good idea or not.|S|Bro027|1
me018|but what if you put ran the other kind of l.d.a. uh on your features right before they go into the h.m. m?|Q|Bro027|1
mn052|uh it|D|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|no actually i think|D|Bro027|1
mn007|well.|F|Bro027|1
mn007|what do we do with the a.n.n. is is something like that.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|except that it's not linear.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|but it's it's like a nonlinear discriminant analysis.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me018|right.|S|Bro027|0
me018|it's the it's|D|Bro027|0
me018|right.|S|Bro027|0
me018|the so|D|Bro027|0
mn007|but|D|Bro027|1
me018|yeah so it's sort of like|D|Bro027|0
me018|the tandem stuff is kind of like nonlinear l.d.a.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|it's|D|Bro027|1
me018|i|D|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me018|yeah.|F|Bro027|1
mn007|uh|F|Bro027|0
me018|but i mean but the other features that you have um the non tandem ones|D|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah i know.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|that that yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|well in the proposal they were transformed using p.c.a.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|but|F|Bro027|0
me018|uhhuh.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah it might be that l.d.a. could be better.|S|Bro027|0
me013|the the argument is kind of in|D|Bro027|1
me013|and it's not like we really know.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but the argument anyway is that um uh we always have the|D|Bro027|1
me013|i mean discriminative things are good.|S|Bro027|1
me013|l.d.a. neural nets they're good.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|uh they're good because you you you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and p.c.a. doesn't do that.|S|Bro027|1
me013|it p.a.p.c.a. low order p.c.a. throws away pieces that are uh maybe not not going to be helpful just because they're small basically.|S|Bro027|1
me018|right.|B|Bro027|0
me013|but uh the problem is training sets aren't perfect and testing sets are different.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so you you you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff be it l.d.a. or neural nets that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but what you're really going to be getting is is something else.|S|Bro027|1
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|and so uh stephane's idea was uh let's feed uh both this discriminatively trained thing and something that's not.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so you have a good set of features that everybody's worked really hard to make.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|and then uh you you discriminately train it.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but you also take the path that that doesn't have that.|S|Bro027|1
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|and putting those in together.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and that that|D|Bro027|1
me013|so it's kind of like a combination of the uh what uh dan has been calling you know a feature uh you know a feature combination versus posterior combination or something.|S|Bro027|1
me013|it's it's you know you have the posterior combination.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but then you get the features from that and use them as a feature combination with these these other things.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and that seemed at least in the last one as he was just saying he he when he only did discriminative stuff it actually was was it didn't help at all in this particular case.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|there was enough of a difference i guess between the testing and training.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but by having them both there|D|Bro027|1
me013|the fact is some of the time the discriminative stuff is going to help you.|S|Bro027|1
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|and some of the time it's going to hurt you.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and by combining two information sources if you know if if|D|Bro027|1
me018|right.|B|Bro027|0
me018|so you wouldn't necessarily then want to do l.d.a. on the non tandem features because now you're doing something to them that|D|Bro027|0
me013|that|D|Bro027|1
me013|i think that's counter to that idea.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|now again it's we're just trying these different things.|S|Bro027|1
me018|right.|B|Bro027|0
me013|we don't really know what's going to work best.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but if that's the hypothesis at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that.|S|Bro027|1
me018|right.|B|Bro027|0
me013|um|F|Bro027|1
me013|and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than l.d.a.|S|Bro027|1
me018|right.|B|Bro027|0
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|though maybe not.|S|Bro027|1
me018|well|F|Bro027|0
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me018|exactly.|S|Bro027|0
me018|i mean we uh we were getting ready to do the tandem uh stuff for the hub five system.|S|Bro027|0
me018|and um andreas and i talked about it.|S|Bro027|0
me018|and the idea the thought was well uh yeah that you know the neural net should be better.|S|Bro027|0
me018|but we should at least have uh a number you know to show that we did try the l.d.a. in place of the neural net.|S|Bro027|0
me018|so that we can you know show a clear path.|S|Bro027|0
me013|right.|S|Bro027|1
me018|you know that you have it without it.|S|Bro027|0
me018|then you have the l.d.a.|S|Bro027|0
me018|then you have the neural net.|S|Bro027|0
me018|and you can see theoretically.|S|Bro027|0
me018|so|F|Bro027|0
me018|i was just wondering|D|Bro027|0
me018|i i|D|Bro027|0
me013|well i think that's a good idea.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|did did you do that?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|or that's a|D|Bro027|1
me018|um no.|S|Bro027|0
me018|that's what that's what we're going to do next.|S|Bro027|0
me018|as soon as i finish this other thing.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me018|so|F|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|no well that's a good idea.|S|Bro027|1
me013|i i|D|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|D|Bro027|1
me018|we just want to show.|S|Bro027|0
me018|i mean it everybody believes it.|S|Bro027|0
me013|oh no.|S|Bro027|1
me013|it's a|D|Bro027|1
me018|but you know we just|D|Bro027|0
me013|no no.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but it might not not even be true.|S|Bro027|1
me013|i mean it's it's it's it's it's a great idea.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|i mean one of the things that always disturbed me uh in the the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that um a lot of people because neural nets were pretty easy to to use a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without uh looking at all into the linear uh uh versions of them.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|and uh people were doing recurrent nets but not looking at i.i.r. filters.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|and you know i mean uh|F|Bro027|1
me013|so i think yeah it's definitely a good idea to try it.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me018|and everybody's putting that on their systems now.|S|Bro027|0
me018|and so|D|Bro027|0
me018|that's what made me wonder about this.|S|Bro027|0
me013|well they've been putting them in their systems off and on for ten years.|S|Bro027|1
me018|but|F|Bro027|0
me013|but but but uh|F|Bro027|1
me018|yeah what i mean is it's it's like in the hub five evaluations you know.|S|Bro027|0
me018|and you read the system descriptions and everybody's got you know l.d.a. on their features.|S|Bro027|0
me013|and now they all have that.|S|Bro027|1
me013|i see.|S|Bro027|1
me018|and so.|F|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me018|uh|F|Bro027|0
mn007|it's the transformation they're estimating on.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|well they are trained on the same data as the final h.m.m. are.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah so it's different.|S|Bro027|0
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me018|exactly.|S|Bro027|0
me018|because they don't have these you know mismatches that that you guys have.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me018|so that's why i was wondering if maybe it's not even a good idea.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me018|i don't know.|S|Bro027|0
me018|i i don't know enough about it.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me018|but um|F|Bro027|0
me013|i mean part of why|D|Bro027|1
me013|i i think part of why you were getting into the k.l.t. you were describing to me at one point that you wanted to see if uh you know getting good orthogonal features was and combining the the different temporal ranges was the key thing that was happening or whether it was this discriminant thing right?|S|Bro027|1
me013|so you were just trying|D|Bro027|1
me013|i think you|D|Bro027|1
me013|i mean this is it doesn't have the l.d.a. aspect.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but as far as the orthogonalizing transformation you were trying that at one point right?|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro027|0
me013|i think you were.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|does something.|S|Bro027|1
me013|it doesn't work as well.|S|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|so yeah.|F|Bro027|0
mn052|i've been exploring a parallel v.a.d. without neural network.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|with like less latency using s.n.r. and energy um after the cleaning up.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|so what i'd been trying was um|D|Bro027|0
mn052|uh|F|Bro027|0
mn052|after the after the noise compensation i was trying to find a feature based on the ratio of the energies that is after clean and before clean.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|so that if if they are like pretty close to one which means it's speech.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|and if it is if it is close to zero which is so it's like a scale probability value.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|so i was trying uh with full band and multiple bands.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|uh separating them to different frequency bands.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|and deriving separate decisions on each bands and trying to combine them.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|uh|F|Bro027|0
mn052|the advantage being like it doesn't have the latency of the neural net if it if it can.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|and it gave me like uh one point one more than one percent relative improvement.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|so from fifty three point six it went to fifty four point eight.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|so it's like only slightly more than a percent improvement.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|just like|D|Bro027|0
mn052|which means that it's it's doing a slightly better job than the previous v.a.d.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|uh at a lower delay.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|um|F|Bro027|0
mn052|so um|F|Bro027|0
mn052|so|F|Bro027|0
me013|but|F|Bro027|1
me013|i'm sorry.|S|Bro027|1
me013|does it still have the median filter stuff?|Q|Bro027|1
mn052|it still has the median filter.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so it still has most of the delay.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|so|D|Bro027|0
me013|it just doesn't|D|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|so with the delay that's gone is the input which is the sixty millisecond.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|the forty plus twenty.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|at the input of the neural net you have this uh nine frames of context plus the delta.|S|Bro027|0
me013|well|F|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|oh plus the delta.|S|Bro027|1
me013|right.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|okay.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|so that delay plus the l.d.a.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|uh so the delay is only the forty millisecond of the noise cleaning plus the hundred millisecond smoothing at the output.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|um|F|Bro027|0
mn052|so yeah.|F|Bro027|0
mn052|so the the the biggest|D|Bro027|0
mn052|the problem for me was to find a consistent threshold that works well across the different databases.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|because i i try to make it work on speechdat-car.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|and it fails on t.i. digits.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|or if i try to make it work on that it's just the italian or something it doesn't work on the finnish.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|so|F|Bro027|0
mn052|um|F|Bro027|0
mn052|so there are there was like some problem in balancing the deletions and insertions when i try different thresholds.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|so|F|Bro027|0
mn052|the|D|Bro027|0
mn052|i'm still trying to make it better by using some other features from the after the clean up.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|maybe some uh correlation auto correlation or some additional features of to mainly the improvement of the vad i've been trying.|S|Bro027|0
me013|now this this this uh before and after clean it sounds like you think that's a good feature.|S|Bro027|1
me013|that that it you think that the uh the it appears to be a good feature right?|S|Bro027|1
mn052|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|what about using it in the neural net?|Q|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|eventually we could could just|D|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|so yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|so that's the|D|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|so we've been thinking about putting it into the neural net also.|S|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn052|because they did that itself.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|then you don't have to worry about the thresholds and|D|Bro027|0
mn052|there's a threshold.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|and yeah.|F|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah.|F|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn052|so that that's uh|F|Bro027|1
mn007|but just|D|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so if we if we can live with the latency or cut the latencies elsewhere then then that would be a uh good thing.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|um anybody has anybody you guys or or naren uh somebody tried the uh um second second stream thing?|Q|Bro027|1
mn052|oh i just i just put the second stream in place and uh ran one experiment.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uh|F|Bro027|1
mn052|but just like just to know that everything is fine.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|so it was like uh forty five cepstrum plus twenty three mel log mel.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|and and just like it gave me the baseline performance of the aurora.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|which is like zero improvement.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|so i just tried it on italian just to know that everything is.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|but i i didn't export anything out of it.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|because it was like a weird feature set.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|so|F|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|F|Bro027|1
me013|well what i think you know would be more what you'd want to do is is is uh put it into another neural net.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah yeah yeah yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|right?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|and then|D|Bro027|0
me013|but|F|Bro027|0
me013|yeah we're we're not quite there yet.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so we have to figure out the neural nets i guess.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|the uh other thing i was wondering was um if the neural net um has any because of the different noise unseen noise conditions for the neural net.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|where like you train it on those four noise conditions while you are feeding it with like additional some four plus some few more conditions which it hasn't seen actually.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|from the while testing.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|right.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|um|F|Bro027|0
mn052|instead of just having uh those cleaned up cepstrum should we feed some additional information like the the|D|Bro027|0
mn052|we have the v.a.d. flag.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|i mean should we feed the v.a.d. flag also at the input so that it it has some additional discriminating information at the input?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|um|F|Bro027|1
me013|uh the the v.a.d. what?|Q|Bro027|0
mn052|we have the v.a.d. information also available at the back end.|S|Bro027|1
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
mn052|so if it is something the neural net is not able to discriminate the classes|D|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn052|i mean|F|Bro027|1
mn052|because most of it is|D|Bro027|1
mn052|i mean we have dropped some silence we have dropped silence frames.|S|Bro027|1
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
mn052|no we haven't dropped silence frames still.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uh still not.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|so|F|Bro027|1
mn052|the biggest classification would be the speech and silence.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|so by having an additional uh feature which says this is speech and this is nonspeech i mean it certainly helps in some unseen noise conditions for the neural net.|S|Bro027|1
me018|what|D|Bro027|0
me018|do do you have that feature available for the test data?|Q|Bro027|0
mn052|well i mean we have we are transferring the v.a.d. to the back end.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|feature to the back end.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|because we are dropping it at the back end after everything all the features are computed.|S|Bro027|1
me018|oh oh i see.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|so|F|Bro027|1
me018|i see.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|so the neural|D|Bro027|1
mn052|so that is coming from a separate neural net or some v.a.d.|S|Bro027|1
me018|okay.|S|Bro027|0
me018|okay.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|which is which is certainly giving a|D|Bro027|1
me018|so you're saying feed that also into the neural net.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|to|D|Bro027|1
mn052|so it's an additional discriminating information.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me018|right.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|so that|D|Bro027|1
me013|you could feed it into the neural net.|S|Bro027|0
me013|the other thing you could do is just um modify the uh output probabilities of the of the uh uh um neural net tandem neural net based on the fact that you have a silence probability.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|right?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me013|so you have an independent estimator of what the silence probability is.|S|Bro027|0
me013|and you could multiply the two things and renormalize.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uh i mean you'd have to do the nonlinearity part and deal with that.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me013|uh i mean go backwards from what the nonlinearity would you know would be.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|through to the soft max.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but but uh|F|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah so|F|Bro027|1
mn007|maybe yeah when|D|Bro027|1
me018|but in principle wouldn't it be better to feed it in?|Q|Bro027|0
me018|and let the net do that.|S|Bro027|0
me013|well not sure.|S|Bro027|1
me013|i mean|F|Bro027|1
me018|huh?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|let's put it this way.|S|Bro027|1
me013|i mean you you have this complicated system with thousands and thousand parameters.|S|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|and you can tell it uh learn this thing.|S|Bro027|1
me013|or you can say it's silence.|S|Bro027|1
me013|go away.|S|Bro027|1
me013|i mean|F|Bro027|1
me013|i mean|D|Bro027|1
me013|doesn't|D|Bro027|1
me013|i think i think the second one sounds a lot more direct.|S|Bro027|1
me018|what|D|Bro027|0
me018|what if you|D|Bro027|0
me013|uh|F|Bro027|1
me018|right.|S|Bro027|0
me018|so what if you then uh since you know this what if you only use the neural net on the speech portions?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|well uh|F|Bro027|1
mn007|that's what|D|Bro027|0
me018|well i guess that's the same.|S|Bro027|1
me018|uh that's similar.|S|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|i mean you'd have to actually run it continuously.|S|Bro027|0
me013|but it's.|D|Bro027|0
me018|but i mean i mean train the net only on|D|Bro027|1
me013|well no.|S|Bro027|0
me013|you want to train on on the nonspeech also.|S|Bro027|0
me013|because that's part of what you're learning in it.|S|Bro027|0
me013|to to to generate that it's it has to distinguish between.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|speech.|S|Bro027|1
me018|but i mean if you're going to if you're going to multiply the output of the net by this other decision uh would then you don't care about whether the net makes that distinction right?|S|Bro027|0
me013|well yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but this other thing isn't perfect.|S|Bro027|1
me018|uh.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so that you bring in some information from the net itself.|S|Bro027|1
me018|right.|S|Bro027|0
me018|okay.|S|Bro027|0
me018|that's a good point.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|F|Bro027|1
me013|now the only thing that that bothers me about all this is that i i i the the fact|D|Bro027|1
me013|it's sort of bothersome that you're getting more deletions.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|but|D|Bro027|0
mn007|so i might maybe look at|D|Bro027|0
mn007|is it due to the fact that um the probability of the silence at the output of the network is|D|Bro027|0
mn007|uh|F|Bro027|0
me013|is too high.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|too too high?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|or|D|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so maybe|D|Bro027|1
mn007|if it's the case then multiplying it again by by something|D|Bro027|0
me013|so|F|Bro027|1
mn052|it may not be it|D|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|it it may be too it's too high in a sense like everything is more like a um flat probability.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|so like it's not really doing any distinction between speech and nonspeech.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|uh yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn052|or i mean different among classes.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me018|be interesting to look at the|D|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|F|Bro027|1
me018|for the|D|Bro027|1
me018|i wonder if you could do this.|S|Bro027|1
me018|but if you look at the um highly high the output of the net on the high mismatch case and just look at you know the distribution versus the the other ones do you do you see more peaks or something?|Q|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah like the entropy of the the output.|S|Bro027|0
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|or|D|Bro027|0
me013|yeah for instance.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but i|F|Bro027|1
mn007|it it seems that the v.a.d. network doesn't well it doesn't drop uh too many frames.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|because the the number of deletion is reasonable.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|but it's just when we add the tandem the final m.l.p. and then|D|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|now the only problem is you don't want to i guess wait for the output of the v.a.d. before you can put something into the other system.|S|Bro027|1
me013|because that'll shoot up the latency a lot.|S|Bro027|1
me013|right?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|am i missing something here?|Q|Bro027|1
mn007|but|F|Bro027|0
mn052|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|right.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so that's maybe a problem with what i was just saying.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but|D|Bro027|1
me013|but i guess|D|Bro027|1
me018|but if you were going to put it in as a feature it means you already have it by the time you get to the tandem net.|S|Bro027|0
me018|right?|Q|Bro027|0
mn052|um|F|Bro027|1
mn052|well we we don't have it actually.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|because it's it has a high rate energy.|S|Bro027|1
me013|no.|S|Bro027|0
mn052|the v.a.d. has a|D|Bro027|1
me018|uh.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
me018|okay.|S|Bro027|0
me013|it's kind of done in|D|Bro027|1
me013|i mean some of the things are not in parallel.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but certainly it would be in parallel with the with a tandem net.|S|Bro027|1
me018|right.|B|Bro027|0
me013|in time.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so maybe if that doesn't work|D|Bro027|1
me013|um|F|Bro027|1
me013|but it would be interesting to see if that was the problem anyway.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and and and then i guess another alternative would be to take the feature that you're feeding into the v.a.d. and feeding it into the other one as well.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|and then maybe it would just learn learn it better.|S|Bro027|1
me013|um|F|Bro027|1
me013|but that's|D|Bro027|1
me013|yeah that's an interesting thing to try to see if what's going on is that in the highly mismatched condition it's um causing deletions by having this silence probability up up too high.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|at some point where the v.a.d. is saying it's actually speech.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|so|F|Bro027|0
me013|which is probably true.|S|Bro027|1
me013|because|D|Bro027|1
me013|well the v.a.|D|Bro027|1
me013|if the v.a.d. said|D|Bro027|1
me013|since the v.a.d. is is is right a lot|D|Bro027|1
me013|uh|F|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
me013|huh.|F|Bro027|1
me013|anyway.|F|Bro027|1
me013|might be.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|well we just started working with it.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but these are these are some good ideas i think.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah and the other thing|D|Bro027|0
mn007|well there are other issues maybe for the tandem.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|like uh well do we want to uh do we want to work on the targets.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|or like instead of using phonemes using more context dependent units.|S|Bro027|0
me018|for the tandem net you mean?|S|Bro027|1
mn007|well i'm|D|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me018|huh.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|i'm thinking also a about dan's work where he he trained a network not on phoneme targets but on the h.m.m. state targets.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|and|F|Bro027|0
mn007|it was giving slightly better results.|S|Bro027|0
me013|problem is if you are going to run this on different test sets including large vocabulary.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|um|F|Bro027|1
mn007|uh|F|Bro027|0
mn007|huh.|F|Bro027|0
me013|i think|D|Bro027|1
mn007|i was just thinking maybe about like generalized diphones.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|and come up with a a reasonable not too large set of context dependent units.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|and|D|Bro027|0
mn007|and|F|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro027|0
mn007|and then anyway we would have to reduce this with the k.l.t.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|so|F|Bro027|0
mn007|but|F|Bro027|0
mn007|i don't know.|F|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me013|well maybe.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|but i i it it it's all worth looking at.|S|Bro027|1
me013|but it sounds to me like uh looking at the relationship between this and the speech noise stuff is is is probably a key thing.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|that and the correlation between stuff.|S|Bro027|1
me018|so if|D|Bro027|0
me018|uh|F|Bro027|0
me018|if the uh high mismatch case had been more like the uh the other two cases in terms of giving you just a better performance how would this number have changed?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
mn007|oh it would be|D|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro027|1
mn007|around five percent better i guess.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|if if|D|Bro027|1
me018|like sixty?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|well we don't know what's it's going to be the t.i. digits yet.|S|Bro027|1
me013|he hasn't got the results back yet.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|if you extrapolate the speechdat-car well matched and medium mismatch it's around yeah maybe five.|S|Bro027|0
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
me018|so this would be sixty two?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|sixty two.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|sixty two.|S|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn052|somewhere around sixty must be.|S|Bro027|1
me018|which is|D|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro027|1
mn052|right?|Q|Bro027|0
mn052|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|well it's around five percent because it's|D|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|right?|Q|Bro027|1
mn007|if everything is five percent.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro027|1
me018|all the other ones were five percent.|S|Bro027|0
me018|the|D|Bro027|0
mn007|i i i just have the speechdat-car right now.|S|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|so|F|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|it's running.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|it we should have the results today during the afternoon.|S|Bro027|1
me018|huh.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|but|F|Bro027|1
mn007|well.|D|Bro027|1
me013|huh.|B|Bro027|0
me013|well.|F|Bro027|0
me013|um|F|Bro027|0
me013|so i won't be here for|D|Bro027|0
me018|when|D|Bro027|1
me018|when do you leave?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|uh i'm leaving next wednesday.|S|Bro027|0
me013|may or may not be in in the morning.|S|Bro027|0
me013|i leave in the afternoon.|S|Bro027|0
me013|um|F|Bro027|0
me013|so i|D|Bro027|0
me018|but you're|D|Bro027|1
me018|are you|D|Bro027|1
me018|you're not going to be around this afternoon?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me018|oh.|S|Bro027|1
me013|oh well.|S|Bro027|0
me013|i'm talking about next week.|S|Bro027|0
me013|i'm leaving leaving next wednesday.|S|Bro027|0
me018|uhhuh.|S|Bro027|1
me013|this afternoon uh|D|Bro027|0
me013|oh right.|S|Bro027|0
me013|for the meeting meeting.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah that's just because of something on campus.|S|Bro027|0
me018|uh.|S|Bro027|1
me018|okay.|S|Bro027|1
me018|okay.|S|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|D|Bro027|0
me013|but um|F|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so next week i won't.|S|Bro027|0
me013|and the week after i won't.|S|Bro027|0
me013|because i'll be in finland.|S|Bro027|0
me013|and the week after that i won't.|S|Bro027|0
me013|by that time you'll be uh you'll both be gone from here.|S|Bro027|0
me013|so there'll be no definitely no meeting on on september sixth.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uh|F|Bro027|0
me013|and|F|Bro027|0
me018|what's september sixth?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|uh that's during eurospeech.|S|Bro027|0
me018|oh oh right.|S|Bro027|1
me018|okay.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so uh sunil will be in oregon.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uh stephane and i will be in denmark.|S|Bro027|0
me013|uh|F|Bro027|0
me013|right?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|so it'll be a few weeks really before we have a meeting of the same cast of characters.|S|Bro027|0
me013|um|F|Bro027|0
me013|but uh|F|Bro027|0
me013|i guess just|D|Bro027|0
me013|i mean you guys should probably meet.|S|Bro027|0
me013|and maybe barry barry will be around.|S|Bro027|0
me013|and|D|Bro027|0
me013|and then uh uh we'll start up again with dave and dave and barry and stephane and us on the uh twentieth.|S|Bro027|0
me013|no.|S|Bro027|0
me013|thirteenth?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|about a month?|Q|Bro027|0
me018|so|F|Bro027|1
me018|uh you're going to be gone for the next three weeks or something?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|i'm gone for two and a half weeks starting starting next late next wednesday.|S|Bro027|0
me018|so that's you won't be at the next three of these meetings.|S|Bro027|1
me018|is that right?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|uh i won't.|S|Bro027|0
me013|it's probably four because of|D|Bro027|0
me013|is it three?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|let's see.|S|Bro027|0
me013|twenty third.|S|Bro027|0
me013|thirtieth.|S|Bro027|0
me013|sixth.|S|Bro027|0
me013|that's right.|S|Bro027|0
me013|next three.|S|Bro027|0
me013|and the the third one won't probably won't be a meeting.|S|Bro027|0
me013|because because uh sunil stephane and i will all not be here.|S|Bro027|0
me018|oh right.|S|Bro027|1
me018|right.|S|Bro027|1
me013|um|F|Bro027|0
me013|huh so it's just uh the next two where there will be there you know may as well be meetings.|S|Bro027|0
me013|but i just won't be at them.|S|Bro027|0
me018|okay.|S|Bro027|1
me013|and then starting up on the thirteenth uh we'll have meetings again.|S|Bro027|0
me013|but we'll have to do without sunil here somehow.|S|Bro027|0
me018|when do you go back?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|so|F|Bro027|0
mn052|thirty first august.|S|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yeah.|F|Bro027|0
me013|so|F|Bro027|0
me013|cool.|S|Bro027|0
me018|when is the evaluation?|Q|Bro027|1
me018|november?|Q|Bro027|1
me018|or something?|Q|Bro027|1
me013|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|it was supposed to be november fifteenth.|S|Bro027|0
me013|has anybody heard anything different?|Q|Bro027|0
mn007|i don't know.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|the meeting in is the five and six of december.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|it's like yeah it's tentatively all full.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|so|F|Bro027|1
mn052|yeah.|B|Bro027|0
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro027|1
mn052|uh that's a proposed date i guess.|S|Bro027|0
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|um|F|Bro027|1
mn007|so the evaluation should be on a week before.|S|Bro027|1
mn007|or|D|Bro027|1
me018|yeah.|S|Bro027|0
me013|yep.|F|Bro027|1
me013|but no this is good progress.|S|Bro027|1
me013|so|F|Bro027|1
me013|uh|F|Bro027|1
me013|okay.|S|Bro027|1
me013|guess we're done.|S|Bro027|1
me018|should we do digits?|Q|Bro027|0
me013|digits.|S|Bro027|1
me013|yep.|S|Bro027|1
