mn015|um apart from that sort of the old gang johno and bhaskara have been with us from from day one.|S|Bed006|0
me045|hi.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and um they're engaged in in various activities some of which you will hear about today.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|ami is um our counselor and spiritual guidance.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and um also interested in problems concerning reference of the more complex type.|S|Bed006|0
me045|oh wow.|S|Bed006|1
mn036|well|D|Bed006|0
mn015|and um he sits in as a interested participant and helper.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|is that a good characterization?|Q|Bed006|1
mn036|that's pretty good i think.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|i don't know.|S|Bed006|1
mn036|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|thanks.|S|Bed006|0

me045|yes.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and um hopefully it is by by means of keith that we will be able to get a a better formal and a better semantic um idea of what a construction is.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and um how we can make it work for us.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|additionally his interest um surpasses um english.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|because it also entails german.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|an extra capability of speaking and writing and understanding and reading that language.|S|Bed006|1

mn015|officially.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|but in reality already um much much longer.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and um um next to some some more or less bureaucratic uh stuff with the the data collection she's also the wizard in the data collection.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|of oz.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|um|F|Bed006|0
fe046|it's very exciting.|S|Bed006|1

fe046|yes.|S|Bed006|1
fe046|yes.|D|Bed006|1
mn015|okay.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|and um|F|Bed006|0

me003|wizardette.|S|Bed006|0
me045|wizard.|S|Bed006|1
me012|wizardess.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|sorceress i think.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|0
fe046|wizard.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|wizard.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|uh by by popular vote.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|um|F|Bed006|0
fe004|didn't take a vote.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|okay um why don't we get started on that subject anyways?|Q|Bed006|0
mn015|um so we're about to collect data.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and um the uh the following things have happened since we last met.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|when will we three meet again?|Q|Bed006|0
mn015|and um|F|Bed006|0
fe004|more than three of us.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|what happened is that um a there was some confusion between you and jerry with the that leading to your talking to catherine snow.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and he was uh he he agreed completely that something confusing happened.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|um his idea was to get sort of the the lists of mayors of the department.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|the students.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|it it's exactly how you interpreted it.|S|Bed006|0
me045|the list of majors in the department?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|sort of|D|Bed006|0
fe046|majors?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|majors majors.|S|Bed006|0
fe046|majors?|Q|Bed006|1
fe046|okay mayor.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|mayors.|S|Bed006|0
fe046|something i don't know about these.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|majors.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|the department has many mayors.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|majors.|S|Bed006|0
fe046|okay.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and um just sending the the little write up that we did on to those email lists.|S|Bed006|0
fe046|okay.|S|Bed006|1
fe046|yeah yeah yeah.|S|Bed006|1
fe046|but|D|Bed006|1
fe046|yeah.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|uh|F|Bed006|0
fe046|so it was really carol snow who was confused not me and not jerry.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yep yep yep.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|okay.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|so|F|Bed006|0
fe046|that's good.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|so that is uh|D|Bed006|0
fe046|so i should still do that?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|yep.|S|Bed006|0
fe046|okay.|S|Bed006|1
fe046|and using the thing that you wrote up.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and|D|Bed006|0
mn015|yep.|S|Bed006|0
fe046|okay.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|wonderful.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and um we have a little description of asking subjects to contact fey for you know recruiting them for our thing.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and um there was some confusion as to the consent form which is basically that that what what you just signed.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|right.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|and since we have one already um|D|Bed006|0
fe004|did jerry talk to you about maybe using our class?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|the students in the undergrad class that he's teaching?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|um well he said um we definitely yes.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|however there is always more people in a in a uh in a department than are just taking his class or anybody else's class at the moment.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|and one should sort of reach out and try and get them all.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|okay but i guess it's that um people in his class cover a different set.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|so|F|Bed006|1
fe004|than the|D|Bed006|1
fe004|is the cogsci department that you were talking about?|Q|Bed006|1
fe046|i guess.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uh reaching out to.|S|Bed006|1
fe046|see|D|Bed006|0
fe004|because we have you know people from other areas.|S|Bed006|1
fe046|that's what i suggested to him that people like like jerry and george and et cetera just|D|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|advertise in their classes as well.|S|Bed006|0
fe046|yeah.|S|Bed006|1
fe046|or even i could you know i could do the actual|D|Bed006|1
fe004|because i mean i i know how to contact our students.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
fe046|that's generally the way it's done.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|so if there's something that you're sending out you can also um send me a copy.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|me or bhaskara could either of us could post it to|D|Bed006|1
fe004|uh|F|Bed006|1
fe004|is it|D|Bed006|1
fe004|if it's a general solicitation that you know is just contact you then we can totally post it to the news group.|S|Bed006|1
fe046|a mailing list.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
fe046|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|so|F|Bed006|0
mn015|do it.|S|Bed006|1
fe046|that's|D|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|so you'll send it?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|or something?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|so|F|Bed006|0
mn015|as a matter of fact if you|D|Bed006|1
fe046|i can send it.|S|Bed006|0
fe046|i'll send it.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|you can send it to me.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|if|D|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|1
fe046|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|now|D|Bed006|1
fe004|don't worry.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|we this doesn't concern you anymore robert.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|it's fine.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|how however i suggest that if you if you look at your email carefully you may think you may find that you already have it.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|oops!|S|Bed006|0
fe004|already?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|really?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|oops!|S|Bed006|0
mn015|maybe.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|okay.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|i don't remember getting anything.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|we'll see.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|anyhow.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|um the uh|F|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah not only cogsci.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|also we will talk about linguistics and of course computer science.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|um and then secondly we had you may remember um the problem with the re phrasing.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|that subject always rephrase sort of the task that uh we gave them.|S|Bed006|1
me003|right.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|and so we had a meeting on friday talking about how to avoid that.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and it proved finally fruitful in the sense that we came up with a new scenario for how to get the the subject to really have intentions.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and sort of to act upon those.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and um|F|Bed006|1
mn015|there the idea is now that next actually we we need to hire one more person to actually do that job.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|because it it's getting more complicated.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|so if you know anyone interested in in what i'm about to describe tell that person to to write a mail to me or jerry soon.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|fast.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|um the idea now is to sort of come up with a high level of sort of abstract tasks.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|go shopping.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|um take in uh a batch of art.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|um|F|Bed006|1
mn015|visit|D|Bed006|1
mn015|do some sightseeing.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|blah blah blah blah blah.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|sort of analogous to what fey has started in in in compiling compiling here.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and already she has already gone to the trouble of of anchoring it with specific um um entities and real world places you will find in heidelberg.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and um|F|Bed006|1
mn015|so out of these these high level categories the subject can pick a couple.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|such as if if there is a uh a category in emptying your roll of film the person can then decide okay i want to do that at this place.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|sort of make up their own itinerary and and tasks.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and the person is not allowed to take sort of this high level category list with them.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|but uh|F|Bed006|1
mn015|the person is able to take notes on a map that we will give him and the map will be a tourist's sort of schematic representation with with symbols for the objects.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and so the person can maybe make a mental note that uh yeah i wanted to go shopping here.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and i wanted to maybe take a picture of that.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and maybe um eat here.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and then goes in and solves the task with the system.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|i e fey.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and um|F|Bed006|1
mn015|and we're going to try out that.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|any questions?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|so um you'll have those say somewhere what their intention was?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|so you still have the the nice thing about having data where you know what the actual intention was.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|uhhuh yeah.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|but they will um|D|Bed006|0
fe004|there's nothing that says you know these are the things you want to do .|S|Bed006|0
fe004|so they'll say well these are the things i want to do.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|and|F|Bed006|0
fe004|right.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|so they'll have a little bit more natural interaction.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|hopefully.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
me012|so they'll be given this map which means that they won't have to like ask the system for for like high level information about where things are?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah it's a schematic tourist map.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|so it'll be uh it'll still require the that information.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and|D|Bed006|0
fe004|it it doesn't have like streets on it that would allow them to figure out their way|D|Bed006|1
mn015|not not not really the street network.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|nuh.|B|Bed006|0
me045|so you're just saying like what part of town the things are in or whatever?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah|D|Bed006|0
mn015|and um|F|Bed006|0
mn015|the map is more a means for them to have the buildings and their names.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and maybe some major streets and their names.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|and we want to maybe ask them if you have get it sort of isolated street.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|the the whatever.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|river street.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and they know that they have decided that yes that's where they want to do this kind of action um that they have it with them and they can actually read them.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|or sort of have the label for the object.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|because it's too hard to memorize all these strange german names.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and then we're going to have another we're going to have another trial run.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|i e the first with that new setup tomorrow at two.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and we have a real interesting subject which is ron kay.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|for who those who know him he's the founder of i c i.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|so he'll he's around seventy years old or something.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|i didn't know he was the founder.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|that's|D|Bed006|1
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and he also approached me and he offered to help um our project.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and he was more thinking about some high level thinking tasks.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and i said sure we need help.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|you can come in as a subject.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and he said okay.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|so that's what's going to happen tomorrow.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|using this new new um plan.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|data.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|new new set up.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|which i'll hopefully sort of scrape together|D|Bed006|0
mn015|but thanks to fey we already have sort of a nice blueprint and i can work with that.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|questions?|Q|Bed006|0
mn015|comments on that?|Q|Bed006|0
mn015|if not we can move on.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|no?|Q|Bed006|0
mn015|no more questions?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|so what's the this is what you made fey?|Q|Bed006|1
me045|i'm not sure i totally understand this.|S|Bed006|0
me045|but|D|Bed006|0
mn015|huh?|Q|Bed006|1
me045|i'm not sure i totally understand everything that's being talked about.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|like so so it's just based on like the materials you had about heidelberg?|Q|Bed006|1
me045|but i i imagine i'll just catch on.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|um are you familiar with with the with the very rough setup of the data?|Q|Bed006|1
fe046|based on the web site.|S|Bed006|0
fe046|yeah at the|D|Bed006|0
fe004|oh okay.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|there's a web site.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|and then you could like um figure out what the|D|Bed006|1
mn015|experiment.|S|Bed006|0
fe046|right.|B|Bed006|1
me045|uh this is where they're supposed to|D|Bed006|0
fe046|it's a tourist information web site.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|0
fe046|so|F|Bed006|1
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|talk to a machine and it breaks down and then the human comes on.|S|Bed006|1
me045|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
me045|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|the question is just sort of how do we get the tasks in their head that they have an intention of doing something and have a need to ask the system for something without giving them sort of a clear wording or phrasing of the task.|S|Bed006|1
me045|okay.|B|Bed006|0
me045|okay.|B|Bed006|0
me045|okay.|B|Bed006|0
me045|okay.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|because what will happen then is that people repeat repeat or as much as they can of that phrasing.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|huh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|um are you worried about being able to identify|D|Bed006|0
me045|okay.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|um|F|Bed006|0
fe004|the the goals that we've you guys have been talking about are this these you know identifying which of three modes um their question uh concerns.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|so it's like the enter versus view|D|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah we we we will sort of get a protocol of the prior interaction.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|right?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|that's where the instructor the person we are going to hire um and the subjects sit down together with these high level things.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|and so|D|Bed006|1
mn015|the first question for the subject is so these are things you know we thought a tourist can do.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|is there anything that interests you?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|and the person can say yeah sure|D|Bed006|1
mn015|this is something i would do.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|i would go shopping.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|and then we can sort of this instructor can say well uh then you you may want to find out how to get over here.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|because this is where the shopping district is.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|so the interaction beforehand will give them hints about how specific or how whatever though the kinds of questions that are going to ask during the actual session?|Q|Bed006|0
mn015|no.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|just sort of okay what what what would you like to buy.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and then um okay there you want to buy a whatever cuckoos clocks.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|okay and there is a store there.|S|Bed006|1
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|so the task then for that person is finding out how to get there.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|right?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|that's sort of what's left.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|and we know that the intention is to enter because we know that the person wants to buy a cuckoos clock.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|okay that's what i mean.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|so like those tasks are all going to be um unambiguous about which of the three modes.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|hopefully.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|right okay.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|so|F|Bed006|0
mn036|well so the idea is to try to get the actual phrasing that they might use and try to interfere as little as possible with their choice of words.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|hopefully.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|that they'll be here?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|yes in a sense that's exactly the the the idea.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|uh uh|F|Bed006|1
mn015|which is never possible in a in a in a lab situation.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|well the one experiment that that that i've read somewhere it was they used pictures.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|nuh?|Q|Bed006|0
mn015|yep.|S|Bed006|0
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
mn036|so to to uh actually um uh specify the the tasks.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|uh but you know|D|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|we had exactly that on our list of possible things.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|so we uh i even made a sort of a silly thing how that could work how you control you are here.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|you you want to know how to get someplace.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and this is the place.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and it's a museum.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and you want to do|D|Bed006|1
mn015|and and and there's a person looking at pictures.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|so you know this is exactly getting someplace with the intention of entering and looking at pictures.|S|Bed006|1
mn036|right.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|however not only was the common census were among all participants of friday's meeting was it's going to be very laborious to to make these drawings for each different things.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|all the different actions if at all possible.|S|Bed006|1
mn036|right.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|and also people will get caught up in the pictures.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|so all of a sudden we'll get descriptions of pictures in there.|S|Bed006|1
mn036|right.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|and people talking about pictures and pictorial representations.|S|Bed006|1
me045|huh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|and um|F|Bed006|1
mn036|right.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|i would i would still be willing to try it.|S|Bed006|1
mn036|i mean i'm i'm not saying it's necessary.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|but but uh uh uh you might be able to combine you know text uh and and some sort of picture.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|and also uh i think it it will be a good idea to show them the text and kind of chew the task.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|and then take the test away the the the the the text away.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn036|so that they are not uh guided by by by what you wrote.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|we will|D|Bed006|1
mn036|but can come up with their with their own|D|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|they will have no more linguistic matter in front of them when they enter this room.|S|Bed006|1
mn036|right.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|okay.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|then i suggest we move on to the to|D|Bed006|1
mn015|we have um uh the e d u project.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|let me make one more general remark has sort of two two side uh um actions its um action items that we're dealing with.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|one is modifying the smartkom parser and the other one is modifying the smartkom natural language generation module.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and um this is not too complicated.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|but i'm just mentioning it.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|put it in the framework.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|because this is something we will talk about now.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|um i have some news from the generation.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|do you have news from the parser?|Q|Bed006|1
me012|um not|D|Bed006|0
mn015|by that look i|D|Bed006|1
me012|yes uh i would really it would be better if i talked about it on friday.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|okay.|S|Bed006|1
me012|if that's okay.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|wonderful.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|um did you run into problems or did you run into not having time?|Q|Bed006|1
me012|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
me012|but not not any time part.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|okay so that's good.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|that's better than running into problems.|S|Bed006|1
me012|okay.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|and um i i do have some good news for the natural language generation however.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and the good news is i guess it's done.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|uh meaning that tilman becker who does the german one actually took out some time and already did it in english for us.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and so the version he's sending us is already producing the english that's needed to get by in version one point one.|S|Bed006|1
me012|so i take it that was similar to the what what we did for the parsing.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|i i it even though the generator is a little bit more complex.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and it would have been not changing one hundred words but maybe four hundred words.|S|Bed006|1
me012|okay.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|but it would have been.|D|Bed006|1
me012|okay.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|but this this is i guess good news.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and the uh the time|D|Bed006|1
mn015|and especially bhaskara|D|Bed006|1
mn015|and uh and um|F|Bed006|1
mn015|oh do i have it here?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|no.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|the time is now pretty much fixed.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|it's the last week of april until the fourth of may.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|so it's twenty sixth through fourth that they'll be here.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|so it's it's extremely important that the two of you are also present in this town during that time.|S|Bed006|1
me003|wait what what are the days?|Q|Bed006|0
me003|april twenty sixth to the may fourth?|Q|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah something like that.|S|Bed006|1
me003|i'll probably be here.|S|Bed006|0
me012|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|it's|D|Bed006|0
me045|you will be here.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|there is a|D|Bed006|0
mn015|isn't finals coming up then pretty much after that?|Q|Bed006|0
me012|finals was that.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah it doesn't really have much meaning to grad students.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|but final projects might.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|okay.|S|Bed006|1
me012|yeah actually that's true.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|that|D|Bed006|1
mn015|anyway so this is|D|Bed006|0
me003|well i'll be here working on something.|S|Bed006|1
me003|guaranteed.|S|Bed006|1
me003|it's just uh will i be here you know in|D|Bed006|1
me003|uh|F|Bed006|1
me003|i'll be here too actually.|S|Bed006|1
me003|but|D|Bed006|1
mn036|huh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|no it's just um you know they're coming for us so that we can bug them.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and ask them more questions.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and sit down together.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and write sensible code.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and they can give some nice talks and stuff.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|but uh|F|Bed006|1
mn015|just make a|D|Bed006|1
me003|but it's not like we need to be with them twenty four hours a day for the seven days that they're here.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|not not unless you really really want to.|S|Bed006|1
me045|they're very dependent.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|not unless you really want to.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and they're both nice guys.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|so you may may want to.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|okay that much from the parser and generator side.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|unless there are more questions on that.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|so no sample generator output yet?|Q|Bed006|0
mn015|no.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|it just a mail that you know he's sending me the the the stuff soon.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|this is being sent.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|and i was completely flabbergasted here.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and i and that's also it's it's going to produce the concept to speech uh blah blah blah information for necessary for one point one in english.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|based on the english.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|you know in english.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|so|F|Bed006|1
mn015|i was like okay.|S|Bed006|1
me045|we're done.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|we're done!|S|Bed006|1
fe004|so that was like one of the first you know the first task was getting it working for english.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|so that's basically over now.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|is that right?|Q|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|so the basic requirement fulfilled.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|um the basic requirement is fulfilled almost.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|when andreas stolcke and and his gang|D|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|when they have um changed the language model of the recognizer and the dictionary then we can actually put it all together.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|so the speech recognizer also works.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|and|F|Bed006|1
mn015|you can speak into it and ask for t v and movie information.|S|Bed006|1
me045|toll.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and then when|D|Bed006|1
mn015|if if something actually happens and some answers come out then we're done.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|if and they're kind of correct.|S|Bed006|0
me045|so it's not done basically.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|huh?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|and they kind of are are correct.|S|Bed006|1
me045|right.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|it's not just like anything.|S|Bed006|1
me045|perhaps if the answers have something to do with the questions for example.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|and they're mostly in english.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|so|D|Bed006|1
mn015|then um|F|Bed006|0
fe004|are they is it using the database?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|the german t v movie.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|so all the actual data might be german names.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|um well actually um|F|Bed006|0
fe004|or are they all like american t v programs?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|um well|D|Bed006|0
me045|i want to see die dukes von hazard.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|the|D|Bed006|0
mn015|okay so you don't know how the german dialogue uh the german the demo dialogue actually works.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|it works|D|Bed006|0
mn015|the first thing is what's you know showing on t v.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and then the person is presented with what's running on t v.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|in germany on that day on that evening.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|and so you take one look at it and then you say well that's really nothing there's nothing for me there.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|what's running in the cinemas?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|so maybe there's something better happening there.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and then you get you're shown what movies play which films.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and it's going to be of course all the heidelberg movies and what films they are actually showing.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|and most of them are going to be hollywood movies.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|huh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|so american beauty is american beauty.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|right?|Q|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|F|Bed006|0
fe004|right.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and um|F|Bed006|0
fe004|but they're shown like on a screen.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|it's a i mean so would the generator|D|Bed006|1
fe004|like the english language sentence of it is these are the you know the following films are being shown or something like that.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah but it in that sense it doesn't make in that case uh it doesn't really make sense to read them out loud.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|right.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|so it'll just display|D|Bed006|1
mn015|if you're displaying them.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|so we don't have to worry about um|D|Bed006|1
mn015|but uh it'll tell you that this is what's showing in heidelberg and there you go.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|and the presentation agent will go nuh.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|like that the avatar.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|and um|F|Bed006|0
mn015|and then you pick pick a movie and and and it shows you the times.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and you pick a time.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and you pick seats and all of this.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|so|F|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|pretty straightforward.|S|Bed006|0
me045|okay.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|but it's so this time we we are at an advantage.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|because it was a problem for the german system to incorporate all these english movie titles.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|nuh?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|right.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|but in english that's not really a problem.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|unless we get some some topical german movies that have just come out and that are in their database.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|right.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|so the person may select huehner rennen or whatever.|S|Bed006|0
me045|chicken run.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|okay.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|then uh on to the modeling.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|right?|Q|Bed006|0
me003|yeah yeah i guess.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|um then modeling.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|there it is.|S|Bed006|0
me045|okay what's the next thing?|Q|Bed006|1
me003|yep.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|this is very rough but this is sort of what um johno and i managed to come up with.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|the idea here is that|D|Bed006|1
me003|this is the uh the schema of the x m l here.|S|Bed006|0
me003|not an example or something like that.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah this is not an x m l.|S|Bed006|1
me045|okay.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|this is sort of towards an a schema.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|nuh?|Q|Bed006|1
mn036|right.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|definition.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|the idea is so imagine we have a library of schema.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|such as the source path goal.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and then we have forced uh motion.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|we have cost action.|S|Bed006|1
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|we have a whole library of schemas.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and they're going to be you know fleshed out in in their real ugly detail.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|source path goal.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and there's going to be a lot of stuff on the goal and blah blah blah that a goal can be and so forth.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|what we think is|D|Bed006|0
mn015|and all the names could should be taken cum grano salis.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|so|F|Bed006|0
mn015|this is a|D|Bed006|0
mn015|the fact that we're calling this action schema right now should not entail that we are going to continue calling this action schema.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|but what that means is we have here first of all|D|Bed006|0
mn015|on the in the in the first iteration a stupid list of source path goal actions.|S|Bed006|0
me003|actions that can be categorized with|D|Bed006|1
me003|or that are related to source path goal.|S|Bed006|1
me045|okay.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|to that schema.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|and we will have you know forced motion and cost action actions.|S|Bed006|1
me003|and then those actions can be in multiple categories at the same time if necessary.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|so a push may be in in in both you know push uh in this or this.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|forced motion and caused action for instance.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|uh|F|Bed006|1
mn015|exactly.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|also these things may or may not get their own structure in the future.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|so this is something that you know may also be a as a result of your work.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|in the future we may find out that you know there're really these subtle differences between|D|Bed006|1
mn015|um|F|Bed006|1
mn015|even within the domain of entering in the light of a source path goal schema that we need to put in fill in additional structure up there.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|but it gives us a nice handle.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|so with this we can basically um you know slaughter the cow anyway we want.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|uh|F|Bed006|1
mn015|it it is it was sort of a it gave us some headache.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|how do we avoid writing down that we have sort of the enter source path goal?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|that this but this sort of gets the job done in that respect.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and maybe it is even conceptually somewhat adequate in a sense that um we're talking about two different things.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|we're talking more on the sort of intention level up there.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and more on the this is the your basic bone um schema down there.|S|Bed006|1
me003|uh one question robert.|S|Bed006|0
me003|when you point at the screen is it your shadow that i'm supposed to look at?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|yeah it's the shadow.|S|Bed006|1
me003|okay.|S|Bed006|0
me003|whereas i keep looking where your hand is.|S|Bed006|0
me003|and it doesn't|D|Bed006|0
mn015|well that wouldn't have helped you at all.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|right.|D|Bed006|0
me003|yeah.|S|Bed006|1
me003|basically what this is is that there's an interface between what we are doing and the action planner.|S|Bed006|1
me045|spit right here.|S|Bed006|0
me003|and right now the way the interface is action go and then they have the what the person claimed was the source and the person claimed as the goal passed on.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
me003|and the problem is is that the current system does not distinguish between goes of type going into goes of type want to go to a place where i can take a picture of et cetera.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|so this is sort of what it looks like|D|Bed006|0
mn015|now some simple go action from it from an object named peter's kirche of the type church to an object named powder tower of the type tower.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|this is the uh what the action planner uses?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|right?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|this is|D|Bed006|1
me003|right currently.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|currently.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|and is that and that's changeable?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|or not?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah well|D|Bed006|0
fe004|like are we adapting to it?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|or|D|Bed006|1
mn015|no.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|we this is the output sort of of the natural language understanding.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|oh yeah.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|right?|Q|Bed006|0
mn015|the input into the action planning as it is now.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|and what we are going to do|D|Bed006|0
mn015|we going to|D|Bed006|0
mn015|and you can see here|D|Bed006|0
mn015|and again for johno please please focus the shadow.|S|Bed006|0
me003|okay.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|um we're|D|Bed006|0
mn015|uh uh|F|Bed006|0
mn015|here you have the action and the domain object.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and and on on|D|Bed006|0
fe004|what did you think he was doing?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|okay sorry!|S|Bed006|1
me003|i just|D|Bed006|0
me045|a laser pointer would be most appropriate here i think.|S|Bed006|1
fe046|eee|D|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah i i um have i have no|D|Bed006|1
me003|robert likes to be abstract.|S|Bed006|0
me003|and that's what i just thought he was doing.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|you look up here.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|sort of between here and here.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|so as you can see this is on one level and we are going to add another um struct if you want i e a rich action description on that level.|S|Bed006|0
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|so in the future|D|Bed006|0
fe004|so it's just an additional information|D|Bed006|1
mn015|exactly.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|in the future though the content of a hypothesis will not only be an object and an an action and a domain object but an action a domain object and a rich action description.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|right.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|that doesn't hurt the current way.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|which is|D|Bed006|0
me003|which which we're abbreviating as rad.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|good.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|huh.|B|Bed006|0
me045|rad!|S|Bed006|1
me012|so um you had like an action schema and a source path goal schema.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|huh.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|huh.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
me012|right?|Q|Bed006|0
me012|so how does this source path goal schema fit into the uh action schema?|Q|Bed006|0
me012|like is it one of the tags there?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|yeah can you go back to that one?|S|Bed006|1
me003|so the source path goal schema in this case|D|Bed006|0
me003|i've if i understand how we described we set this up|D|Bed006|0
me003|um|F|Bed006|0
me003|because we've been arguing about it all week.|S|Bed006|0
me003|but uh we'll hold the the|D|Bed006|0
me003|well in this case it will hold the i mean the the features i guess.|S|Bed006|0
me003|i'm not it's hard for me to exactly|D|Bed006|0
me003|so basically that will store the the object that is|D|Bed006|0
me003|the source will store the object that we're going from.|S|Bed006|0
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
me003|the goal will store the the|D|Bed006|0
fe004|so the fillers of the role source.|S|Bed006|1
me003|we'll fill those in fill those roles in.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|1
me003|right?|Q|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed006|1
me003|the action schemas basically have extra|D|Bed006|0
me003|see we so those are schemas exist|D|Bed006|0
me003|because in case we need extra information|D|Bed006|0
me003|instead of just making it an attribute and which which is just one thing we we decided to make it's own entity so that we could explode it out later on in case there is some structure that that we need to exploit.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|okay so|D|Bed006|1
fe004|sorry i just don't|D|Bed006|1
fe004|um um um|F|Bed006|1
fe004|this is just uh x m l notational.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|but um the fact that it's action schema and then sort of slash action schema.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|that's a whole|D|Bed006|1
me003|that's a block.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|that's a block.|S|Bed006|1
me003|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|whereas source is just an attribute?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|is that|D|Bed006|1
mn015|no no no.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|source is just not spelled out here.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|oh okay okay.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|source meaning source will be uh will have a name a type maybe a dimensionality.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|maybe canonical uh orientation|D|Bed006|0
fe004|okay could it it could also be blocked out then as|D|Bed006|1
me003|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
me003|the so|D|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|B|Bed006|1
me003|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|source it will be|D|Bed006|1
mn015|you know we'll|D|Bed006|1
mn015|we know a lot about sources.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|so we'll put all of that in source.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|but it's independent whether we are using the s p g schema in an enter view or approach mode.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|right?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|this is just properties of the s p g schema.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|we can talk about paths being the fastest the quickest the nicest and so forth.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|uh or or and the trajector should be coming in there as well.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and then the same about goals.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|so i guess the question is when you actually fill one of these out it'll be under action schema?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|those are|D|Bed006|0
fe004|it's going to be one you'll pick one of those for|D|Bed006|0
me003|right.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|okay these are this is just a layout of the possible that could go play that role.|S|Bed006|0
me003|right so the the the roles will be filled in with the schema.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|huh?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|okay go it.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
me003|and then what actual action is chosen is will be in the in the action schema section.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|okay.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|okay so one question.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|this was in this case it's all um clear sort of obvious.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|but you can think of the enter view and approach as each having their roles.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|right?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|the i mean it's it's implicit that the person that's moving is doing entering viewing and approaching.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|but you know the usual thing is we have bindings between sort of|D|Bed006|1
fe004|they're sort of like action specific roles and the more general source path goal specific roles.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|so are we worrying about that or not for now?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|yes yes.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|since you bring it up now we will worry about it.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|tell us more about it.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|what do you what do you|D|Bed006|0
fe004|what's that?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|oh i guess it|D|Bed006|1
fe004|i i may be just um reading this and interpreting it into my head in the way that i've always viewed things.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|huh.|B|Bed006|0
me045|huh.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|and that that may or may not be what you guys intended.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|but if it is then the top block is sort of like|D|Bed006|0
fe004|um you know you have to list exactly what x schema|D|Bed006|0
fe004|or in this action schema|D|Bed006|0
fe004|there'll be a certain one that has its own structure.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|and maybe it has stuff about that specific to entering or viewing or approaching.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|but those could include roles like the thing that you're viewing the thing that you're entering the thing that you're|D|Bed006|0
fe004|whatever.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|you know that which are|D|Bed006|0
me045|so very specific role names are viewed thing entered thing.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|think think of enter view and approach as frames.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|and they have frame specific parameters and and roles.|S|Bed006|0
me045|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|and you can also describe them in a general way as source path goal schema.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|and maybe there's other image schemas that you could you know add after this that you know how do they work in terms of you know a force dynamics?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|or how do they work in terms of other things?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|so all of those have um basically either specific frame specific roles or more general frame specific roles that might have binding.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|so the question is are um how to represent when things are linked in a certain way?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|so we know for enter that there's container potentially involved.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|and it's not|D|Bed006|1
fe004|uh i don't know if you want to have in the same level as the action schema s p g schema.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|it it's somewhere in there that you need to represent that there is some container.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|and the interior of it corresponds to some part of the source path goal um you know goal uh goal i guess in this case.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|so uh is there an easy way in this notation to show when there's identity basically between things?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|and i don't know if that's something we need to invent.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|or you know just|D|Bed006|1
me003|the|D|Bed006|0
me003|wasn't there supposed to be a link in the|D|Bed006|0
me012|right.|B|Bed006|1
me003|i don't know if this answers your question.|S|Bed006|0
me003|i was just staring at this while you were talking.|S|Bed006|0
me003|sorry.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|it's okay.|S|Bed006|1
me003|uh a link between the action schema a field in the in the schema for the image schemas that would link us to which action schema we were supposed to use.|S|Bed006|0
me003|so we could|D|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|um well that's that's one one thing is that we can link up.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|think also that um we can have one or as many as we want links from from the schema up to the action um description of it.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|huh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|but the notion i got from nancy's idea was that we may find sort of concepts floating around in the action description of the action enter frame up there that are when you talk about the real world actually identical to the goal of the the source path goal schema.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|exactly.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|right right.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|and do we have means of of telling it within that.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|right.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|and the answer is absolutely.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|the way we absolutely have those means that are even part of the m three l a a p i.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|oh great.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|meaning we can reference.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|so meaning|D|Bed006|1
fe004|great.|F|Bed006|0
fe004|that's exactly what is necessary.|S|Bed006|0
me003|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|and um|F|Bed006|0
mn015|this referencing thing however is of temporary nature.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|because sooner or later the w three c will be finished with their x path uh um specification.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and then it's going to be even much nicer.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|then we have real means of pointing at an individual instantiation of one of our elements here.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|and link it to another one and this not only within a document but also via documents.|S|Bed006|0
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|okay.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|and and all in a very easy homogenous framework.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|so you know happen to know how what what sooner or later means like in practice?|Q|Bed006|0
mn015|that's.|D|Bed006|1
fe004|or estimated.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|but it's soon.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|okay okay.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|so it's it's the spec is there.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and it's going to part of the m three l a p a p i filed by the end of this year.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|so that this means we can start using it basically now.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|but this is a technical detail.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|so a pointer a way to really say pointers.|S|Bed006|0
me003|basically references from the roles in the schema the bottom schemas to the action schemas is uh i'm assuming.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|okay yeah.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|okay.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|i mean personally i'm looking even more forward to the day when we're going to have x forms which is a form of notation where it allows you to say that if the s p g action up there is enter then the goal type can never be a statue.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|right.|B|Bed006|0
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|so you have constraints that are dependent on the actual specific filler uh of some attribute.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|uhhuh yeah.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah exactly.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|um you know this of course does not make sense in light of the statue of liberty.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
me045|right.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|however it is uh you know sort of these sort of things are imaginable.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|tsk|D|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|or the gateway arch in st.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah?|Q|Bed006|0
me012|so um like are you going to have similar schemas for f m?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|louis.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|so|F|Bed006|0
me012|like forced motion and caused action and stuff.|S|Bed006|1
me012|like you have for s p g.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
me012|and if so like can are you able to enforce that you know if if it's if it's s p g action then you have that schema.|S|Bed006|1
me012|if it's a forced motion then you have the other schema present in the|D|Bed006|1
mn015|um we have absolute|D|Bed006|0
mn015|no.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|we have absolutely no means of enforcing that.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|so it would be considered valid if we have an s p g action enter and no s p g schema but a forced action schema.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|could happen.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|which is not bad.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|because i mean that there's multiple|D|Bed006|1
fe004|i mean that particular case there's there there's a forced side of of that verb as well.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|huh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|it maybe it means we had nothing to say about the source path goal.|S|Bed006|0
me012|okay.|D|Bed006|1
mn015|what's also nice and for for me in my mind.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|it's it's crucially necessary is that we can have multiple schemas and multiple action schemas in parallel.|S|Bed006|0
me012|right.|D|Bed006|1
mn015|and um we started thinking about going through our bakery questions.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|so when i say is there a bakery here.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|you know i do ultimately want our module to be able to first of all tell the rest of the system hey this person actually wants to go there.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and b that person actually wants to buy something to eat there.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|nuh?|Q|Bed006|0
mn015|and if these are two different schemas|D|Bed006|0
mn015|i e the source path goal schema of getting there and then the buying snacks schema|D|Bed006|0
mn015|nuh?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|would they both be listed here in|D|Bed006|1
mn015|yes.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|under so under action schema there's a list that can include both both things.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah they they would both schemas would appear.|S|Bed006|0
me003|right.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|so what is the|D|Bed006|0
me045|snack action.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|uh is is there a buying snacks schema?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|that's interesting.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|what is the uh have|D|Bed006|0
fe004|what?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|the buying snack schema.|S|Bed006|0
me045|see.|S|Bed006|1
fe046|buying buying his food|D|Bed006|0
me045|i'm sure there's a commercial event schema in there somewhere.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|oop.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|a commercial event or something.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah i i|D|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|so uh so we would we would instantiate the s p g schema with a source path goal blah blah blah.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|i see.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and the buying event you know at which however that looks like the place thing to buy.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|interesting.|F|Bed006|0
fe004|would you say that the like|D|Bed006|0
fe004|i mean you could have a flat structure and just say these are two independent things.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|but there's also this sort of like causal.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|well so one is really facilitating the other and it's part of a compound action of some kind which has structure.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|now it's technically possible that you can fit schema within schema.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uh i i think that's nicer for a lot of reasons.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and schema within schemata|D|Bed006|1
fe004|but might be a pain.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|so uh|F|Bed006|0
mn015|um|F|Bed006|1
mn015|well for me it seems that uh|D|Bed006|1
fe004|i mean there are truly times when you have two totally independent goals that they might express at once.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|yes.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|but in this case it's really like there's a means that you know for achieving some other purpose.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|well if i'm if i'm recipient of such a message.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and i get a source path goal where the goal is a bakery.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and then i get a commercial action which takes place in a bakery.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|right?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|and and and they they are obviously via identifiers identified to be the same thing here.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|see that that bothers me that they're the same thing.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|no no just the|D|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|because they're two different things.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|one of which is|D|Bed006|0
fe004|you could think of one a sub you know whatever pre condition for the second.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah yeah.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|right.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|yeah yeah.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|so so okay.|F|Bed006|0
fe004|so there's like levels of granularity.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|so uh there's there's um a single event of which they are both a part.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|and they're independently they they are events which have very different characters as far as source path goal whatever.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|uhhuh yeah.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|so when you identify source path goal and whatever there's going to to be a desire whatever eating hunger.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|whatever other frames you have involved they have to match up in in nice ways.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|so it seems like each of them has its own internal structure and mapping to these schemas.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|you know from the other|D|Bed006|0
fe004|but you know that's just that's just me.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|like i i|D|Bed006|0
mn015|well i think we're going to hit a lot of interesting problems.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and as i prefaced it this is the result of one week of arguing about it.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|between you guys?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|uh|F|Bed006|0
me003|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|okay.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|and um and so|F|Bed006|1
me045|yeah i mean i i still am not entirely sure that i really fully grasp the syntax of this.|S|Bed006|0
me045|you know like what|D|Bed006|0
me003|well it's not it's not actually a very actually it doesn't actually|D|Bed006|1
mn015|um it occur it occurs to me that i mean|D|Bed006|0
me045|right.|B|Bed006|1
me045|or the intended interpretation of this.|S|Bed006|1
me045|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|um well i should have we should have added an an x m l example.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|or some x m l examples.|S|Bed006|0
me045|yeah.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah that would be that would be nice.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and and this is on on a on on my list of things until next next week.|S|Bed006|1
me045|okay.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|it's also a question of the recursiveness and and a hierarchy um in there.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|do we want the schemas just blump blump blump blump?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|i mean it's if we can actually you know get it so that we can out of one utterance activate more than one schema i mean then we're already pretty good.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|right?|Q|Bed006|1
mn036|well well you have to be careful with that uh uh thing.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|because uh i mean many actions presuppose some um almost infinitely many other actions.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|so if you go to a bakery you have a general intention of uh not being hungry.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn036|you have a specific intentions to cross the traffic light to get there.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
me045|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
mn036|you have a further specific intentions to left to lift your right foot.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|huh.|B|Bed006|0
mn036|and so uh uh i mean you really have to focus on on on|D|Bed006|1
fe004|right.|D|Bed006|0
mn036|and decide the level of of abstraction that that you aim at it kind of zero in on that.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|right.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn036|and more or less ignore the rest unless there is some implications that that you want to constant draw from from sub tasks um that are relevant.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|uh i mean but very difficult.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|the other thing that i just thought of is that you could want to go to the bakery because you're supposed to meet your friend there or|D|Bed006|1
mn036|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|you know so you like being able to infer the second thing is very useful and probably often right.|S|Bed006|0
me003|well the the the utterance was is there a bakery around here.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|but having them separate|D|Bed006|0
me003|not i want to go to a bakery.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|well maybe their friend said they were going to meet them in a bakery around the area.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|right.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|and i'm yeah i'm i'm inventing contexts which are maybe unlikely.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|right.|B|Bed006|1
me003|sure it|D|Bed006|0
me003|okay.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|but yeah i mean like|D|Bed006|1
me003|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|but it's still the case that um you could you could override that default by giving extra information.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|uhhuh yeah.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|which is to me a reason why you would keep the inference of that separate from the knowledge of okay they really want to know if there's a bakery around here.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|which is direct.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|well there there there should never be a hard coded uh shortcut from the bakery question to the uh double schema thing.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|right.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|how uh|D|Bed006|0
mn015|and as a matter of fact when i have traveled with my friends we make these exactly these kinds of appointments.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|exactly.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|we|D|Bed006|0
fe004|it's i met someone at the bakery you know in the victoria station you know train station london before.|S|Bed006|1
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn036|right.|B|Bed006|1
me045|yep.|B|Bed006|0
mn036|well|D|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|it's like|D|Bed006|0
mn036|i have a question about the slot of the s p g action.|S|Bed006|1
mn036|so the enter view approach the the the eva um those are fixed slots in this particular action.|S|Bed006|1
mn036|every action of this kind will have a choice.|S|Bed006|1
mn036|or or or or will it just|D|Bed006|1
mn036|um uh|F|Bed006|1
me045|every s p g every s p g action either is an enter or a view or an approach.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|is it change|D|Bed006|1
mn036|right right.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
me045|right?|Q|Bed006|1
me045|okay.|B|Bed006|1
mn036|so so i i mean for for each particular action that you may want to characterize you would have some number of slots that define uh uh uh you know in some way what this action is all about.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|it can be either a b or c.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|um so is it a fixed number or or do you leave it open it could be between one and fifteen?|Q|Bed006|0
mn036|uh|F|Bed006|0
mn036|it's it's it's flexible.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|um the uh|F|Bed006|1
mn015|well it sort of depends on on if you actually write down the the schema.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|then you have to say it's either one of them.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|or it can be none.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|or it can be any of them.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|however the uh it seems to be sensible to me to to view them as mutually exclusive.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|um|F|Bed006|1
mn015|maybe even not.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|do you mean within the source path goal actions?|Q|Bed006|0
mn036|uh uh uh uh i i understand.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|those three?|Q|Bed006|1
mn036|uh|F|Bed006|0
mn036|but|D|Bed006|0
mn015|and um how how where is the end?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|so that's|D|Bed006|1
mn036|no no.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|there actually by i think my question is simpler than that.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|um is|D|Bed006|0
mn036|okay so you have an s p g action.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|and and it has three different um uh aspects.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|um|F|Bed006|0
mn036|because you can either enter a building or view it or or approach it and touch it or something.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|um now you define uh another action.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|forced action or forced motion.|S|Bed006|1
mn036|it's it's called um uh s p g one action that has to do with writing a letter let's say.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn036|i mean not even within this context but a different action.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|um and this uh action two would have various variable possibilities of interpreting what you would like to do.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|and in in a way similar to either enter view approach you may want to send a letter read a letter or dictate a letter let's say.|S|Bed006|0
me003|oh the okay.|F|Bed006|1
mn036|so|D|Bed006|0
me003|uh maybe i'd|D|Bed006|1
me003|the uh|D|Bed006|1
me003|these actions|D|Bed006|1
me003|i don't know if i'm going to answer your question or not with this.|S|Bed006|1
me003|but the categories inside of action schemas|D|Bed006|1
me003|so s p g action is a category.|S|Bed006|1
me003|although i think what we're specifying here is this is a category where the actions enter view and approach would fall into.|S|Bed006|1
me003|because they have a related source path goal schema in our tourist domain.|S|Bed006|1
me003|because viewing in a tourist domain is going up to it and or actually going from one place to another to take a picture in this in a|D|Bed006|1
mn036|right.|B|Bed006|0
mn036|oh so it's sort of automatic derived from the structure that that is built elsewhere.|S|Bed006|0
me003|derived|D|Bed006|1
me003|i don't know if i|D|Bed006|1
me045|this is a this a category structure here.|S|Bed006|0
me045|right?|Q|Bed006|0
me045|action schema.|S|Bed006|0
me003|right.|S|Bed006|1
me045|what are some types of action schemas?|Q|Bed006|0
me045|well one of the types of action schemas is source path goal action.|S|Bed006|0
me045|and what are some types of that?|Q|Bed006|0
me045|and an enter a view an approach.|S|Bed006|0
me003|right.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|huh.|B|Bed006|0
me045|those are all source path goal actions.|S|Bed006|1
me003|inside of enter there will be roles that can be filled basically.|S|Bed006|0
me003|so if i want to go from outside to inside then you'd have the roles that need to filled where you'd have a source path goal set of roles.|S|Bed006|0
me003|so you'd the source would be outside and path is to the door or whatever.|S|Bed006|0
me003|right?|Q|Bed006|0
mn036|right.|S|Bed006|1
me003|so if you wanted to have a new type of action you'd create a new type of category.|S|Bed006|0
me003|then this category would we would put it|D|Bed006|0
me003|or not necessarily.|S|Bed006|0
me003|we would put a new action in the uh in the categories that in which it has the|D|Bed006|0
me003|um|F|Bed006|0
me003|well every action has a set of related schemas.|S|Bed006|0
me003|like source path goal or force whatever.|S|Bed006|0
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
me003|right?|Q|Bed006|0
mn036|right.|D|Bed006|1
me003|so we would put write a letter in the categories uh that in which it had it had uh schemas|D|Bed006|0
me045|there could be a communication event action or something like that.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
me003|exactly.|S|Bed006|1
me045|and you could write it.|S|Bed006|0
me003|schemas uh that of that type.|S|Bed006|1
me003|and then later you know there the we have a communication event action where we'd define it down there as|D|Bed006|1
fe004|huh.|D|Bed006|0
fe004|so there's a bit a redundancy.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|right?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|in in which the things that go into a particular you have categories at the top under action schema.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|and the things that go under a particular category are um supposed to have a corresponding schema definition for that type.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|so i guess what's the function of having it up there too?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|i mean i guess i'm wondering whether you could just have.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|under action schema you could just sort of say whatever you know it's going to be enter view or approach or whatever number of things.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|and partly because you need to know somewhere that those things fall into some categories.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|and it may be multiple categories as you say which is um the reason why it gets a little messy.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|um but if it has if it's supposed to be categorized in category x then the corresponding schema x will be among the structures that that follow.|S|Bed006|0
me003|right.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
me003|well this is one of things we were arguing about.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|that's like|D|Bed006|0
mn015|this is this|D|Bed006|1
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|sorry.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|this is this is more this is probably the way that that's the way that seemed more intuitive to johno i guess.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|you didn't tell me to|D|Bed006|0
mn015|also for a while for|D|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|but now you guys have seen the light.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|no no no uh we have not we have not seen the light.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|so|F|Bed006|0
me003|no.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|it's easy to go back and forth.|S|Bed006|0
me003|the the reason one reason we're doing it this way is in case there's extra structure that's in the enter action that's not captured by the schemas.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|isn't it?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|i agree.|F|Bed006|0
fe004|right.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|right.|F|Bed006|0
me003|right?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|which is why i would think you would say enter.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|and then just say all the things that are relevant specifically to enter.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|and then the things that are abstract will be in the abstract things as well.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|and that's why the bindings become useful.|S|Bed006|0
me003|right but|D|Bed006|1
me045|you'd like so you're saying you could practically turn this structure inside out?|Q|Bed006|0
me045|or something?|Q|Bed006|0
me045|or|D|Bed006|0
fe004|um i see what you mean by that.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|no basically|D|Bed006|0
fe004|but i i don't if i would i would need to have have that.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|get get rid of the sort of s p g slash something.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|right.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|uh or the sub actions category.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|because what does that tell us?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|um and i agree that you know this is something we need to discuss.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|in fact what you could say is for enter|D|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|you could say here list all the kinds of schemas that on the category that|D|Bed006|1
me045|list all the parent categories.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|you know|D|Bed006|1
fe004|list all the parent categories.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|it's just like a frame hierarchy.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|right?|Q|Bed006|1
me045|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|like you have these blended frames.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|so you would say enter and you'd say my parent frames are such and such.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|and then those are the ones that actually you then actually define and say how the roles bind to your specific roles.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|which will probably be richer and fuller and have other stuff in there.|S|Bed006|1
me045|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
me045|this sounds like a paper i've read around here recently in terms of|D|Bed006|0
fe004|yeah it could be not a coincidence.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|like i said i'm sure i'm just hitting everything with a hammer that i developed.|S|Bed006|1
me045|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|but i mean you know uh it's|D|Bed006|1
fe004|i'm just telling you what i think.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|you just hit the button and it's like|D|Bed006|1
mn015|and i guess uh|D|Bed006|0
me045|yeah i mean but there's a good question here.|S|Bed006|1
me045|like i mean uh do you when do you need|D|Bed006|1
me045|damn this headset!|S|Bed006|1
me045|when you this uh|D|Bed006|1
fe004|metacomment.|S|Bed006|0
me045|uh|F|Bed006|1
me045|yeah that's all recorded.|S|Bed006|1
me045|um|F|Bed006|1
fe004|damn this project!|S|Bed006|0
me045|why do you|D|Bed006|1
fe004|no just kidding.|S|Bed006|0
me045|i don't know like|D|Bed006|1
me045|how do i how do i come at this question?|Q|Bed006|1
me045|um|F|Bed006|1
me045|i just don't see why you would|D|Bed006|1
me045|i mean does|D|Bed006|1
me045|who uses this uh this data structure?|Q|Bed006|1
me045|you know like do you say all right i'm going to uh do an s p g action?|Q|Bed006|1
me045|and then you know somebody either the computer or the user says all right well i know i want to do a source path goal action so what are my choices among that.|S|Bed006|1
me045|and oh okay so i can do an enter view approach.|S|Bed006|1
me045|it's not like that.|S|Bed006|1
me045|right?|Q|Bed006|1
me045|it's more like you say i want to uh i want to do an enter.|S|Bed006|1
me003|well only one of|D|Bed006|0
me045|and then you're more interested in knowing what the parent categories are of that.|S|Bed006|1
me045|right?|Q|Bed006|1
me045|so that the um the uh sort of representation that you were just talking about seems more relevant to the kinds of things you would have to do?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|huh.|B|Bed006|0
me003|i'd|D|Bed006|1
me003|i think i'd|D|Bed006|1
me003|i'm not sure if i understand your question.|S|Bed006|1
me003|only one of those things are going to be lit up when we pass this on.|S|Bed006|1
me045|okay.|S|Bed006|0
me003|so only enter will be|D|Bed006|1
me003|if we if our if our module decided that enter is the case view and approach will not be there.|S|Bed006|1
me045|okay.|B|Bed006|0
me045|okay.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|well uh it's it sort of came into my mind that sometimes even two could be on and would be interesting.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|um nevertheless um|D|Bed006|1
me045|well maybe i'm not understanding where this comes from and where this goes to.|S|Bed006|0
me003|well in that case we can't we can't if if|D|Bed006|1
fe004|okay.|D|Bed006|0
mn015|let's let's not|D|Bed006|1
me003|well the thing is if that's the case we our i don't think our system can handle that currently.|S|Bed006|0
me045|what are we doing with this?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|no not at all.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|but so|D|Bed006|0
me045|in principle.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|approach and then enter.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|the i think the in some sense we we get the task done extremely well.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|run like this.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uh|F|Bed006|0
mn015|because this is exactly the discussion we need need.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|period.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|no more qualifiers than that.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|no this is the useful.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|so|F|Bed006|1
fe004|you know don't worry.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and um and and i i hope|D|Bed006|1
mn015|um uh|F|Bed006|1
mn015|let's make a a a a sharper claim.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|we will not end this discussion anytime soon.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|i can guarantee that.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and it's going to get more and more complex the the complexer and larger our domains get.|S|Bed006|1
me045|sigh.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and i think um we will have all of our points in writing pretty soon.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|so this is nice about being being recorded also.|S|Bed006|1
me045|right.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|the um|D|Bed006|1
fe046|that's true.|S|Bed006|0
me003|the uh the in terms of why is it's laid out like this versus some other|D|Bed006|1
mn015|the people|D|Bed006|0
me045|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
me045|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
me003|um that's kind of a contentious point between the two of us.|S|Bed006|0
me003|but this is one so this is a way to link uh the way these roles are filled out to the action.|S|Bed006|0
me045|in my view.|S|Bed006|1
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
me003|because if we know that enter is a is an s p g action|D|Bed006|0
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
me003|right?|Q|Bed006|0
me003|we know to look for an s p g schema and put the appropriate fill in the appropriate roles later on.|S|Bed006|0
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|and you could have also indicated that by saying enter what are the kinds of action i am.|S|Bed006|0
me045|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|uhhuh yeah.|B|Bed006|0
me003|right.|S|Bed006|1
me045|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|right?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|so there's just like sort of reverse organization.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|right?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|so like unless are there reasons why one is better than the other i mean that come from other sources?|Q|Bed006|1
me045|again|D|Bed006|0
mn015|yes because the modules don't|D|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|uh|F|Bed006|0
mn015|this is this is a schema that defines x m l messages that are passed from one module to another.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|mainly meaning from the natural language understanding or from the deep language understanding to the action planner.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|now the the reason for for not using this approach is because you always will have to go back.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|each module will try have to go back to look up which uh you know entity can have which uh you know entity can have which parents.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and then|D|Bed006|1
mn015|so you always need the whole body of of your model um to figure out what belongs to what.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|or you always send it along with it.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|nuh?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|so you always send up here i am i am this person and i can have these parents.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|in every message.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|okay so it's just like a pain to have to send it.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|which|D|Bed006|1
mn015|it may or may not be a just a pain.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|it's it's|D|Bed006|1
mn015|i'm completely willing to to to throw all of this away.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|okay i understand.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and completely redo it.|S|Bed006|1
me045|well|D|Bed006|0
mn015|you know and and and it after some iterations we may just do that.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
me045|i i would just like to ask um like if it could happen for next time.|S|Bed006|1
me045|i mean just because i'm new.|S|Bed006|1
me045|and i don't really just i just don't know what to make of this.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
me045|and what this is for and stuff like that you know.|S|Bed006|1
me045|so if someone could make an example of what would actually be in it|D|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
me045|like first of all what modules are talking to each other using this.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah we i will promise for the next time to have fleshed out n x m l examples for a a run through and and see how this this then translates.|S|Bed006|0
me045|right?|Q|Bed006|1
me045|and|D|Bed006|1
me045|okay.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|be great.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and how this can come about.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|nuh?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|including the sort of miracle occurs here um part.|S|Bed006|1
me045|right.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|and um|F|Bed006|1
mn015|is there more to be said?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|i think|D|Bed006|1
mn015|um|F|Bed006|1
mn015|in principle what i i think that this approach does|D|Bed006|1
mn015|and whether or not we take the enter view and we all throw up up the ladder|D|Bed006|1
mn015|um how do how does professor peter call that?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|the uh silence sublimination?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|throwing somebody up the stairs?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|have you never read the peter's principle?|Q|Bed006|1
me045|nope.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|anyone here?|Q|Bed006|1
mn036|oh uh|F|Bed006|0
me012|people reach their level of uh their level of at which they're incompetent or whatever.|S|Bed006|1
mn036|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|maximum incompetence.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and then you can throw them up the stairs.|S|Bed006|1
mn036|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
me045|all right.|S|Bed006|1
mn036|right right.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|oh!|S|Bed006|1
mn015|um yeah.|F|Bed006|0
mn036|promote them.|S|Bed006|1
mn036|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|okay so we can promote enter view all all up a bit.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and and get rid of the uh blah blah x blah uh asterisk sub action item altogether.|S|Bed006|0
me045|okay.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|no no problem with that.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and we we we will play around with all of them.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|but the principal distinction between having the the pure schema and their instantiations on the one hand and adding some whatever more intention oriented specification um on parallel to that that this approach seems to be uh workable to me.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|i don't know.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|if you all share that opinion then that made my day much happier.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uh yeah wait|D|Bed006|1
me003|this is a simple way to basically link uh roles to actions.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|yeah yeah that's fine.|S|Bed006|1
me045|sure.|S|Bed006|0
me003|that's the that was the intent of of it basically.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|uh that's true.|S|Bed006|0
me045|sure.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|although um roles|D|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|D|Bed006|1
me003|so i i i'm i'm not|D|Bed006|0
fe004|yeah i i|F|Bed006|1
mn015|i'm i'm never happy when he uses the word roles.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|i was going to|D|Bed006|1
mn015|i'm|D|Bed006|0
me003|i i mean r o l l s.|S|Bed006|1
me003|so|F|Bed006|1
fe004|bread rolls?|Q|Bed006|0
me045|oh you meant pastries then?|S|Bed006|1
me003|yeah pastries is what i'm talking about.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|pastry|D|Bed006|1
fe004|oh oh the bakery example.|S|Bed006|1
fe046|bakery.|S|Bed006|0
me045|this is the bakery example.|S|Bed006|1
fe046|bakery.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|i see.|S|Bed006|1
me045|got it all right.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|right okay.|B|Bed006|1
me045|help!|S|Bed006|0
fe004|i guess i'll agree to that then.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|okay.|F|Bed006|0
mn015|that's all i have for today.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|oh no!|S|Bed006|0
mn015|there's one more issue.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|bhaskara brought that one up.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|meeting time rescheduling.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|i didn't you say something about friday?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|or|D|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|huh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|so it looks like|D|Bed006|0
mn015|you have not been partaking|D|Bed006|0
mn015|the monday at three o'clock time has turned out to be not good anymore.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|so people have been thinking about an alternative time.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|and the one we came up with is friday two thirty.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|three?|Q|Bed006|0
mn015|what was it?|Q|Bed006|0
me003|you have class until two.|S|Bed006|1
me003|right?|Q|Bed006|1
me003|so if we don't want him if we don't want him to run over here.|S|Bed006|1
me012|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|two two-thirty-ish or three or friday at three or something around that time.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|so do i.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
me045|uhhuh.|D|Bed006|1
me003|two thirtyish or three is|D|Bed006|0
me012|yeah.|S|Bed006|1
me012|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|um how how are your|D|Bed006|0
fe004|that would be good.|S|Bed006|1
mn036|uh friday|D|Bed006|0
mn036|uh yeah that's fine.|S|Bed006|0
me045|uh|D|Bed006|1
mn015|and i know that you have until three you're busy.|S|Bed006|0
fe046|yeah.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|so three is sounds good.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
me045|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|i'll be free by then.|S|Bed006|1
me045|i could do that.|S|Bed006|0
me045|yeah i mean earlier on friday is better but three you know i mean if it were a three or a three thirty time then i would take the three or whatever.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
me045|but yeah sure three is fine.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and you can always make it shortly after three probably.|S|Bed006|1
me045|i mean|D|Bed006|0
fe046|yeah and i don't need to be here particularly deeply.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|often.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|no but uh|D|Bed006|0
fe046|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|whenever.|S|Bed006|0
fe046|but yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|you are more than welcome if you think that this kind of discussion gets you anywhere in in your life then uh you're free to|D|Bed006|0
fe046|it's fascinating.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|that's the right answer.|S|Bed006|0
fe046|i'm just glad that i don't have to work it out.|S|Bed006|1
fe046|because|D|Bed006|1
me045|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|huh?|Q|Bed006|1
fe046|i'm just glad that don't have to work it out myself.|S|Bed006|0
fe046|that i'm not involved at all in the working out of it.|S|Bed006|0
fe046|because|D|Bed006|0
me045|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|uh but you're a linguist.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|you should|D|Bed006|0
fe046|oh yeah that's why i'm glad that i'm not involved in working it out.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|okay.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|so it's at friday at three?|Q|Bed006|1
mn036|there that's|D|Bed006|1
mn015|and um|F|Bed006|0
me045|so already again this week.|S|Bed006|1
me045|huh?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|how diligent do we feel?|Q|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|do feel that we have done our chores for this week?|Q|Bed006|0
mn015|or|D|Bed006|0
me012|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
me012|so i mean clearly there's i can talk about the um the parser changes on friday at least.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|okay bhaskara will do the big show on friday.|S|Bed006|0
me012|so|F|Bed006|1
fe004|and you guys will argue some more?|Q|Bed006|0
me045|yeah between now and then.|S|Bed006|1
me003|and between now and then yeah.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|and have some|D|Bed006|1
fe004|probably.|S|Bed006|1
me045|promise?|Q|Bed006|0
mn015|we will|D|Bed006|1
mn036|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
me003|we will.|S|Bed006|1
me003|don't worry.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|and we'll get the summary.|S|Bed006|0
mn036|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|like this the you know short version.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|like|D|Bed006|0
mn036|and i would like to second keith's request.|S|Bed006|1
mn036|an example would be nice.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yes.|S|Bed006|0
me045|yeah.|S|Bed006|1
mn036|to have kind of a detailed example.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|yes i've i've i've i guess i'm on record for promising that now.|S|Bed006|1
mn036|okay.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|so um|F|Bed006|1
fe004|like have it we'll have it in writing.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|so|F|Bed006|0
fe004|or better speech.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|so|F|Bed006|0
mn015|this is it.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and um|F|Bed006|1
me003|the other good thing about it is jerry can be on here on friday.|S|Bed006|0
me003|and he can weigh in as well.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and um if you can get that binding point also maybe with a nice example that would be helpful for johno and me.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|oh yeah.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uh|D|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|let's uh yeah they're|D|Bed006|0
mn015|give us|D|Bed006|1
fe046|no problem.|S|Bed006|0
me045|i think you've got one on hand.|S|Bed006|1
me045|huh?|Q|Bed006|1
fe046|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|i have several in my head.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|always thinking about binding.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|well the the the binding is technically no problem.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|but it's it for me it seems to be conceptually important that we find out if we can if if there if there are things in there that are sort of a general nature.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|we should distill them out.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|and put them where the schemas are.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|if there are things that you know are intention specific then we should put them up somewhere.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|so in general they'll be bindings across both intentions and the actions.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yep.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|so|F|Bed006|1
mn015|that's wonderful.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|yeah.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|so it's it's general across all of these things.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|it's like i mean shastri would say you know binding is like an essential cognitive uh process.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|so um|F|Bed006|1
mn015|okay.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|so i don't think it will be isolated to one or the two.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|but you can definitely figure out where|D|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah sometimes things belong and|D|Bed006|1
fe004|so actually i'm not sure|D|Bed006|1
fe004|i would be curious to see how separate the intention part and the action part are in the system.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|like i know the whole thing is like intention lattice or something like that.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|right?|Q|Bed006|1
fe004|so is the right now are the ideas the rich rich the r a d or whatever is one you know potential block inside intention.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|it's still it's still mainly intention hypothesis.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|and then that's just one way to describe the the action part of it.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|it's|D|Bed006|0
me003|it's an attempt to refine it basically.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|and yeah.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|okay great uhhuh.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|it's an an it's it's sort of|D|Bed006|0
fe004|not just that you want to go from here to here.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|it's that the action is what you intend.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|and this action consists of all complicated modules and image schemas and whatever.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|so|F|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah and and there will be a a a relatively high level of redundancy.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|in the sense that um ultimately one|D|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|which is|D|Bed006|1
fe004|yeah it's fine.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|so so that if we want to get really cocky we we will say well if you really look at it you just need our rad.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|you can throw the rest away.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|right?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|right.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|because you're not going to get anymore information out of the action as you find it there in the domain object.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|right.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|but then again um in this case the domain object may contain information that we don't really care about either.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|so|F|Bed006|0
mn015|but we'll see that then and how how it sort of evolves.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|i mean if if people really like our our rad|D|Bed006|0
mn015|i mean what might happen is that they will get rid of that action thing completely.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|you know and leave it up for us to get the parser input um|D|Bed006|0
fe004|huh we know the things that make use of this thing so that we can just change them so that they make use of rad.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|i can't believe we're using this term.|S|Bed006|1
fe046|you don't have to use the acronym.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|so i'm like rad.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|like every time i say it it's horrible.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|i see what you mean.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|0
me003|rad's a great term.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|is the|D|Bed006|0
fe004|but what is the why?|Q|Bed006|0
me045|it's rad even.|S|Bed006|1
me003|why?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|why?|Q|Bed006|1
me045|it happened to be what it stands for.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|well|D|Bed006|1
me003|it just happened to be the acronym.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|yeah that's doesn't make it a great term.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|it's just like those jokes where you have to work on both levels.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|no but|D|Bed006|0
fe046|just think of it as as wheel in german.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|do you see what i mean?|Q|Bed006|0
mn015|but if you if you if you work in in that x m l community it is a great acronym.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|like|D|Bed006|0
mn015|because it evokes whatever r d f|D|Bed006|1
fe004|oh.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|r d f is the biggest thing.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|right?|Q|Bed006|1
mn015|that's the rich sort of resource description framework.|S|Bed006|1
me045|oh rich|D|Bed006|0
fe004|oh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|and um and also|D|Bed006|0
mn015|so description having the word term description in there is wonderful.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed006|1
mn015|uh rich is also great.|S|Bed006|0
mn015|rwww|D|Bed006|0
me012|huh.|B|Bed006|1
me003|who doesn't like to be|D|Bed006|0
me045|everybody likes action.|S|Bed006|1
fe004|oh.|B|Bed006|0
fe004|yeah okay.|S|Bed006|0
me003|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
me045|plus it's hip.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|but what if it's not an action?|Q|Bed006|1
me045|the kids will like it.|S|Bed006|0
fe046|yeah all the kids will love it.|S|Bed006|1
me012|huh.|B|Bed006|0
mn015|it's it's rad.|S|Bed006|1
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed006|1
fe004|and intentions will be rid?|Q|Bed006|0
fe004|like|D|Bed006|0
fe004|okay.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|um are the are the sample data that you guys showed sometime ago|D|Bed006|0
fe004|like the things|D|Bed006|0
fe004|maybe maybe you're going to run a trial tomorrow.|S|Bed006|0
fe004|i mean i'm just wondering whether the some the actual sentences from this domain will be available.|S|Bed006|0
