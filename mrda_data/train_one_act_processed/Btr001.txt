fe008|so|F|Btr001
fe008|thanks very much for coming.|S|Btr001
fe008|okay.|F|Btr001
fe008|so um|F|Btr001
fe008|let's see.|S|Btr001
fe008|so um as you know the meeting today is to um benefit from your involvement in the data.|S|Btr001
fe008|all the things that that you've been exposed to in these many months.|S|Btr001
fe008|and um i just i just put down some ideas.|S|Btr001
fe008|you've seen some of this in the email that i sent out earlier.|S|Btr001
fe008|and um|F|Btr001
fe068|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|none of these these are not obligatory topics.|S|Btr001
fe008|but they're just things that i thought might be useful to discuss.|S|Btr001
fe008|just as a way of organizing the discussion.|S|Btr001
fe008|but if there are other topics you'd like to discuss that'd be great too.|S|Btr001
fe008|all right.|F|Btr001
fe008|so um|F|Btr001
fe008|it struck me that um you know we could start out with some sort of general thing about um things that you found easier or more difficult with respect to transcribing or checking or using the interface or uh dealing with the time bins or any aspect of that type.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then maybe talk about specifics specifics of the data.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then maybe talk about um aspects of the conventions.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then the technical set up regarding the um auditory image and the interface.|S|Btr001
fe008|okay.|F|Btr001
fe008|so|F|Btr001
fe008|maybe we could just um start with issues of the the up there at the top of|D|Btr001
fe008|what what did you find easiest or more most difficult about transcribing the data?|Q|Btr001
fe069|okay.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|one thing that i remember being really difficult at the beginning and it got easier as we went along was um acronyms and technical terms.|S|Btr001
fe069|um because there are so many.|S|Btr001
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|and it's a field that i'm not really very|D|Btr001
fe069|i don't know.|F|Btr001
fe069|i don't know very much about this kind of stuff.|S|Btr001
fe069|computers and speech recognition.|S|Btr001
fe069|i've never taken classes on it or anything.|S|Btr001
fe069|so i found that really hard.|S|Btr001
fe069|and i remember transcribing and having a bunch of|D|Btr001
fe069|you know every five words there'd be something i'd put in parentheses because i didn't know what it was.|S|Btr001
fe069|so|F|Btr001
fe008|parentheses meaning uncertainty.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
fe069|but it's definitely gotten easier because the same things keep getting repeated.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|once you learn what it is and you can say okay i know what they meant by that.|S|Btr001
fe069|or i know how to spell that now.|S|Btr001
fe069|or something like that.|S|Btr001
fe069|and the cast of characters that you put up on the web was helpful.|S|Btr001
fe008|is|D|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|also.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|okay.|S|Btr001
fe008|good.|S|Btr001
fe008|it's sort of like a foreign language isn't it?|S|Btr001
fe008|it's basically you have these specialized terms for things that i didn't know needed specialized terms.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe069|especially when describing like the set up in this room also and the different types of mikes.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|i don't know.|F|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|and it's hard to tell when people are talking relatively quickly.|S|Btr001
fe069|they just glide over some of the letters.|S|Btr001
fe069|they don't fully pronounce them.|S|Btr001
fe069|so you can't really tell even if you listen to it ten times what it is.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|i usually put most of the acronyms in parentheses.|S|Btr001
me070|because i think it's sort of safe.|S|Btr001
me070|because people can people can say their acronyms really fast.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|and i figure that even if i think i know exactly what letters they said it's probably best to put them in parentheses.|S|Btr001
me070|because i probably don't.|S|Btr001
fe008|that's not a bad strategy.|S|Btr001
fe008|i mean it's it's true that i i always check the parentheses at the last stage.|S|Btr001
fe008|and those are pretty easy to clear in terms of when they're in context.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|right.|B|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|not a bad strategy.|S|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe068|some of them just occurred over and over the again.|S|Btr001
fe068|so like p d a like that got got easy.|S|Btr001
fe008|yes.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe068|there there was a a bunch of them that uh|D|Btr001
fe008|i suspect in context|D|Btr001
fe068|they just kept getting repeated often and often.|S|Btr001
fe068|you know over and over.|S|Btr001
fe068|so|F|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|just got better.|S|Btr001
fe008|and also when you have the the juxtaposition of p d a and p z m then you know you in context you can tell which one it's is probably likely to be the one that you had.|S|Btr001
fe068|but|D|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|even though i still don't know what they are.|S|Btr001
fe069|i mean i assume they're microphones of some sort.|S|Btr001
fe069|but that's all.|S|Btr001
fe008|well these here are the p z m's.|S|Btr001
fe008|that right there.|S|Btr001
fe069|oh.|S|Btr001
me070|oh.|S|Btr001
fe066|is anybody wearing one of those awful quote crown microphones that people used to be|D|Btr001
fe068|no.|S|Btr001
fe008|uh you've heard the crown of pain.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|no he was telling us uh before the meeting that um that they're not in circulation right now.|S|Btr001
fe008|that they're they were unpopular.|S|Btr001
fe008|i liked them.|S|Btr001
fe066|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|and adam liked them.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh oh okay.|S|Btr001
fe008|i thought the quality was good.|S|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|just curious.|S|Btr001
fe008|what|D|Btr001
fe008|yeah what did he say|D|Btr001
fe008|he said some more things about that.|S|Btr001
fe008|but i was i was working on something else.|S|Btr001
fe069|about the microphone?|Q|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
fe069|i can't remember.|S|Btr001
fe069|i mean he's|D|Btr001
fe069|he he said that they were designed for a specific sized head?|Q|Btr001
fe008|uh yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah that's right.|S|Btr001
fe069|right?|Q|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|and so if if your head happened to be that size then you were fine.|S|Btr001
fe008|that's right.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh.|S|Btr001
fe069|and if it was bigger then it was like torture.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh.|S|Btr001
fe068|right.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|or i don't know.|S|Btr001
fe008|it's|D|Btr001
fe069|i don't know.|F|Btr001
fe008|i liked them.|S|Btr001
fe008|and there's the actually there's the picture of the of the crown adjustment on the wall right there.|S|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|so it sort of hooks over your ears from the back.|S|Btr001
fe068|right.|S|Btr001
fe069|oh yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh okay.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah good|D|Btr001
fe069|oh it doesn't look so bad.|S|Btr001
fe069|but i guess it depends really.|S|Btr001
fe008|okay.|F|Btr001
fe008|so now what about accents?|Q|Btr001
fe008|do you have uh did you find any|D|Btr001
fe066|they're tough sometimes.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|sometimes the german accents can get a little bit daunting.|S|Btr001
fe066|i mean|F|Btr001
fe066|um|F|Btr001
fe066|i forget who it was that i was transcribing.|S|Btr001
fe066|but it was tough to figure out what he was saying uh at any given point in time.|S|Btr001
fe066|and i would i would just listen to it over and over and over again going oh my god my head's going to explode.|S|Btr001
fe066|like not really understanding|D|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|you know?|Q|Btr001
fe066|and so|F|Btr001
fe066|i was getting a little frustrated.|S|Btr001
fe066|because i would put a lot of things into parentheses.|S|Btr001
fe066|and then go back over it.|S|Btr001
fe066|and go back over it again.|S|Btr001
fe066|and still|D|Btr001
fe066|you know?|Q|Btr001
fe066|i i like to try to clear as much up as i possibly can.|S|Btr001
fe066|and i i just felt like you know with the german accents just for me personally those were probably the toughest to get around.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|um they weren't impossible.|S|Btr001
fe066|but just like they the they took the most time too.|S|Btr001
fe066|i mean i would take maybe twice as long on a a given channel with a speaker who has a german accent than somebody who's you know a native english speaker.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|huh huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|or even asian.|S|Btr001
fe066|like uh speaks an asian language.|S|Btr001
fe066|i found that easier.|S|Btr001
fe066|uh|F|Btr001
fe066|you know.|F|Btr001
fe066|uh somebody who speaks like chinese or something.|S|Btr001
fe008|what's|D|Btr001
fe008|you've studied some languages.|S|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|which which ones do you are you studying?|Q|Btr001
fe008|it's more of a romance direction?|Q|Btr001
fe008|or|D|Btr001
fe066|um yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|well i studied i mean i studied old english for a while.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
fe066|um|F|Btr001
fe066|and then i've worked with larry hyman on like some of the bantu languages.|S|Btr001
fe066|um|F|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|and you know i'm also working with ian maddieson.|S|Btr001
fe066|and he's been doing work on the uh like also some african languages.|S|Btr001
fe066|so i've like learned a little bit.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|so it's not really you're not really exposed to german very much.|S|Btr001
fe066|no.|S|Btr001
fe066|i mean i sing in german.|S|Btr001
fe008|uh interesting.|S|Btr001
fe008|interesting.|S|Btr001
fe066|but|D|Btr001
fe066|i mean i can i can pronounce it.|S|Btr001
fe008|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|but i don't know any.|S|Btr001
fe008|okay.|B|Btr001
fe069|that's interesting.|S|Btr001
fe068|huh huh.|B|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|i can do i can pronounce a lot of languages and not actually speak them.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|because of singing.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|for me i found the spanish speakers to be the hardest.|S|Btr001
fe069|and the german speakers i found a little bit easier.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|and i thought maybe that was because i had i took german for a semester and i've had exposure to german.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh.|S|Btr001
fe069|um because i had a lot of friends who were really into germany and german language.|S|Btr001
fe069|and|F|Btr001
fe069|but|D|Btr001
fe069|and i found that i could|D|Btr001
fe069|if they were pronouncing something in a certain way i could say oh well that's just the german way of pronouncing this.|S|Btr001
fe069|and then i figured out what they were saying.|S|Btr001
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|um but with the spanish speakers it was|D|Btr001
fe069|i've never taken spanish.|S|Btr001
fe069|and even though i've taken french and i speak french fairly well um i found the spanish to be much harder.|S|Btr001
fe069|and maybe also because the level of fluency for the spanish speakers was a little bit less than the level of fluency of the german speakers that are here.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh.|S|Btr001
me070|if you're talking about who i think you're talking about.|S|Btr001
fe069|i think.|S|Btr001
me070|are you talking about|D|Btr001
me070|um|F|Btr001
fe069|there was a couple of different spanish speakers.|S|Btr001
fe068|can we give names?|Q|Btr001
me070|can|D|Btr001
me070|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe068|we we probably shouldn't right?|S|Btr001
me070|is that|D|Btr001
fe008|it's a good question.|S|Btr001
fe008|um|F|Btr001
fe008|and i can't really answer that.|S|Btr001
me070|okay.|S|Btr001
me070|well there's one in particular who i find the hardest to transcribe of all.|S|Btr001
me070|and it's she's spanish.|S|Btr001
fe008|oh.|S|Btr001
me070|so|F|Btr001
fe068|oh yeah.|S|Btr001
fe068|okay.|S|Btr001
me070|and um|F|Btr001
me070|and i've taken lots|D|Btr001
me070|i'm fluent in spanish.|S|Btr001
me070|and so|F|Btr001
me070|um when i when i correct it i can i can tell that the person who um transcribed it before me probably didn't speak spanish.|S|Btr001
me070|because i can catch a lot of things.|S|Btr001
me070|like like no that's not what she said.|S|Btr001
me070|i can tell she's pronouncing pronouncing it the way that if you read it from a you know a spanish speaker's mind that you would you know pronounce it the way that you would pronounce it in spanish.|S|Btr001
me070|but the same time uh i can't get most of it.|S|Btr001
me070|because i|D|Btr001
fe069|huh that's really interesting.|S|Btr001
fe008|oh that's fascinating.|S|Btr001
fe066|huh.|B|Btr001
me070|i find it one of one of the hardest ones to transcribe.|S|Btr001
fe008|well what you can see is that it's it's her lack of of english fluency that's being|D|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|oh okay.|B|Btr001
fe069|i think so.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah that's that's really interesting.|S|Btr001
fe008|i do find that the german tends to be easier for me than than the others.|S|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|because of my exposure and interest in german.|S|Btr001
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|but um|F|Btr001
me070|right.|B|Btr001
fe066|maybe i haven't transcribed this spanish woman.|S|Btr001
fe066|i don't know if i have.|S|Btr001
fe008|i suspect you haven't.|S|Btr001
fe008|because this was uh earlier on that we had a lot of|D|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
fe008|actually she she was in the middle phase i would say.|S|Btr001
fe008|we had another spanish speaker who was earlier who was also difficult.|S|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah he was hard.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|but that's really interesting.|S|Btr001
fe068|he got easier though.|S|Btr001
fe068|because he started like he would say certain words over and over.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe068|and|D|Btr001
fe069|and you got to know his pronunciation of them.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe068|so when he said sign yah and it sounds like sign he was saying signal.|S|Btr001
fe069|i remember yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|yes yes yes yes.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah i remember that.|S|Btr001
fe068|and so i would transcribe it as signal.|S|Btr001
fe008|exactly.|D|Btr001
fe066|huh.|D|Btr001
me070|oh wow!|S|Btr001
fe069|and and uh the way he said mixed was really strange too.|S|Btr001
fe067|uh|D|Btr001
fe008|miss ed.|S|Btr001
fe068|meexe meese mees uh or something.|S|Btr001
fe069|miss ed or|D|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe068|right.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|which was you know you could predict it.|S|Btr001
fe069|he|D|Btr001
fe008|i mean if you knew looked back at it.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|that's kind of cool.|S|Btr001
fe069|especially because also in the beginning meetings i mean he'd say something and no one in the meeting would understand.|S|Btr001
fe008|they|D|Btr001
fe069|and then everyone would say what was that again.|S|Btr001
fe068|oh uh|D|Btr001
fe069|and then they'd pronounce it in english.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|and so i could figure out what it was.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|that way.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|interesting.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|okay.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah i mean he was never like|D|Btr001
fe068|it was never up to like a native speaker.|S|Btr001
fe068|but like that it got a little easier.|S|Btr001
fe068|um|F|Btr001
fe069|like his english fluency got better?|Q|Btr001
fe068|i remember in the beginning you had and you were just sort of like you were beating your head against the wall.|S|Btr001
fe069|oh i went crazy.|S|Btr001
fe068|but i it but it got better it got better.|S|Btr001
fe069|i i would skip doing that portion for as long as i could.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah i know yeah i remember.|S|Btr001
fe069|because i just couldn't deal with it.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|and|F|Btr001
fe008|yeah i had the same experience.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|sometimes|D|Btr001
fe008|and actually|D|Btr001
fe008|sometimes when people lack a certain level of fluency you can ask them themselves what did you say there.|S|Btr001
fe008|and they can't tell you.|S|Btr001
fe069|and they won't know.|S|Btr001
fe008|i think it's it's sort of a general variability when it's not when you're learning a language and you haven't gotten to a certain level.|S|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe067|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|oh.|B|Btr001
fe069|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|i also wonder if if it's partly that spanish has different pronunciations in different regions.|S|Btr001
fe008|i mean do you think that um that uh maybe|D|Btr001
fe008|i mean being|D|Btr001
fe008|i mean not that i would know that.|S|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|but i just wondered if|D|Btr001
fe008|um|F|Btr001
fe008|you know she was from probably continental spain versus you know other spanish.|S|Btr001
fe008|i wonder if that would have a a contributing factor.|S|Btr001
me070|i don't know.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh like the region?|Q|Btr001
fe069|i have no idea about spain.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|but i know that in france for example parisian french is much easier for me to understand.|S|Btr001
fe069|because i learned it.|S|Btr001
fe069|versus france in like marseilles or in the south or in like the like the villages in the south.|S|Btr001
fe066|sure.|B|Btr001
fe066|right.|B|Btr001
fe069|it's really hard to understand.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|menton.|S|Btr001
fe068|or in quebec.|S|Btr001
fe008|that's right.|B|Btr001
fe068|right?|Q|Btr001
fe068|in canada it'd be|D|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|right.|B|Btr001
fe068|it's different.|S|Btr001
fe069|much different.|S|Btr001
fe068|a lot of the pronunciations are different.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe008|and in my case with with uh german i a certain region that i do well in.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then get farther away from that region.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|and i notice it's more and more difficult.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|there's another language that's spoken in spain too that's um|D|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe066|what am i thinking of?|Q|Btr001
fe068|castillian?|Q|Btr001
fe066|castillian.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|and uh|F|Btr001
fe069|and|D|Btr001
fe066|um|F|Btr001
fe069|isn't it catalan?|Q|Btr001
fe066|catalan.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|so maybe i mean depending on where she is like maybe|D|Btr001
fe008|but she was also very low volume.|S|Btr001
fe008|and um and didn't say a lot.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe067|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|i mean i i i i totally agree.|S|Btr001
fe008|this was a a difficult person to to understand.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|well the last one i did she actually said a lot.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|but|F|Btr001
me070|and it was kind of it was very hard to transcribe.|S|Btr001
me070|you|D|Btr001
me070|it was i just think that um her fluency in english wasn't um wasn't very very high up there.|S|Btr001
me070|so it was really difficult.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|but i mean i did find that knowing spanish helped me a lot.|S|Btr001
fe008|i can imagine that.|S|Btr001
me070|i could tell that a lot of things that the other transcriber had put in parentheses i was like i can see how you how you couldn't understand that.|S|Btr001
fe068|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|but i i i think i know what she's doing.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah yeah yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|i mean i think i know the mistake she's making.|S|Btr001
me070|and|F|Btr001
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|that's really good.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe069|because that's definitely something that i wouldn't have be able to do.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|yeah i couldn't do it in spanish.|S|Btr001
fe008|i've i found myself doing that somewhat in in german.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|german.|S|Btr001
me070|in german.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|there were problems even with um english speakers though.|S|Btr001
fe069|i mean not in their level of fluency obviously.|S|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|but in|D|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|some people tend to mumble.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|that's right.|S|Btr001
fe069|and|D|Btr001
fe069|and it's hard to catch what it is.|S|Btr001
fe069|is because it goes by really quickly.|S|Btr001
fe069|and you can't really tell.|S|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|and|F|Btr001
fe008|or they're laughing when they're talking.|S|Btr001
fe069|that too.|S|Btr001
fe008|or they're|D|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe067|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|that too.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe069|or just|D|Btr001
fe069|i don't know.|S|Btr001
fe069|and some people tend to get interrupted more.|S|Btr001
fe069|i know that's not something that the person themselves can control.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|but|D|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|if when people talk over one another like constantly like there's this whole barrage of voices coming from everywhere.|S|Btr001
fe069|um|F|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|it's like oh my god.|S|Btr001
fe066|what's going on right now.|S|Btr001
fe069|especially when they're when you were using the the mikes that weren't headmounted mikes.|S|Btr001
fe066|it's kind of|D|Btr001
fe008|oh.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|and there was input from other people on the same channel as the person who was talking.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|and that was really hard to deal with.|S|Btr001
fe008|we had lapels for|D|Btr001
fe008|and then sometimes people would wear these around their necks.|S|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|which would mean really basically uh a problem that you're saying of getting input from others.|S|Btr001
fe067|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|oh yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe068|right.|B|Btr001
fe008|and also um it varying when they change their head position.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe068|right.|S|Btr001
fe008|but|D|Btr001
fe068|a big|D|Btr001
fe068|i i think the transcriptions improved immensely.|S|Btr001
fe068|like exponentially.|S|Btr001
fe068|um after it was able to sort of isolate a single person onto a single channel.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|oh excellent.|S|Btr001
fe069|absolutely.|S|Btr001
fe068|um|F|Btr001
fe008|oh good to know.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|oh there's no question.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe067|oh yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|um|F|Btr001
fe008|so that was you're talking about early on the change into channeltrans.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|you guys didn't have one channel per person before?|Q|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe068|no.|S|Btr001
fe069|no it was one like one ribbon for everybody.|S|Btr001
fe068|no.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh wow.|S|Btr001
fe067|euh.|B|Btr001
fe069|and you had to kind of|D|Btr001
fe069|you could switch signals.|S|Btr001
fe069|like you could listen to a different one.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|but you couldn't really|D|Btr001
fe069|well could you?|Q|Btr001
fe069|did we didn't do that very much.|S|Btr001
fe066|you couldn't visually isolate it?|Q|Btr001
me070|what?|Q|Btr001
fe069|you couldn't visually do it.|S|Btr001
fe069|no.|S|Btr001
fe066|huh.|S|Btr001
fe067|euh.|B|Btr001
fe068|no.|S|Btr001
fe069|and|D|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe068|and you had to mark interruptions by a slash.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
fe008|that's right.|S|Btr001
fe068|right?|Q|Btr001
fe069|and it was very hard to be precise about it.|S|Btr001
fe068|um|F|Btr001
fe008|overlaps.|S|Btr001
fe069|and it was very hard to tell.|S|Btr001
fe069|i had so much trouble at the very beginning trying to figure out who was who.|S|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|because there's so many men and so few women.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|the women were easy to figure out who was who.|S|Btr001
fe069|and then the men all their voices sounded the same.|S|Btr001
fe069|except i think there was one british english speaker.|S|Btr001
fe069|and that was easy.|S|Btr001
fe069|but|F|Btr001
me070|wow that's difficult.|S|Btr001
fe069|uh yeah.|S|Btr001
fe068|you know what?|Q|Btr001
fe068|there might be a gender thing there though too.|S|Btr001
fe067|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|because i think i think as women it might be easier to differentiate|D|Btr001
fe068|well there were fewer women too.|S|Btr001
fe068|but i i wonder if a man transcribing all the guys would have had|D|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|an easier time?|Q|Btr001
fe068|like if you had transcribed it you would have had an easier time differentiating them.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe068|i don't know why that would be true.|S|Btr001
fe008|that's interesting.|S|Btr001
fe066|that's possible.|S|Btr001
fe068|but|F|Btr001
fe069|that's possible.|S|Btr001
fe068|you wonder if there'd be like a gender difference there?|Q|Btr001
fe068|i don't know.|S|Btr001
fe068|i'm thinking about it as like a psychologist i suppose.|S|Btr001
fe069|i don't know.|S|Btr001
fe008|it's possible.|S|Btr001
fe068|anyway.|F|Btr001
fe066|well it's|D|Btr001
fe008|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|oh yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah that's possible.|S|Btr001
fe008|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|i was just going to say something.|S|Btr001
fe066|i was going to say that|D|Btr001
fe066|i mean it's easier for people to mimic like the timbre of somebody's voice if it's the same if uh that person's voice is the same.|S|Btr001
fe066|if that person is the same sex as you so maybe like implicitly people pay attention more closely to uh speakers of the same sex.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe068|huh?|Q|Btr001
fe066|i don't know.|S|Btr001
fe066|i don't know if that's actually true.|S|Btr001
fe066|but i'm just throwing that out there.|S|Btr001
fe008|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|it's interesting.|S|Btr001
fe068|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|i don't know.|F|Btr001
fe008|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|kind of an interesting research project.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|it seems like it's it's related to this production idea.|S|Btr001
fe008|how you you internalize what you're externalizing in a way.|S|Btr001
fe008|but|F|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah but it definitely got much better when that change happened.|S|Btr001
fe068|oh yeah.|S|Btr001
fe068|it was so it it became much easier.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe068|um|F|Btr001
fe068|you know.|F|Btr001
fe008|in the|D|Btr001
fe008|you've also gone through|D|Btr001
fe008|they've been here since the beginning.|S|Btr001
fe008|you've also gone through the use the introduction of the pre segmentation and that kind of thing.|S|Btr001
fe069|oh yeah.|S|Btr001
fe068|right.|S|Btr001
fe008|so initially they had to actually mark all the time bins themselves as well.|S|Btr001
fe067|wow.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh.|S|Btr001
me070|oh wow.|S|Btr001
fe068|right.|S|Btr001
fe069|that took a|D|Btr001
fe068|which wasn't as hard.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|i mean it took time.|S|Btr001
fe069|no it just took time yeah.|S|Btr001
fe068|it took time.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe068|um i find that i have to adjust the time bins a lot anyway.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|me too.|S|Btr001
fe066|me too.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe068|um|F|Btr001
me070|i always adjust the time bins.|S|Btr001
fe067|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|um not for the end of the utterance but for the beginning.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|sometimes the beginning the person started to say something.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|i see.|S|Btr001
fe067|really?|Q|Btr001
fe068|it's a very slight difference.|S|Btr001
fe068|and then the time bin starts.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah that happens a lot.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah right.|B|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|right.|B|Btr001
fe068|um so you have to just move it back a little bit.|S|Btr001
fe068|and and i think you mentioned at some point that you wanted a little pad of time anyway.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|it doesn't hurt to have a pad.|S|Btr001
fe008|it's it's nicer to have a pad than not.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|then to have it be cut off.|S|Btr001
fe008|but don't have to be really yeah don't doesn't have to be|D|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|don't have it just start.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|i always wonder about the um time bins.|S|Btr001
fe069|i thought|D|Btr001
fe068|um so.|F|Btr001
me070|i mean i usually ended adjusting them a little bit.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|i mean|F|Btr001
me070|definitely when something's cut off at the beginning or the end.|S|Btr001
me070|but also sometimes there's just like huge pads of you know air before and or after um that i don't really feel is necessary for that segment.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|and i usually um you know shrink it a bit.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|shrink in them or whatever.|S|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|nice.|S|Btr001
me070|and make it a little bit|D|Btr001
fe067|seems like i always have to cut off pads at the end.|S|Btr001
fe008|nice.|S|Btr001
fe067|i don't have so much problem at the beginning.|S|Btr001
fe067|but|F|Btr001
fe069|of breath or of uh nothing?|Q|Btr001
fe067|no of just nothing.|S|Btr001
me070|just nothing.|S|Btr001
fe067|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|huh yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah there's nothing going on.|S|Btr001
fe066|at the beginning it seems to happen when um voicing occurs later.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|you know like|D|Btr001
fe069|with fricatives a lot.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah with fricatives and with like uh|D|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|i mean like it doesn't happen with uh like buh so much.|S|Btr001
fe066|because you've got the pre voicing before the consonant actually begins.|S|Btr001
fe069|although i found one in actually i was just working right before this meeting one where someone said great.|S|Btr001
fe069|and|F|Btr001
fe069|the the g it was pronounced as a k.|S|Btr001
fe069|so it was unvoiced.|S|Btr001
fe069|and then part of the r was cut off in the beginning.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh.|S|Btr001
fe069|and then|D|Btr001
fe069|you it sounded like great.|S|Btr001
fe069|if you just listened to that time bin it still sounded like great.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|but if you listened to right before it you could hear a little the the k or whatever and a little bit of the r.|S|Btr001
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|so|D|Btr001
fe069|i don't know.|F|Btr001
fe066|that's kind of interesting.|S|Btr001
fe069|usually it's not|D|Btr001
fe069|usually that doesn't happen.|S|Btr001
fe069|but this time it did.|S|Btr001
fe068|so for the non linguists what's a fricative?|Q|Btr001
fe008|i|D|Btr001
fe008|uh|D|Btr001
fe066|oh.|S|Btr001
fe066|uh it's like fff sss.|S|Btr001
fe069|or sss.|S|Btr001
fe069|or|F|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|oh okay.|S|Btr001
me070|or thh.|D|Btr001
fe066|shh.|S|Btr001
me070|it's a sound that|D|Btr001
fe066|it's like the noisy uh um like airflow ones where you've got like a a stoppage in your mouth.|S|Btr001
fe066|like uh like your tongue|D|Btr001
fe069|but it's not completely blocking the airflow.|S|Btr001
fe068|oh i see.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|and you can sort of you can sort of keep it going a little bit.|S|Btr001
fe066|right.|S|Btr001
fe068|oh i see.|S|Btr001
fe068|oh okay.|S|Btr001
fe067|unlike like a tuh or a kuh that just stops.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe068|right.|S|Btr001
fe068|got it.|S|Btr001
fe066|sorry.|S|Btr001
fe008|have you|D|Btr001
fe068|i guess i'm the only non linguist.|S|Btr001
fe008|well i'm i'm sort of a hybrid.|S|Btr001
fe008|so i i you know i i appreciate having them do this.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe068|oh right.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah oh you|D|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|so um in did you have you run into places|D|Btr001
fe008|i've run into a couple where actually the word was totally different when you adjusted the time bin.|S|Btr001
fe008|have you had that happen?|Q|Btr001
fe069|huh yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|oh yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|that's fascinating.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|F|Btr001
me070|i like that.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|oh it's really a kick.|S|Btr001
me070|i think that's fun.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|and it sometimes changes the entire utterance too.|S|Btr001
fe069|oh it does.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|completely.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe069|i i don't remember the words exactly.|S|Btr001
fe069|it's a shame.|S|Btr001
fe069|there was one that was a whole sentence was broken up in the middle and there was a little like millisecond of break in the middle.|S|Btr001
fe069|and|F|Btr001
fe069|if you connected it all together it completely changed what was right before it and what was right after it.|S|Btr001
fe069|it was written as something else.|S|Btr001
fe069|and then it became a word together from what was before and after.|S|Btr001
fe069|and then with this little tiny millisecond pause.|S|Btr001
fe069|so i guess i don't know i mean i guess when we talk in between different segments of the word maybe there's pauses somehow.|S|Btr001
fe069|i guess|D|Btr001
fe068|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|or the you can|D|Btr001
fe066|we stop voicing sometimes.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|or something like that.|S|Btr001
fe069|it's probably like inaudible for us.|S|Btr001
fe069|but|F|Btr001
fe069|and maybe the pause was just so short that it made up a pause.|S|Btr001
fe069|i don't is it that doesn't make any sense.|S|Btr001
fe069|but|F|Btr001
fe008|there are some times when there have been words that they just pause right in the middle of.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|you're|D|Btr001
fe008|it's|D|Btr001
fe069|on purpose though.|S|Btr001
fe069|or not.|S|Btr001
fe008|well|F|Btr001
fe008|it i'm sure sometimes on purpose.|S|Btr001
fe008|but sometimes it'd just be saying something and especially people who have really elongation in their style.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|and they say that's really fascinating.|S|Btr001
fe067|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|it's not a great example.|S|Btr001
fe008|but you know|F|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|and|D|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe008|uh there's|D|Btr001
fe008|it's it's funny how um|D|Btr001
fe008|it's funny to me that something like that you just change one little boundary and suddenly the whole meaning changes.|S|Btr001
fe008|and i've run across that also.|S|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah that is true.|S|Btr001
me070|huh would you want um uh a transcription of something like that?|Q|Btr001
me070|of a big pause in between in the middle of a word.|S|Btr001
me070|or just leave it as fascinating?|Q|Btr001
fe008|what i've done i've|D|Btr001
fe008|it's very rare i mean when i've run across it.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|and you know maybe there are times i haven't detected it.|S|Btr001
fe008|and i'm not you know i haven't looked at everything.|S|Btr001
fe008|i've looked at i've probably looked at uh at least eighty percent of the data.|S|Btr001
fe008|you know all the way through every meeting for about eighty percent of the stuff that i've cleared so far.|S|Btr001
me070|oh!|S|Btr001
fe008|and um|F|Btr001
fe008|it you guys are getting so good that it's like i'm i i i can get through them faster and i'm getting to the point where i maybe don't have to go through them all the way.|S|Btr001
fe008|you know?|Q|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|so it's like it's just we've gotten to a level it's just really great of um of of precision that um it takes a lot of a load off of me.|S|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|and um|F|Btr001
fe008|and so i'm not going to be checking them all i don't think in the for throughout the whole rest of the project.|S|Btr001
fe008|but um|F|Btr001
fe008|certainly have spot checking.|S|Btr001
fe008|but um hhh those that i have found that way to me i think the most sensible way to handle it from my perspective was to treat it as a pronunciation situation.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|so just do a you know a mark then fascinating and then put p r n and uh interrupted by a pause or you know some kind of other gloss like that you know.|S|Btr001
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|p r n.|S|Btr001
fe069|how it was really pronounced.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|right.|B|Btr001
fe068|huh oh right.|S|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
fe008|you know p r dot dot fascinating whatever it is.|S|Btr001
fe069|i always get confused with the pronunciation convention.|S|Btr001
fe008|sorry what was this?|S|Btr001
fe069|i get confused with pronunciation like when there's a strange pronunciation that i want to mark.|S|Btr001
fe008|okay.|B|Btr001
fe069|because i think|D|Btr001
fe069|in the beginning did we do the strange pronunciation and then write p r n and what it really was meant to be?|Q|Btr001
fe069|and now we're doing the normal word and then inside the brackets what it sounded like?|Q|Btr001
fe068|right.|S|Btr001
fe069|we did a switch right?|S|Btr001
fe069|or not.|S|Btr001
fe069|i don't know if it's just me that's confused or if it was|D|Btr001
fe008|well i've|D|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe068|i it it never occurred to me but now that you're mentioning it yeah yeah possibly.|S|Btr001
fe008|there was an adjustment.|S|Btr001
fe008|and i and i've switched them all all the way at this point so that|D|Btr001
fe069|okay.|B|Btr001
fe069|okay.|S|Btr001
fe069|so the convention as it stands now is write the word as it is normally conventionally spelled in english with the little apostrophe or whatever you call it.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|yep.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh that's right.|S|Btr001
fe069|and then p r n.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then in the brackets what it|D|Btr001
fe069|how it's pronounced.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
fe008|so you know okay is a very easy example.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|a person says huh kay.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|then|D|Btr001
fe067|oh.|B|Btr001
fe008|it's okay with a a little hatch.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then p r n and then huh kay or whatever it is in quotes.|S|Btr001
fe068|oh right.|S|Btr001
fe069|okay.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh right.|S|Btr001
fe068|i think nelson's the only one who uh|D|Btr001
fe068|oh morgan.|S|Btr001
fe068|you guys call him morgan.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah yeah.|S|Btr001
fe068|he's the only one who ever did that i think.|S|Btr001
fe068|huh kay.|S|Btr001
fe069|he does it a lot.|S|Btr001
me070|huh kay.|S|Btr001
me070|i|D|Btr001
fe068|he does it a|D|Btr001
fe066|okay.|B|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|F|Btr001
me070|and some people just say kay.|S|Btr001
fe068|um|F|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe068|kay.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah that's true.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah that's right.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|and of course you know i mean there's also this other reduction that that we've done in terms of like not capturing every time a person says and versus nnn versus you know nd whatever.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|all the different ways of reducing and.|S|Btr001
fe068|that's true.|S|Btr001
fe008|because you can assume that the speech recognition um uh pronunciation models will handle a certain amount of reductions of these types.|S|Btr001
fe008|and the same thing for um well the the versus the.|S|Btr001
fe008|that there are those known variants and|D|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|or a versus a.|S|Btr001
fe008|exactly.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|and that they should be able to handle themselves.|S|Btr001
fe008|and and that we assume also that for discourse purposes those distinctions are not really the focus right now.|S|Btr001
fe008|and those distinctions could be added later if needed.|S|Btr001
fe008|but it's unlikely that they would be.|S|Btr001
fe008|and it's so time consuming.|S|Btr001
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|so we've made these these simplifying assumptions with that.|S|Btr001
fe008|and so then you begin to think well what about okay.|S|Btr001
fe008|i mean maybe huh kay is an appropriate variant for okay.|S|Btr001
fe008|and it wouldn't be necessary to mark those either.|S|Btr001
fe008|so it's it's definitely there's a uh choice of how far you go with that and whether kay is is enough of a variant.|S|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|you know it's this is a case where um i appreciate it when people mark those kinds of things.|S|Btr001
fe008|but i i sort of figure that that that's not as far away from okay as huh kay is.|S|Btr001
fe008|so it's not quite so|D|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|but i don't change it back if it's there.|S|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|i think with like some of them like you know with uh the difference between the and the you can you can distinguished very uh definitively like what context they're going to be used in.|S|Btr001
fe008|you know?|Q|Btr001
fe008|yes.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|like um like you would say the apple.|S|Btr001
fe066|because it's the plus then the next word starts with a vowel.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|or the cat because it's next word starts with a|D|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|there's a study done on when people say uh and when people say um.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah i'm sure it's|D|Btr001
fe069|also there's in contextual variation.|S|Btr001
me070|oh really?|Q|Btr001
fe069|and it's predictable apparently.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|i haven't read the|D|Btr001
me070|i was trying to figure that out myself a couple times.|S|Btr001
fe069|it's really interesting.|S|Btr001
fe066|but something like|D|Btr001
me070|and i couldn't get anything.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|interesting.|S|Btr001
me070|i kept looking at all the uh's and um's and i was like oh this would be hard to do.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|oh that's interesting.|S|Btr001
fe069|you know what's on that sort of similar topic i just thought of something that's been hard for me sometimes is you can have a pronunciation of of the word a as a.|S|Btr001
fe008|huh?|Q|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|and then you can have uh like a pause or whatever as uh.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|and sometimes it's hard to tell what the person meant.|S|Btr001
fe069|are did they mean uh like they're pausing?|Q|Btr001
fe066|huh yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|or did they mean a like a person?|Q|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|i've run into that.|S|Btr001
me070|really?|Q|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe068|right.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh?|Q|Btr001
fe008|once in a while.|S|Btr001
fe069|and|F|Btr001
me070|i don't usually get|D|Btr001
fe069|you can kind of tell from the context.|S|Btr001
fe069|but sometimes it's hard.|S|Btr001
fe008|yes.|S|Btr001
me070|right.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe068|yeah that came up a couple of times.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah i|F|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe008|i agree.|S|Btr001
fe008|and and when i when i'm totally in doubt if there's a case where it really could be either and i could flip a coin i'll choose the one that would make syntactically the most sense.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|give them the benefit of the doubt that they're being fluent about it.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|sometimes i'll put in like a bracket like uh you know the orthographic a slash u h like if i'm really confused.|S|Btr001
fe069|like you can't tell.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|kind of go well there's two.|S|Btr001
fe066|so here.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|it must be really rare though.|S|Btr001
fe008|i haven't run across that often.|S|Btr001
fe008|is it rare?|Q|Btr001
fe068|huh huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|a few times.|S|Btr001
fe069|a few.|S|Btr001
fe069|it's really|D|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|D|Btr001
fe008|okay.|D|Btr001
fe068|it's rare.|S|Btr001
fe069|relatively rare.|S|Btr001
fe067|i don't think i ever have.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe069|i mean i can only think of like two or three occasions where i sat and thought about it for a while.|S|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|other times just you figure you look at it and what's the context.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe069|it's okay.|S|Btr001
fe069|i don't know.|S|Btr001
fe066|right.|B|Btr001
fe008|okay well let's see now.|S|Btr001
fe008|there's another another|D|Btr001
fe008|what i i want to ask you at some point it just occurred to me i'd like to ask you the following question maybe you can have this in the back of your minds something like um you know what sorts of hypothesis your hypothesis about the you know trying to find the distributional explanations for some of these things.|S|Btr001
fe068|huh?|Q|Btr001
me070|right.|B|Btr001
fe008|what kind of uh hypotheses have has this caused you|D|Btr001
fe008|uh i mean don't want to have you give away a paper topic that you want to explore.|S|Btr001
fe008|but|F|Btr001
fe008|you know if there's interesting uh hypotheses that the that have been suggested to you by looking at the data.|S|Btr001
fe008|that kind of thing maybe uh at some point.|S|Btr001
fe008|so|F|Btr001
fe068|hnh.|B|Btr001
fe008|and oh and i also want to say that um i'd like to meet again also next week.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|um and i don't know if this is a good time frame.|S|Btr001
fe008|uh maybe it'd be good to have it an hour later.|S|Btr001
fe008|or i don't know i mean could do anything.|S|Btr001
fe066|this is fine.|S|Btr001
fe069|this time is fine for me.|S|Btr001
fe008|about|D|Btr001
me070|yeah this is a good time for me.|S|Btr001
fe008|good time for you?|Q|Btr001
fe068|it should be.|S|Btr001
fe008|okay.|S|Btr001
fe068|um i know i have something in the morning which i don't normally have.|S|Btr001
fe068|i don't remember off the top of my head when it ends.|S|Btr001
fe068|um i'll let you know if it's it'll be a problem.|S|Btr001
fe068|but it should be okay.|S|Btr001
fe008|okay.|S|Btr001
fe068|two thirty should be late enough.|S|Btr001
fe068|so|F|Btr001
fe008|okay.|S|Btr001
fe008|excellent.|S|Btr001
fe008|because we could probably move it one hour later.|S|Btr001
fe066|in|D|Btr001
fe008|i mean i think unless|D|Btr001
fe066|i was just going to say maybe fifteen minutes later would help me a little bit.|S|Btr001
fe066|just because i have a class up at dwinelle just before this.|S|Btr001
fe008|oh i see.|S|Btr001
fe066|that's why i was a little late today.|S|Btr001
fe008|wow!|S|Btr001
fe008|you did really well.|S|Btr001
fe066|because|D|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe066|thanks.|S|Btr001
fe066|well i took the bus for part of the way.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|oh did you?|Q|Btr001
fe008|okay okay.|S|Btr001
fe066|but um that might help me just a little bit.|S|Btr001
fe066|because then it i you know i'm going to going to be hobbling a little slowly.|S|Btr001
fe069|then you don't have to rush.|S|Btr001
fe008|would anybody be constrained by having it be a full half hour later?|Q|Btr001
fe069|hnh nn.|S|Btr001
fe068|no.|S|Btr001
me070|no.|S|Btr001
fe008|okay.|S|Btr001
fe008|and the final question|D|Btr001
fe066|no.|S|Btr001
fe068|except we'll miss treat time.|S|Btr001
me070|oh!|S|Btr001
fe066|tea!|S|Btr001
fe008|oh that's right.|S|Btr001
fe008|oh i thought she said mistreat time.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh no!|S|Btr001
fe068|maybe we could have like a like a half hour then take a little break.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|mistreat oh!|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|then come back and finish the|D|Btr001
me070|well that's that's some good motivation to not start a half hour later.|S|Btr001
fe069|you know what we could do?|Q|Btr001
fe008|yeah you know that's that's that's an interesting|D|Btr001
fe069|we could just ask the someone like the front desk person or lila to like set aside a little bit for us.|S|Btr001
fe066|that's so funny.|S|Btr001
fe068|little bit of treats.|S|Btr001
fe008|hey they would.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh that's true.|S|Btr001
fe067|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|yeah they would.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|that's that's not a bad solution.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe068|it's not going to be birthday cake.|S|Btr001
fe068|so|F|Btr001
fe069|yeah so we'll survive.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|yeah that's right.|S|Btr001
fe066|this is very important.|S|Btr001
fe008|it's already done.|S|Btr001
fe008|it's good to good to have these things all scheduled.|S|Btr001
fe008|okay.|F|Btr001
fe008|so um|F|Btr001
fe008|oh.|S|Btr001
fe008|uh uh then i was going to ask you what about an hour later?|Q|Btr001
fe008|i mean if we had those things an hour later.|S|Btr001
fe008|like would people|D|Btr001
fe066|this is fine with me.|S|Btr001
fe008|okay.|S|Btr001
fe069|that's fine too.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|okay good.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
me070|yeah that's fine.|S|Btr001
fe008|all right so i'll i'll settle on that.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|okay now i wanted to say you've been through a couple of different uh improvements in the methods the pre segmentation.|S|Btr001
fe008|there was another another improvement in that|D|Btr001
fe008|well let's ask if it was an improvement from your standpoint.|S|Btr001
fe008|uh the tigerfish um approach.|S|Btr001
fe008|so|F|Btr001
fe008|uh moving from having the first transcription done by an external service and then you correcting that versus doing the initial transcription yourselves.|S|Btr001
fe008|how have you|D|Btr001
fe066|oh.|S|Btr001
fe008|and so i think you yeah i think you did you|D|Btr001
me070|i don't think i have ever done one from an external|D|Btr001
fe008|has there already been|D|Btr001
fe066|i have.|S|Btr001
me070|i i feel like they've all been done probably by another transcriber here.|S|Btr001
fe066|you talking about the i b m ones?|Q|Btr001
fe008|yeah i b m or if if it was dash t f.|S|Btr001
fe008|that's the tigerfish.|S|Btr001
fe068|right.|S|Btr001
fe066|right.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh yeah yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|oh yeah then i guess i have.|S|Btr001
me070|maybe the one i'm working on now.|S|Btr001
fe066|i could tell you something that i thought.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|so|D|Btr001
me070|they have different definitely a different style right?|S|Btr001
me070|do they end all them all in dots?|Q|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|like dot dot.|S|Btr001
fe008|there's a lot of that.|S|Btr001
fe068|yes.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe067|they used to.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|and they and they capitalize like every single first|D|Btr001
fe066|i really|D|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|and they put|D|Btr001
fe069|um not parentheses.|S|Btr001
fe069|what's it called?|Q|Btr001
fe069|punctuation after brackets.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|that's right too.|S|Btr001
fe066|yep.|S|Btr001
me070|oh okay.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah then i'm doing that right now.|S|Btr001
fe068|right.|S|Btr001
fe068|oh right.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|laugh period.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe068|something like that right?|D|Btr001
fe066|right.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|which makes no sense to me.|S|Btr001
fe069|no it doesn't to me either.|S|Btr001
me070|like that's not a syntactic part of that sentence.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|if|D|Btr001
fe069|but|F|Btr001
fe069|no.|S|Btr001
fe008|exactly.|S|Btr001
fe008|exactly.|S|Btr001
fe008|i'm glad you|D|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|yeah exactly.|S|Btr001
fe068|well they're not linguists.|S|Btr001
fe066|if|D|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe068|so|F|Btr001
fe069|no.|S|Btr001
fe066|if i could be completely frank i really didn't like the i b m ones.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|oh good to know.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah|F|Btr001
fe069|i didn't either.|S|Btr001
fe008|oh that's helpful.|S|Btr001
fe066|i found them to be just|D|Btr001
fe066|i just i i ended up basically redoing them.|S|Btr001
fe008|okay.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|um like from start to finish.|S|Btr001
fe068|i don't know if i did one.|S|Btr001
fe066|so when i was checking them like it would take me basically as long as it would have taken me to just to transcribe it by myself.|S|Btr001
fe008|wow.|S|Btr001
fe068|huh.|B|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|wow!|S|Btr001
fe069|i think it was a little bit faster than just transcribing it.|S|Btr001
fe008|wow.|S|Btr001
fe008|okay.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|but i definitely saw a lot of|D|Btr001
fe066|i'm really picky.|S|Btr001
fe069|there was a lot of errors that are not in the tigerfish ones.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|yeah tigerfish are better.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|and they just have better intuitions or i don't know what but about what's said.|S|Btr001
me070|which are what are the two differences?|Q|Btr001
me070|i'm not sure.|S|Btr001
fe008|i'm not sure if you had an i b m one.|S|Btr001
fe008|so this was earlier on.|S|Btr001
me070|so do i have a tigerfish one right now?|Q|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|if it says t f.|S|Btr001
fe066|if it says t f.|S|Btr001
fe008|you probably do.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
me070|okay.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe066|the ones that say i b m are like they actually say i b m.|S|Btr001
me070|so i don't think i've ever|D|Btr001
me070|the i b m ones were the ones that came in huge huge paragraphs huh?|S|Btr001
fe066|yes.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah and we had to split them up.|S|Btr001
me070|see i never got one of those.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah and you have to parse them all down.|S|Btr001
me070|right.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah yeah yeah yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|okay.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh yeah i didn't ever get one of those.|S|Btr001
fe008|so you didn't get one.|S|Btr001
fe008|oh interesting.|S|Btr001
me070|no i'm glad i didn't.|S|Btr001
fe066|okay.|S|Btr001
fe067|i didn't get one either.|S|Btr001
fe068|i think those show up in tigerfish too.|S|Btr001
fe068|because i think i've had a couple of tigerfish where i've had to break them up.|S|Btr001
fe069|where they have|D|Btr001
fe069|yeah but they're not like|D|Btr001
me070|they're not|D|Btr001
me070|yeah i can remember i used to see|D|Btr001
fe069|they're not huge huge though.|S|Btr001
fe068|a couple were.|S|Btr001
fe069|really?|Q|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|oh.|S|Btr001
fe068|and i had to sort of break them down.|S|Btr001
fe069|oh.|S|Btr001
me070|do they get them um|D|Btr001
fe069|i don't know.|F|Btr001
me070|is|D|Btr001
me070|they don't have like an interface right?|S|Btr001
me070|they just|D|Btr001
fe008|no.|S|Btr001
fe008|in neither case.|S|Btr001
fe008|and i'm and i'm thinking i'm thinking you're causing me to think back over what the differences were in the what they got.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|and i b m didn't|D|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|they just have they just have it segmented.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|you can tell because sometimes they have it so wrong.|S|Btr001
me070|and it's like well if you had just listened to what was before.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|but they don't have that option.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah but they don't have that.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah i figured that they didn't.|S|Btr001
fe066|right.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|right.|B|Btr001
fe008|there's also some iffiness about how if|D|Btr001
fe008|we're not sure really how tigerfish does it.|S|Btr001
fe008|you know the methodology.|S|Btr001
fe008|how do they do this?|Q|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|because sometimes you'll have the the same word|D|Btr001
fe008|and i've seen this like within|D|Btr001
fe008|well within a single turn it'll be spelled in three different ways.|S|Btr001
fe008|and it's like you know is this the same person who's kind of forgetful.|S|Btr001
fe066|huh.|B|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|or is it that they have several people doing it together?|Q|Btr001
fe008|you know maybe it's parallel.|S|Btr001
fe068|right.|B|Btr001
me070|right.|B|Btr001
fe008|maybe they're all doing it in parallel.|S|Btr001
fe008|and one falls behind and the other one.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|oh that's interesting.|S|Btr001
fe008|but who knows?|Q|Btr001
fe069|and they don't|D|Btr001
fe069|one person doesn't listen to all the channels of one meeting.|S|Btr001
fe069|right?|Q|Btr001
fe069|so they can't get clues from the other channels?|Q|Btr001
fe008|well you know the the way they're listening to it is they they get a they get|D|Btr001
fe069|or can they?|Q|Btr001
fe069|i don't know.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|it's linearized.|S|Btr001
fe008|so if you picture what we have on the screen.|S|Btr001
fe008|um you know there's this block and it goes over|D|Btr001
fe008|i'm doing it from my perspective.|S|Btr001
fe008|you have this block.|S|Btr001
fe008|and it goes over to here and stops.|S|Btr001
fe008|and this person starts to talk.|S|Btr001
fe008|and he goes over to here.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|and then you have an overlap over here.|S|Btr001
fe008|and so what they would get is this block from the first guy.|S|Btr001
fe008|this block from the second guy.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then the top of the overlap.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then the second guy in the overlap.|S|Btr001
fe069|oh.|S|Btr001
me070|oh wow.|S|Btr001
fe068|huh.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then it would move on.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|so it's sort of like this you know you go this way as much as you can.|S|Btr001
fe008|then you cycle through there.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then you go up to this next level.|S|Btr001
me070|so they hear all the channels at once like you guys were saying you first did?|Q|Btr001
fe008|and|F|Btr001
fe069|oh okay.|S|Btr001
fe008|um|F|Btr001
fe008|let's see.|F|Btr001
fe008|they hear them|D|Btr001
fe008|oh.|S|Btr001
fe008|uh they hear them separately in two chunks.|S|Btr001
fe008|but then sometimes they get confused about who the foreground speaker is because they're not being told who the foreground speaker is.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|you know.|F|Btr001
fe008|and especially you can see if you have like four speakers it be you can maybe find a way of doing that.|S|Btr001
fe008|but with nine speakers|D|Btr001
fe066|eee yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|so what they get is they get a beep that tells them when there's something that they think that the pre segmenter thought there should be transcribed in there.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|and so they'll get|D|Btr001
fe008|and it's numbered so that we end up with the same number of of transcribed slots.|S|Btr001
fe069|as there are slots in the pre segmentation.|S|Btr001
fe008|exactly.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
fe008|because the first time when we didn't have them numbered we ended up with a couple extra segments that were transcribed.|S|Btr001
fe008|and it was hard to patch the whole thing back together.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|because when it comes back to our end um it's just this long string of things that they've uh partitioned according to the tape that they were given.|S|Btr001
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|because they don't they actually don't have digital interface either.|S|Btr001
fe008|so it's it's audiotape.|S|Btr001
fe067|oh wow.|S|Btr001
fe069|oh wow.|S|Btr001
fe068|huh?|Q|Btr001
fe066|oh.|S|Btr001
me070|huh wow.|S|Btr001
fe008|and they type it on.|S|Btr001
fe068|makes it really hard.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then then it comes back to us.|S|Btr001
me070|wow.|S|Btr001
fe008|and adam and thilo have a program they put it back together into our interface format.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then we can use it.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|but|F|Btr001
fe008|um|F|Btr001
fe008|um there are cases where you'll get a segment and it's someone else's utterance.|S|Btr001
fe008|and that's because that was overlapping with someone else and this is the weaker speaker of the two.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|and you'll have like two totally parallel renditions of the same thing.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|because it's just|D|Btr001
fe068|right.|B|Btr001
fe008|so what they get is like is they get something like beep one.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then then they get beep two beep three.|S|Btr001
fe008|chuck wooters does the numbers.|S|Btr001
fe008|and um it cycles through.|S|Btr001
fe068|wow.|S|Btr001
fe068|oh so they don't|D|Btr001
fe068|do they know the names of the speakers?|Q|Btr001
fe008|no.|S|Btr001
fe068|oh okay.|S|Btr001
fe008|and they don't know which channel is supposed to be together.|S|Btr001
fe068|because|D|Btr001
fe068|okay.|S|Btr001
fe066|huh.|B|Btr001
fe068|because sometimes there'd just be interesting things where there'd be a misunderstanding about like|D|Btr001
fe068|like|D|Btr001
fe068|morgan would be speaking but it'd be on your channel.|S|Btr001
fe068|and it'd be like this is clearly not a woman speaking.|S|Btr001
fe008|yes.|S|Btr001
fe008|exactly.|S|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|yeah that's quite right.|S|Btr001
fe068|it's like how could they do that.|S|Btr001
fe008|and that's why.|S|Btr001
fe068|it's like well now it's it seems more reasonable that they'd make a mistake like that if they had no idea.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|exactly right.|S|Btr001
fe066|okay.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|god it must take them a really long time to do these.|S|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|um|F|Btr001
fe008|they're very fast.|S|Btr001
fe069|that's amazing.|S|Btr001
fe008|is|D|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|it sounds so hard.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|it it turns out that they're really much faster than the other approaches we've used.|S|Btr001
fe008|and we don't know exactly how they do it.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|and i think that that's by intention that not just me who thinks that it's that proprietarily it's a very competitive business.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|and they probably don't want to uh say too much about it.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|right.|B|Btr001
fe069|leak their secrets?|Q|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|but they're very fast.|S|Btr001
fe008|it's uh|D|Btr001
fe069|well i|D|Btr001
fe069|i definitely prefer not doing the transcript.|S|Btr001
fe069|i mean i liked transcribing because i felt like i was much closer to the data.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|and i had a lot more ideas like you were saying hypotheses of what's going on.|S|Btr001
fe008|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|and|F|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|but it took a really long time and i'd get frustrated with it.|S|Btr001
fe069|and i think that i would lose my|D|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|i don't know.|F|Btr001
fe069|i would not be as thorough.|S|Btr001
fe069|not be as careful.|S|Btr001
me070|i kind of miss it.|S|Btr001
fe008|excellent.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|i liked|D|Btr001
fe008|you miss|D|Btr001
me070|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|oh i see.|S|Btr001
me070|i liked transcribing.|S|Btr001
fe067|i kind of did too.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah i liked transcribing.|S|Btr001
fe008|oh interesting.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|i you know i feel i feel like it was um more personal.|S|Btr001
me070|i was|D|Btr001
fe069|it was more personal.|S|Btr001
me070|you know the this is sort of just you know correcting other|D|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|i feel like i'm just sort of like correcting a test or something now.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|you know?|Q|Btr001
me070|that somebody's already done.|S|Btr001
fe008|oh how interesting.|S|Btr001
me070|and|F|Btr001
me070|but i mean it's still it's still cool.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|but um|F|Btr001
me070|yeah i did i did like actually doing the transcribing a little bit more.|S|Btr001
fe069|you don't tend to notice as much i don't think at checking as you do transcribing.|S|Btr001
fe069|because it's already there.|S|Btr001
fe069|so you don't have to pay as much attention.|S|Btr001
fe066|that's true.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|okay.|B|Btr001
me070|yeah.|F|Btr001
me070|and when you're when you're um just checking you're you're usually just looking for certain things that you know are going to come up.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
me070|and i usually assume that um the words are mostly right.|S|Btr001
me070|although i you know i go through and i look and make sure all the words are right.|S|Btr001
me070|but usually it's like punctuation and capitalization and other things that i'm end up changing.|S|Btr001
fe069|and time bin corrections and things.|S|Btr001
me070|and time bins.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|i guess i'm such a perfectionist that i sort of combine the two when i'm checking.|S|Btr001
fe066|like i act as though i'm transcribing it.|S|Btr001
fe069|huh.|B|Btr001
me070|really?|Q|Btr001
fe066|and so|F|Btr001
fe066|yeah i really do.|S|Btr001
fe066|like i'm i tend to take a little longer maybe than other people doing checking.|S|Btr001
fe066|but like i i'm like ultra careful.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|i that's just how i am.|S|Btr001
fe066|but like i|D|Btr001
fe066|i think i really like think of it in terms of re transcribing it almost.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|and i only you know|D|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|so|F|Btr001
fe066|like i i change time bins a lot.|S|Btr001
fe066|and i like will change what people write like for whatever words they write a lot.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|right.|B|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|like|F|Btr001
fe066|so i guess i don't see too much of a difference.|S|Btr001
fe066|but that's just because it's me.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|like i think i like checking more for that reason.|S|Btr001
fe066|because then it's sort of it's like it's a it's a little helpful.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|it's like kind of you know somebody's helping me a little bit.|S|Btr001
fe066|but i'm actually doing the work anyway.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|right.|B|Btr001
fe066|is kind of how i see it.|S|Btr001
fe069|huh.|B|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|one thing that's annoying i think with checking is that a lot of times in the meetings you tend to have one or two people who talk a lot and the rest of the people just sit there until it's their turn to give their little report or whatever.|S|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|right.|S|Btr001
fe069|and yet you have to check the channels for if they did backchannels or if they did other things that you need to encode that weren't on the pre segmenter.|S|Btr001
fe069|but sometimes it's not visually easy.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|and so|F|Btr001
fe069|i'm|D|Btr001
fe069|sometime i debate with myself whether it's really worth it to sit there and listen to the whole thing or risk missing a little bit and doing it visually.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|it's hard to decide sometimes.|S|Btr001
fe008|and this is when you crank up the visual.|S|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|i mean you've still got the maximum|D|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah okay.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|well sometimes when you crank up the visual all it gives you is the background speakers.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|and|D|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah it's true.|S|Btr001
fe067|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|that's the thing.|S|Btr001
fe008|it's true.|S|Btr001
fe069|that's the thing that makes it harder sometimes.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|it's just a big mess.|S|Btr001
fe067|or if they're breathing loudly.|S|Btr001
me070|so|D|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|yeah that's right.|S|Btr001
fe008|well it's a judgment call.|S|Btr001
fe008|and you can also say well you know if the backchannels were so so low on volume that they weren't visually obvious then you can say well it's reasonable not to worry about them.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|the i mean|D|Btr001
me070|but also if they have it all pre segmented and they can only hear the segments they often miss what's in between.|S|Btr001
me070|because they didn't even have the option of listening to what's in between.|S|Btr001
fe069|you mean the transcribers?|Q|Btr001
fe066|right.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe067|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|so and you know the the segmenter usually misses little things like uhhuh and yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah that's right that's quite right.|S|Btr001
me070|and|F|Btr001
fe008|yeah that's right.|S|Btr001
fe069|and even bigger things.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|sometimes the segmenter will|D|Btr001
fe069|i mean you've said things that weren't caught on the pre segmenter.|S|Btr001
fe069|like whispers kind of.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|just like oh that's interesting.|S|Btr001
fe008|okay.|B|Btr001
fe069|or something like that.|S|Btr001
fe066|well like little sighs.|S|Btr001
fe066|or like inbreaths.|S|Btr001
fe066|like as though you're going to start speaking.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|you're about to speak.|S|Btr001
fe066|which i feel is important.|S|Btr001
fe068|uh|D|Btr001
fe008|yes.|S|Btr001
fe008|i agree.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|because it means that somebody's about to interject something.|S|Btr001
fe066|but then they decide for whatever reason that they're not going to.|S|Btr001
fe069|but then they don't.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|and oftentimes i find that the segmenter will miss those kind of things.|S|Btr001
fe066|those kind of vocal cues.|S|Btr001
fe069|and sometimes even laughs.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah breath laughs especially.|S|Btr001
fe068|oh yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe067|oh yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
me070|i usually take out|D|Btr001
me070|um i usually don't put in any of the breaths unless they're laughs.|S|Btr001
me070|i usually don't transcribe the the inbreaths or things like that.|S|Btr001
fe069|i don't either.|S|Btr001
fe069|but i mean i don't take them out if they're already there.|S|Btr001
me070|you know.|D|Btr001
fe069|i don't|D|Btr001
fe008|yeah it's it's good to|D|Btr001
fe068|if it sounds like a yawn|D|Btr001
fe068|i've transcribed yawns.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|um|F|Btr001
fe068|you can hear there's like.|S|Btr001
fe068|you know?|Q|Btr001
fe068|it like something like that.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|it well it's communicative.|S|Btr001
fe068|uh|F|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|or when it's a laugh.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|i mean often in the tigerfish there'd it would say breath.|S|Btr001
fe068|but it it it actually seemed more like a laugh.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe067|it's really a laugh.|S|Btr001
me070|it's a laugh yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|but it's a laugh.|S|Btr001
fe066|it's actually a breath laugh.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|and you can|D|Btr001
fe068|um|F|Btr001
fe068|because everyone's laughing.|S|Btr001
fe068|someone has just said something funny.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe068|and everyone's like uh ha ha ha ha.|S|Btr001
fe069|and everyone else is laughing.|S|Btr001
fe069|and then the other person is like ha ha.|S|Btr001
fe066|right.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|but it's not a actual laugh.|S|Btr001
fe068|right.|S|Btr001
fe069|but like|D|Btr001
fe068|it's it's not a very committed laugh.|S|Btr001
fe069|i don't know how you do it.|S|Btr001
me070|right.|B|Btr001
fe066|right.|S|Btr001
fe068|but it's still a laugh.|S|Btr001
fe069|you know?|Q|Btr001
fe066|it's no like.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah it's like.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|yeah i guess i'll laugh because everyone else is laughing.|S|Btr001
fe068|but yeah.|F|Btr001
fe008|have you noticed that|D|Btr001
fe008|i've noticed that tigerfish uses cough a lot where it isn't really a cough.|S|Btr001
fe068|it should be clear throat or something.|S|Btr001
fe008|you notice that?|Q|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|F|Btr001
me070|yeah yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh yeah.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|oh yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah i i just fix that.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|i'd fix that too.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|do you find|D|Btr001
fe008|you've|D|Btr001
fe008|this has caused me to wonder.|S|Btr001
fe008|so in tigerfish ones do you find that where they've where they have like dot dot's because it's segments they didn't hear that that you add|D|Btr001
fe008|you probably do add things in those places where it's where nothing is transcribed really because they didn't even hear it.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|you mean in between the segments that they did transcribe?|Q|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|oh yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|that's where you tend to find|D|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
fe008|interesting.|S|Btr001
fe008|oh interesting.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah you find little lost lost words in the middle.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|it's it depends on the person.|S|Btr001
fe069|i mean some people don't tend to do aren't that involved in the meeting or something.|S|Btr001
fe069|and they don't tend to say as much.|S|Btr001
fe068|huh.|B|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|um backchannels or whatever.|S|Btr001
fe069|and some people|D|Btr001
fe069|i mean|F|Btr001
fe069|i remember transcribing one person.|S|Btr001
fe069|all they did was clear their throat and breathe.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|and then read digits.|S|Btr001
fe069|and then it was like the end of the meeting.|S|Btr001
fe066|yo.|F|Btr001
fe068|i think i know who you're talking about.|S|Btr001
fe068|but|D|Btr001
fe069|so|F|Btr001
fe069|but then some people tend to|D|Btr001
fe066|there's one guy in particular who does that.|S|Btr001
fe066|it's really cute actually.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe068|uh|D|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|but then there are some people who are even if they're not actually speaking you can tell they're more involved or interested or something.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|because they're always uhhuh oh yeah really uhhuh um reacting yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|reacting.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|it just occurred to me|D|Btr001
fe008|this is a a different kind of question.|S|Btr001
fe008|but i|D|Btr001
fe008|from having listened to all these people|D|Btr001
fe008|is kind of abnormal to be listening to them as if you're they're talking into your ear really.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|you know it's this really unusual acoustic circumstances.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|right.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|um|F|Btr001
fe008|i sort of end up feeling like i know these people better than i really do.|S|Btr001
fe008|and it's like you go out to tea and there they are.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|and oh you were so funny in that meeting.|S|Btr001
fe008|and it it has this sort of unusual dynamic.|S|Btr001
fe008|because you know i i'm privy to information which really by all rights i shouldn't be.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|except of course they they agreed.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|they signed.|S|Btr001
fe008|they were there.|S|Btr001
fe008|they agreed.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|right.|B|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|but but it but it's sort of an unusual relationship to say|D|Btr001
fe008|you know you know|F|Btr001
fe008|if you're in the meeting yourself then you of course you'd have access to all this information and all your inferences about you know whether they're funny or not funny or whatever.|S|Btr001
fe069|i remember from the very beginning i would go to tea and start recognizing voices.|S|Btr001
fe008|but it|D|Btr001
fe008|oh that'd be interesting.|S|Btr001
fe069|and like turn around and be like wait that person doesn't look anything like i imagined them.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|yep.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|yeah yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|yes.|S|Btr001
fe069|uh|D|Btr001
fe066|you know who i kept wanting to meet was bhaskara.|S|Btr001
fe069|nnn.|S|Btr001
fe008|he's he's on campus.|S|Btr001
fe008|i found this out.|S|Btr001
fe066|is he really?|Q|Btr001
fe008|yeah yeah yeah yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|he has such a nice voice.|S|Btr001
fe066|i really like his voice.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|nice guy.|S|Btr001
fe008|nice guy.|S|Btr001
fe066|so i kept wanting to meet him.|S|Btr001
fe066|and then john told me that he's not around anymore.|S|Btr001
fe008|oh but he is.|S|Btr001
fe068|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|or something.|S|Btr001
fe008|i went on i actually went on a hike with him two weeks three weeks ago.|S|Btr001
fe066|so|F|Btr001
fe066|neat.|S|Btr001
fe068|oh cool.|S|Btr001
fe066|just curious.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe008|yeah yeah yeah.|F|Btr001
fe008|nice guy.|S|Btr001
fe068|i just wanted to know what liz looked like.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe068|i've never gotten to see her.|S|Btr001
fe069|nn huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|oh she's here.|S|Btr001
me070|i haven't seen most of them.|S|Btr001
fe066|i haven't either.|S|Btr001
fe068|she's got a nice voice.|S|Btr001
fe068|i know she's here.|S|Btr001
fe068|i know she's a big part of the institute right?|S|Btr001
fe068|so|F|Btr001
fe008|yeah i'm sure you've seen her.|S|Btr001
fe068|um|F|Btr001
fe008|uh but|F|Btr001
fe068|i must have.|S|Btr001
fe068|i just don't know who you know what she looks like.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|um|F|Btr001
fe068|yeah i think she's got a nice voice.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
fe068|but anyway.|F|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|she always tends to get interrupted.|S|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe068|it's okay if we say nice things about these people.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|right?|Q|Btr001
fe008|yeah yeah that's no problem.|S|Btr001
fe008|i also find that some of the|D|Btr001
fe008|you know if someone sits there and and|D|Btr001
fe008|it there's this one who doesn't say much.|S|Btr001
fe008|but she just is always pleasant.|S|Btr001
fe008|you know?|Q|Btr001
fe008|and it's kind of a smiling voice and she laughs.|S|Btr001
fe066|yes.|S|Btr001
fe008|and|D|Btr001
fe066|i i think i know who you're talking about.|S|Btr001
fe008|what a difference.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe008|i mean it's like|D|Btr001
fe008|actually it's|D|Btr001
fe008|um she's she's just so pleasant.|S|Btr001
fe008|and and you know adds a lot just by virtue of that.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|you know can people will talk on all these technical things.|S|Btr001
fe008|but she'll she'll say something technical and then laugh.|S|Btr001
fe008|and|F|Btr001
fe008|it's it's very interesting the ambience that you can get through these these little things.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|it's really makes it a lot nicer to transcribe.|S|Btr001
fe069|because there can be a lot of heated discussions about these very technical issues.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|and people will have their opinions.|S|Btr001
fe069|and you know|F|Btr001
fe069|and then you can|D|Btr001
fe069|it's really nice to have a little bit of humor.|S|Btr001
fe069|a little bit of break away from that.|S|Btr001
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|because it's hard to sit there and see like but don't you see you're being rude to this person you're cutting off this person.|S|Btr001
fe066|i know.|S|Btr001
fe069|and it's not nice.|S|Btr001
fe066|i started like kind of making mental friends.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|i'm just like i really like that person.|S|Btr001
fe066|you know what.|S|Btr001
fe066|i'm going to be his or her friend.|S|Btr001
fe008|i agree with you.|S|Btr001
fe066|and then|D|Btr001
fe008|i agree.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|it's it's really interesting also.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|it's a persona.|S|Btr001
fe008|you get this|D|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|there's definitely a sense of persona.|S|Btr001
fe069|you definitely get an image of|D|Btr001
fe069|uh especially if you can relate it to what the person or what you assume the person is uh interested in academically.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|it's really|D|Btr001
fe066|some of that computer stuff i just|D|Btr001
fe066|oh my god.|S|Btr001
fe066|i'll just sit there like going oh fff.|S|Btr001
fe066|it's going right over my head.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe066|i just i start zoning out sometimes.|S|Btr001
fe066|like i don't mean to.|S|Btr001
fe066|but i'm just kind of going i don't know what any of these acronyms are.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|and no idea what you're talking about.|S|Btr001
fe069|and there was a whole set of meetings that are like that.|S|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|that's right.|S|Btr001
fe069|it wasn't there?|Q|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|those were really hard.|S|Btr001
me070|oh yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|and they're writing stuff on boards and stuff that we can't see.|S|Btr001
fe069|really hard.|D|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|and it's hard.|S|Btr001
fe066|and so we don't know what they're referring to.|S|Btr001
fe068|right.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah all you hear is the squeaky pen.|S|Btr001
fe066|and so|F|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe068|and you're like oh no.|S|Btr001
fe066|right.|B|Btr001
fe068|something something's going on that i don't know.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah they're referring to this or that and the other thing.|S|Btr001
fe066|and you're just going no.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|i don't understand.|S|Btr001
fe069|no.|B|Btr001
fe008|yeah it's difficult.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah you guys talked about doing a videotape.|S|Btr001
fe008|yes.|S|Btr001
fe008|um it's mainly a matter of two things.|S|Btr001
fe068|sort of|D|Btr001
fe008|first is the storage it'd be so huge that uh you'd want to be sure that it was of interest to someone.|S|Btr001
fe008|that it would be worthwhile doing.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
fe008|and that's the other thing that we don't have.|S|Btr001
fe008|someone currently doing the video thing.|S|Btr001
fe008|it would really be interesting.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe068|because i know it was mentioned.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe068|also having a meeting where you all wore blindfolds.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|oh?|Q|Btr001
fe066|really?|Q|Btr001
fe068|it was liz's idea.|S|Btr001
fe068|wasn't it?|Q|Btr001
fe008|that was liz's idea.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|what would be the point of that?|Q|Btr001
fe008|oh well it's a question of feedback and being able to give feedback.|S|Btr001
fe069|oh.|S|Btr001
me070|oh wow.|S|Btr001
fe069|i think that would be really interesting.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh i see.|S|Btr001
me070|that would be interesting.|S|Btr001
fe066|so you have to do it vocally as opposed to visually?|Q|Btr001
fe066|like you can't use gesture.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|exactly.|S|Btr001
fe067|oh.|S|Btr001
fe066|uh.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|F|Btr001
me070|wow.|S|Btr001
fe008|and you know i mean that was the meeting where um you know the the partitions wouldn't work.|S|Btr001
fe008|another possibility is partitions wouldn't work.|S|Btr001
fe008|because then it would cut off the p z m's from having the indirect.|S|Btr001
fe069|right.|B|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|so it's like you have these unusual configuration problems that that you wouldn't normally have.|S|Btr001
fe066|right.|B|Btr001
fe008|yeah blindfolds.|S|Btr001
fe008|you know and someone else said well maybe you could just turn the light out.|S|Btr001
fe068|there you go.|S|Btr001
fe069|that'd be kind of creepy.|S|Btr001
fe008|but then someone else said no.|S|Btr001
fe066|cute.|D|Btr001
fe008|because there are these special lights that have to stay on all the time.|S|Btr001
fe069|oh.|S|Btr001
fe067|oh.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh.|S|Btr001
fe008|for the fire code or whatever it is.|S|Btr001
me070|oh wow.|S|Btr001
fe069|oh.|S|Btr001
fe008|but then|D|Btr001
fe068|i would just be so worried that someone would cheat.|S|Btr001
fe068|you know?|Q|Btr001
fe068|it's sort of like a prisoners' prisoners' dilemnas game where you know everyone's wearing their blindfold but someone could just cheat and look see what's see what's going on.|S|Btr001
fe008|that's right.|B|Btr001
fe066|are you raising your hand?|Q|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|totally.|S|Btr001
fe068|you know someone just leaves.|S|Btr001
fe068|you know.|F|Btr001
fe068|gets coffee.|S|Btr001
fe066|right right right.|D|Btr001
fe068|comes back.|S|Btr001
fe068|and no one knows.|S|Btr001
fe066|gets bored.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|i mean there are other things we could expand on and with in terms of the methodology.|S|Btr001
fe008|it's nice to have a core set of data though.|S|Btr001
fe008|and they've actually done some they've had some good results in terms of the digits.|S|Btr001
fe008|which they do in terms of having a a nice broad set of speakers doing the same thing meeting after meeting after meeting.|S|Btr001
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|so um|F|Btr001
fe069|that's good.|S|Btr001
fe008|i'm wondering|D|Btr001
fe008|um|F|Btr001
fe008|so we still technically|D|Btr001
fe008|uh you know i mean what should we do in terms of tea?|Q|Btr001
fe008|technically|D|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|if we could hang on for fifteen more minutes and have tea?|Q|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|that's okay.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then continue with this this next next week?|Q|Btr001
fe068|yeah sure.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
me070|okay.|S|Btr001
fe068|oh yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|it's okay.|S|Btr001
fe008|that'd be great.|S|Btr001
fe008|okay.|F|Btr001
fe008|so um|F|Btr001
fe008|let's see.|F|Btr001
fe069|i had something that i could bring up.|S|Btr001
fe008|yes.|S|Btr001
fe069|um|F|Btr001
fe069|as far as ideas about looking at the data and getting ideas about whatever you said hypotheses about how to figure it out.|S|Btr001
fe008|yes.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|one thing that i i'm you probably don't remember this that i was really interested in is the use of so and the use of or.|S|Btr001
fe069|because the way people use it in these meetings i found was|D|Btr001
fe069|i don't know if it was it if it's different than other people.|S|Btr001
fe069|i don't know if it's a computer speech thing.|S|Btr001
fe069|i mean computer people speech thing.|S|Btr001
fe069|but um|F|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|people tend to end utterances quite often with so or or and trailing off.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh yes.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|a couple people in particular do that.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
fe008|that's right.|S|Btr001
fe069|and i found that really interesting.|S|Btr001
fe069|and i was curious to to figure out when that happened.|S|Btr001
fe069|if it happened in certain occasions and whatever.|S|Btr001
fe069|and i never really got around to it.|S|Btr001
fe069|but|F|Btr001
fe008|do you people|D|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|i mean does everyone agree with that|D|Btr001
fe008|i mean i i share her intuition that's it's it is sort of unusual to have so used as a final uh part of a person's turn.|S|Btr001
me070|oh yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|i mean it's|D|Btr001
fe069|it didn't sound|D|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|i mean it doesn't sound like bizarre enough that i don't understand.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|but i don't think it's something that happens in just everyday speech really.|S|Btr001
fe066|i don't|D|Btr001
me070|i don't|D|Btr001
fe066|no i don't agree necessarily.|S|Btr001
fe069|really?|Q|Btr001
fe008|i was wondering|D|Btr001
fe066|i do it.|S|Btr001
fe069|really?|Q|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|i trail off with so.|S|Btr001
fe069|huh?|Q|Btr001
fe066|um|F|Btr001
fe066|i don't necessarily do it as often as the one speaker i'm thinking of.|S|Btr001
fe066|um|F|Btr001
fe066|but i do do that because|D|Btr001
fe066|i think partly because i want to make sure that people know that my my thought my utterance is finished.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|right.|B|Btr001
fe066|but that it's not necessarily final.|S|Btr001
fe069|like that you're flexible?|Q|Btr001
fe066|like you can|D|Btr001
fe066|right.|S|Btr001
fe066|or you can build on it.|S|Btr001
me070|right.|S|Btr001
fe066|or expound on it.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|i think it's sort of a like you guys can take from here.|S|Btr001
me070|you know?|Q|Btr001
me070|somebody somebody build on my thought.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe067|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|it's are you people also do it with but.|S|Btr001
fe066|it's kind of like a shrug.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah but it tends to happen|D|Btr001
fe066|it's like a it's like a|D|Btr001
me070|you know?|Q|Btr001
fe069|i mean so tends to happen when the person brings up a new idea that kind of goes against what the other people is saying.|S|Btr001
fe066|so|D|Btr001
fe069|or at least that's what i found.|S|Btr001
fe066|what do you mean?|Q|Btr001
fe069|like if someone in a meeting is talking about a certain thing and someone kind of interrupts or doesn't necessarily interrupt and says something either a new topic or a different take on the same topic will tend to use will trail off with so.|S|Btr001
fe067|oh.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh oh oh yeah okay.|D|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe067|uh like|D|Btr001
fe067|so you can see you might be wrong.|S|Btr001
fe067|but i don't want to actually say that.|S|Btr001
fe008|yes that's possible.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe067|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|kind of.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe068|huh?|Q|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|interesting.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|and or tends to be used with questions more than so.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
me070|that's true.|S|Btr001
fe069|but.|D|Btr001
fe069|i thought that was really interesting.|S|Btr001
fe066|or|D|Btr001
fe066|i've heard you say so in that sort of sense.|S|Btr001
fe066|like uh um so in other words blah blah blah blah.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
fe066|like a sort of an|D|Btr001
fe008|of course|D|Btr001
fe066|uh uh|F|Btr001
fe008|but that's not really an example of this.|S|Btr001
fe008|because they don't just say so.|S|Btr001
fe066|right.|S|Btr001
me070|nnn.|B|Btr001
fe066|but|D|Btr001
fe066|that's true.|S|Btr001
fe008|is that right?|Q|Btr001
me070|ending with so.|S|Btr001
fe008|i mean i just want to be sure.|S|Btr001
fe066|or i maybe i'm misunderstanding what you were|D|Btr001
me070|when you end with so.|S|Btr001
fe069|when you end the utterance.|S|Btr001
fe066|when|D|Btr001
me070|when you say something|D|Btr001
fe066|oh just just ending with so.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|right.|S|Btr001
me070|and you say so.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|okay.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|i i could get all those extra signatures.|S|Btr001
me070|it|D|Btr001
fe008|but i don't know.|S|Btr001
fe008|so.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|right.|B|Btr001
fe066|yeah to me it's like a vocal shrug.|S|Btr001
me070|it's|D|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|that's a very nice characterization.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|interesting.|S|Btr001
fe069|i'd definitely like to look more at that if i can.|S|Btr001
fe069|but|F|Btr001
fe066|that's cool.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh huh.|B|Btr001
me070|i think people end in but a lot too.|S|Btr001
me070|and i feel that that means that they want somebody else to take it up.|S|Btr001
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|or somebody just sort of like you know take it from here.|S|Btr001
fe069|oh yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
me070|so you know blah blah blah blah blah.|S|Btr001
me070|but.|S|Btr001
fe069|but i'm not really sure.|S|Btr001
fe008|once again a|D|Btr001
fe069|so you can you could finish my thought.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah so|F|Btr001
fe008|is it a shrug?|Q|Btr001
fe008|would you say it's another shrug?|Q|Btr001
me070|um|F|Btr001
fe008|or|D|Btr001
fe069|it's a different kind of shrug though.|S|Btr001
me070|i feel like it i feel like it sort of um asks for somebody else to uh put input in now.|S|Btr001
fe008|okay.|B|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|i could see that.|S|Btr001
fe069|i think it shows less of confident like less confidence in what they just said.|S|Btr001
fe067|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|okay.|B|Btr001
fe068|or giving permission?|Q|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|okay.|B|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|in a way.|S|Btr001
fe066|same with i don't know.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|you can also end an utterance with uh blah blah blah.|S|Btr001
fe066|but i don't know.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|like that.|S|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|like i feel like maybe that's similar to but.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe069|more similar than to so i think.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah that's interesting.|S|Btr001
fe066|to so.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|i think so too.|S|Btr001
fe008|huh?|Q|Btr001
fe008|huh?|Q|Btr001
fe008|interesting.|S|Btr001
fe008|what about um the way people treat when they give a joke?|Q|Btr001
fe008|i mean and and they're like they laugh.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then after the laugh they say uh.|S|Btr001
fe008|i mean|F|Btr001
fe008|if you|D|Btr001
fe008|so it's like ha ha ha.|S|Btr001
fe008|uh.|S|Btr001
fe008|i mean|F|Btr001
fe008|do you have you run across this?|Q|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|and it's like to me i i think i've heard comedians do that.|S|Btr001
fe008|there's there's something there about|D|Btr001
fe008|you know you you make a joke.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then you have an uh in there somehow.|S|Btr001
fe008|which i don't really understand the function of.|S|Btr001
fe066|maybe it's like saying like this is funny.|S|Btr001
fe008|do you|D|Btr001
fe066|but maybe it shouldn't be funny.|S|Btr001
fe066|or this is funny.|S|Btr001
fe066|but maybe it's funny for some sort of perverse reason.|S|Btr001
fe069|or maybe it's just a link to get back to the conversation or something.|S|Btr001
fe068|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|like to connect it with what is going on elsewhere.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|well.|F|Btr001
fe066|so the one i'm thinking of is like if like ha ha.|S|Btr001
fe066|uh you say you would say like um.|S|Btr001
fe066|uh like|D|Btr001
fe066|okay.|F|Btr001
fe066|so he's laughing.|S|Btr001
fe066|ha ha.|S|Btr001
fe066|and then he'd go uh.|S|Btr001
fe069|oh like kind of kind of laughing with it.|S|Btr001
fe066|and|D|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|kind of.|S|Btr001
fe069|in a way.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe066|kind of like uh.|S|Btr001
fe066|you know?|Q|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|and to me that's more of like the maybe this shouldn't be funny.|S|Btr001
fe066|but it is.|S|Btr001
fe066|maybe this is funny because it's kind of disgusting or perverse in some way.|S|Btr001
fe069|huh.|B|Btr001
fe068|huh.|B|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|it's possible.|S|Btr001
fe008|now what i'm thinking|D|Btr001
fe008|i didn't have the extra the extra um what do you say nuances in the uh which you just which you just did.|S|Btr001
fe066|wi|D|Btr001
fe066|oh okay.|S|Btr001
fe008|however the context fits.|S|Btr001
fe008|i mean that's an interesting take on it i think.|S|Btr001
fe069|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|it's possible.|S|Btr001
fe008|it's possible.|S|Btr001
fe066|so you meant just sort of like a just a normal uh?|Q|Btr001
fe008|it's just a normal uh.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|but it's stuck in|D|Btr001
fe008|maybe it's a little louder than usual.|S|Btr001
fe008|it's not any of the extra um you know glottal thing.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|meaning let's keep going?|Q|Btr001
fe069|maybe it means that.|S|Btr001
fe008|well|F|Btr001
fe008|but it just seems like it's more prominent than|D|Btr001
fe008|you know it really is like a placeholder of some sort.|S|Btr001
fe069|uh.|S|Btr001
fe008|like|D|Btr001
fe008|which i think is self reflexive in in the sort of brings focus back onto the jokemaker.|S|Btr001
fe066|that's|D|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|maybe if maybe it's when people don't laugh enough or something.|S|Btr001
fe008|but|D|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah that's possible.|S|Btr001
fe069|i don't know.|F|Btr001
fe066|yeah like let's come back to the original subject.|S|Btr001
fe008|okay.|F|Btr001
fe066|and i will take it from there.|S|Btr001
fe008|oh it could be.|S|Btr001
fe008|yes that's possible.|S|Btr001
fe066|maybe.|S|Btr001
fe008|it's possible.|S|Btr001
fe066|because i've heard um morgan do that.|S|Btr001
fe008|exactly who i was thinking of actually.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|he does that a lot.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah exactly.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|for obvious reasons probably.|S|Btr001
fe066|if that's the way he uses it.|S|Btr001
fe008|that's true.|S|Btr001
fe008|that would the|D|Btr001
fe008|and he does continue after that.|S|Btr001
fe008|but it's just you know to say uh you to say uh while you're laughing it's just to me it's an interesting category.|S|Btr001
me070|right.|B|Btr001
me070|i think it may almost have to do with like okay.|S|Btr001
me070|i told a joke.|S|Btr001
me070|now everyone's laughing.|S|Btr001
me070|and now it's common courtesy i'll sort of tell everyone to stop laughing.|S|Btr001
me070|you know.|F|Btr001
me070|so you don't offend me about how good my joke was.|S|Btr001
me070|you know.|F|Btr001
me070|it's almost like okay.|S|Btr001
me070|uh.|S|Btr001
me070|okay.|S|Btr001
me070|my joke's over.|S|Btr001
me070|you know you can stop laughing now.|S|Btr001
fe069|right.|S|Btr001
fe008|that's possible.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|giving them permission to|D|Btr001
me070|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|you know.|F|Btr001
me070|because it's like how do you you know how much do you laugh after someone's joke?|Q|Btr001
fe068|huh?|Q|Btr001
fe069|i don't know about permission.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|yeah yeah yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|to tell them how much you enjoyed it.|S|Btr001
fe066|be polite or whatever.|S|Btr001
me070|or|F|Btr001
me070|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|or how long do you wait after the joke|D|Btr001
fe069|to keep going with the meeting.|S|Btr001
me070|to|D|Btr001
me070|right.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|very interesting.|S|Btr001
fe008|interesting.|S|Btr001
fe069|because sometimes you can get on digressions that just last for like minutes at a time.|S|Btr001
fe066|right.|S|Btr001
fe008|yes.|S|Btr001
fe069|and people are just hysterical.|S|Btr001
fe069|and they're like what were we talking about.|S|Btr001
fe069|i don't know.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|that's that's|D|Btr001
fe008|huh okay.|B|Btr001
fe069|it's hard when people get really really like into their laughing and start talking at the same time.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe069|it's hard to figure out what they're what they're talking about.|S|Btr001
fe069|and also they don't tend to talk very|D|Btr001
fe069|there's a lot of disfluencies when they're laughing and talking.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr001
me070|definitely.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe069|it's hard to|D|Btr001
me070|sometimes they make me laugh so hard.|S|Btr001
me070|because they'll just be talking about something technical.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
me070|and i'll be so bored.|S|Btr001
me070|and then suddenly they'll say something that they only just sort of chuckle at.|S|Btr001
me070|and then i laugh at for the next like twenty minutes.|S|Btr001
me070|because i think it's so funny.|S|Btr001
me070|like one time everybody was doing the um digits.|S|Btr001
me070|and they were all doing it at the same time.|S|Btr001
me070|and they started off kind of shaky.|S|Btr001
fe068|oh right.|S|Btr001
me070|they were like oh do we want to do this at the same time.|S|Btr001
me070|you know that's you know let's not all start laughing.|S|Btr001
me070|and then they all did it at the same time.|S|Btr001
me070|and one person ended up at the very end doing the digits.|S|Btr001
me070|and everybody had finished.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah!|S|Btr001
me070|and he had like two more lines to go.|S|Btr001
fe066|go|D|Btr001
me070|and when he ended somebody turned to him and went you lose.|S|Btr001
fe008|oh|D|Btr001
me070|and i just kept laughing and laughing and laughing.|S|Btr001
fe066|johno keeps making comments about the transcribers.|S|Btr001
fe008|yes.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|it's the funniest thing.|S|Btr001
fe008|yes.|S|Btr001
fe066|he he'll like|D|Btr001
fe068|what does he say?|Q|Btr001
fe008|he's very funny.|S|Btr001
fe066|say he'll say like mean things about the transcribers.|S|Btr001
fe066|he'll be like|D|Btr001
fe068|why?|Q|Btr001
fe069|oh but i don't mean the transcribers we have here of course.|S|Btr001
me070|oh.|B|Btr001
fe066|like well sometimes he'll do that.|S|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|but sometimes he doesn't.|S|Btr001
fe066|and sometimes he'll just be like uh you know um here transcribers.|S|Btr001
fe066|try transcribing this.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah like when they do random sounds that you have no idea|D|Btr001
fe066|like thanks.|S|Btr001
fe008|he's very funny.|S|Btr001
fe066|right.|B|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|i i started laughing with something he said the other day.|S|Btr001
fe008|it was it was the beginning of a meeting.|S|Btr001
fe008|and it hadn't gotten far into it.|S|Btr001
fe008|and|D|Btr001
fe008|and he's he's doing this one of these mock fights with nancy.|S|Btr001
fe008|which he does.|S|Btr001
fe008|have you run across these mock fights?|Q|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|and he he says um something like|D|Btr001
fe008|uh|F|Btr001
fe008|i and he's they they have this nice mutual condescending joking thing going on.|S|Btr001
fe008|and he says well i could explain this to you.|S|Btr001
fe008|i have a better laugh than you do.|S|Btr001
fe008|the transcribers told me so.|S|Btr001
fe008|and it went on a little longer.|S|Btr001
fe008|but it's it's like this really|D|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe008|and then at one point she you know at another meeting she she was not sure which channel she was on.|S|Btr001
fe008|and he said well i think you're on channel so-and-so.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then she said well no.|S|Btr001
fe008|shouldn't it be channel so-and-so.|S|Btr001
fe008|and he says well no.|S|Btr001
fe008|it should be channel so-and-so.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then it turned out it was channel so-and-so.|S|Btr001
fe008|which he said.|S|Btr001
fe008|and and she said he he said i bested you again nancy.|S|Btr001
fe008|and she said yes.|S|Btr001
fe008|that's my recollection of all of our meetings together.|S|Btr001
fe069|oh my god!|D|Btr001
fe068|oh no.|S|Btr001
fe008|they have this really nice|D|Btr001
fe008|you know it's really|D|Btr001
fe008|those sorts of things it's true.|S|Btr001
fe008|you know it's like it really does liven things up to have the uh the nice interrelationships.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|i think|D|Btr001
fe008|i i found that's a nice aspect of a lot of these meetings.|S|Btr001
fe008|the uh the uh uh little periods of humor like that.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|all right.|F|Btr001
fe008|well so do we would would we could do digits if we so desired.|S|Btr001
fe008|if if we wanted to do that.|S|Btr001
fe068|woo hoo!|S|Btr001
fe066|uh the digits task.|S|Btr001
fe068|let's do simultaneous digits.|S|Btr001
fe068|no let's let's not.|S|Btr001
fe008|let's do simultaneous digits.|S|Btr001
fe066|we|D|Btr001
fe066|can somebody explain to me why you do digits?|Q|Btr001
fe068|no no let's not.|S|Btr001
fe008|no you don't?|Q|Btr001
fe066|i still don't really know.|S|Btr001
fe008|okay the idea is that you have then um you have ground truth.|S|Btr001
fe008|you know exactly what they're supposed to have said.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then of course sometimes we go through and actually um people do double check that they read them correctly and all.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|so that we're sure.|S|Btr001
fe008|as you've done.|S|Btr001
fe068|i remember i did that a little bit.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah i did that once too.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|and yeah you must have too.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|and you did also?|Q|Btr001
fe067|we we are meant to be transcribing if they're just left in the the curly brackets?|Q|Btr001
fe068|kind of early on.|D|Btr001
fe008|no.|S|Btr001
fe008|because it's it's it should be able to be taken care of efficiently with this interface.|S|Btr001
fe008|i mean if the tigerfish people do it then you know leave it.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah they do write the numbers in.|S|Btr001
fe069|the|D|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|that's fine.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah i've been just leaving it.|S|Btr001
fe067|and sometimes they don't.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|F|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe066|oh i've been writing the numbers just because i wasn't sure what to do.|S|Btr001
fe008|sometimes they don't.|S|Btr001
fe008|well if you do that's that's all right as well.|S|Btr001
me070|oh really?|Q|Btr001
fe066|you don't have to?|Q|Btr001
fe008|you don't have to.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh okay.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|because uh we're we have the assumption that we'll take care of it this in this other way.|S|Btr001
fe008|but in any case the idea is that you have ground truth.|S|Btr001
fe067|oh.|B|Btr001
fe008|you know exactly what the person should have said.|S|Btr001
fe008|and you check to be sure.|S|Btr001
fe008|and usually there aren't many errors uh when they were checked.|S|Btr001
fe008|um and then you have this multiplicity of voices uh reading these things.|S|Btr001
fe008|and you can do really good speech recognition that way.|S|Btr001
fe008|so they have some papers out that they've done this.|S|Btr001
fe008|it's really it's been very fruitful in terms of the analyses.|S|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|it's nice to have you know a standard.|S|Btr001
fe008|uh you know it's like uh psychological approach also that you like to have some standard stimulus here.|S|Btr001
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe068|oh yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then you can|D|Btr001
fe068|no i totally agree.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|i i agree.|S|Btr001
fe008|i think it's a nice it's a nice design feature.|S|Btr001
fe066|where's the little things that's supposed to say transcript l dash blah blah blah?|Q|Btr001
fe068|oh it's at the top.|S|Btr001
fe008|yes you run across that.|S|Btr001
fe008|let's see.|F|Btr001
fe008|i guess it would be|D|Btr001
fe008|it's up there.|S|Btr001
me070|it's right here.|S|Btr001
fe067|oh i see.|S|Btr001
me070|yeah i looked for that too.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|up there at the top.|S|Btr001
fe066|uh oh.|S|Btr001
fe066|okay.|S|Btr001
fe069|okay.|B|Btr001
fe068|so i have a question.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe068|because now i'm looking at this and i realize i don't know the answer.|S|Btr001
fe068|is|D|Btr001
fe068|um|F|Btr001
fe068|sometimes when people are reading zero they say o.|S|Btr001
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|yes.|B|Btr001
fe067|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe068|and sometimes they say zero.|S|Btr001
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe068|but|D|Btr001
fe068|and i thought that there must be an indication here.|S|Btr001
fe008|used to be.|S|Btr001
fe069|that's what i thought too.|S|Btr001
fe008|used to be.|S|Btr001
fe068|oh.|S|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe068|that read o or read zero.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh.|S|Btr001
fe008|this they changed them.|S|Btr001
fe008|initially it was words all spelled out.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|so o n e.|S|Btr001
fe066|oh.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe068|oh my!|S|Btr001
fe008|yes.|S|Btr001
me070|oh wow.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr001
fe008|and that was like a stroop test in some ways.|S|Btr001
fe008|it took a lot of|D|Btr001
fe008|when i was doing those i had to really concentrate.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|it was like one seven.|S|Btr001
fe008|you know it was like you really had to let's see the words and the numbers.|S|Btr001
fe068|yeah you're not used to seeing the numbers like that.|S|Btr001
fe008|and|D|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe008|and then you'd have an o h periodically.|S|Btr001
fe008|and um they were initially spelled out that way.|S|Btr001
me070|huh.|B|Btr001
fe066|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|one or the other.|S|Btr001
fe068|i see.|S|Btr001
fe068|so that's why.|S|Btr001
fe008|but we converted them to this format.|S|Btr001
fe008|and then the idea|D|Btr001
fe008|i mean you could conceivably put an o h or a zero for the o s and still have this benefit.|S|Btr001
fe008|but i think that the idea is that people can choose what they think is most natural for them to say in those those locations.|S|Btr001
me070|right.|B|Btr001
fe008|and you know maybe there'd be|D|Btr001
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe068|so it's optional?|Q|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe068|you can say one or the other?|Q|Btr001
fe008|yes.|S|Btr001
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Btr001
fe068|okay.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|so um|F|Btr001
fe067|oh can i ask also?|Q|Btr001
fe008|sure.|S|Btr001
fe067|um it says it looks like the groupings are important.|S|Btr001
fe067|but some of the transcripts i've seen they don't have any commas or breaks.|S|Btr001
fe067|it's just a string of numbers.|S|Btr001
fe067|so we should be adding the breaks if|D|Btr001
fe008|yes.|S|Btr001
fe008|well see uh also this has been a a change in the procedure that used to be that they were like uh one long string.|S|Btr001
fe067|oh okay.|S|Btr001
fe008|different sized strings.|S|Btr001
fe008|but to have them broken up like this it's it's been about uh maybe half a year that that this or maybe maybe seven months i don't know maybe longer that they've gotten actually broken up within the line.|S|Btr001
fe067|huh.|B|Btr001
fe008|so the idea is to pause when you see that.|S|Btr001
fe069|but in the transcriptions i mean we don't have to deal with that.|S|Btr001
fe069|because when the other interface deals with it then they break it up or whatever.|S|Btr001
fe008|no.|S|Btr001
fe008|that's right.|S|Btr001
fe008|break it up more finely.|S|Btr001
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr001
fe067|but if you can clearly hear pauses and there've not been transcribed we should be adding the commas or not?|Q|Btr001
fe067|though the one i'm working on now is like that.|S|Btr001
fe008|well|F|Btr001
fe008|i would say don't worry about that.|S|Btr001
fe008|because um this is|D|Btr001
fe067|okay.|B|Btr001
fe008|again you know it it'd be nice to get the words right.|S|Btr001
fe008|but um|F|Btr001
fe008|the uh the interface that these guys used uh allows you to set the time boundaries really accurately.|S|Btr001
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|so it's not so important.|S|Btr001
fe008|it's more important to focus on the words.|S|Btr001
fe008|because there we don't know the ground truth.|S|Btr001
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr001
fe008|so|F|Btr001
fe008|okay so|F|Btr001
fe069|are we going to do them together then?|Q|Btr001
fe069|or no?|Q|Btr001
fe008|well i don't know.|S|Btr001
fe008|how do you feel?|Q|Btr001
fe068|yeah i don't care.|S|Btr001
fe008|i mean|D|Btr001
fe008|what we could do is we could do it together one week.|S|Btr001
