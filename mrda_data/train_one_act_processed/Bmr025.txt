me013|um so|F|Bmr025
me013|if we can't we can't but uh we're going to try to make this an abbreviated meeting.|S|Bmr025
me013|because the the next next occupants were pushing for it.|S|Bmr025
me013|so|F|Bmr025
me013|um.|F|Bmr025
me013|so|F|Bmr025
me013|agenda is according to this is transcription status darpa demos x m l tools disks backups et cetera and crosspads.|S|Bmr025
me011|does anyone have anything to add to the agenda?|Q|Bmr025
me013|okay.|S|Bmr025
me013|should we just go in order?|Q|Bmr025
me013|transcription status.|S|Bmr025
me013|who's that's probably you.|S|Bmr025
fe008|i can do that quickly.|S|Bmr025
fe008|um i hired several more transcribers.|S|Bmr025
fe008|they're making great progress.|S|Bmr025
me013|seven?|Q|Bmr025
fe008|several several.|S|Bmr025
me013|oh.|S|Bmr025
fe008|and uh|F|Bmr025
fe008|and uh|F|Bmr025
fe008|uh i've been uh finishing up the uh double checking.|S|Bmr025
fe008|i hoped to have had that done by today.|S|Bmr025
fe008|but it's going to take one more week.|S|Bmr025
me011|um|F|Bmr025
me011|as a somewhat segue into the next topic um could i get a hold of uh the data even if it's not really corrected yet?|Q|Bmr025
mn014|i|D|Bmr025
me011|just so i can get the data formats.|S|Bmr025
me011|and make sure the information retrieval stuff is working.|S|Bmr025
fe008|certainly.|S|Bmr025
fe008|yeah i mean it's in the same place it's been.|S|Bmr025
me011|so can you just|D|Bmr025
me011|oh it is?|Q|Bmr025
me011|okay.|S|Bmr025
fe008|uhhuh no change.|S|Bmr025
me011|just so transcripts is the sub directory?|Q|Bmr025
fe008|uh yes uhhuh.|S|Bmr025
me011|okay.|S|Bmr025
me011|so i'll i'll probably just make some copies of those.|S|Bmr025
me011|rather than use the ones that are there.|S|Bmr025
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr025
me011|um and then just we'll have to remember to delete them once the corrections are made.|S|Bmr025
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr025
me013|okay|D|Bmr025
mn014|i also got a short remark to the transcription.|S|Bmr025
mn014|i've uh just processed the first five e d u meetings.|S|Bmr025
mn014|and they are chunked up.|S|Bmr025
mn014|so they would they probably can be sent to i b m.|S|Bmr025
mn014|whenever they want them.|S|Bmr025
me018|well the second one of those|D|Bmr025
me001|cool.|S|Bmr025
mn014|yep it's already at i b m.|S|Bmr025
me018|is already at i b m.|S|Bmr025
mn014|but the other ones|D|Bmr025
me018|that's the one that we're waiting to hear from them on.|S|Bmr025
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr025
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr025
fe008|okay.|B|Bmr025
fe008|these are separate from the ones that|D|Bmr025
me018|as soon as|D|Bmr025
fe008|i mean these are|D|Bmr025
me018|they're the i b m set.|S|Bmr025
me011|it's this one.|D|Bmr025
mn014|yep.|S|Bmr025
fe008|excellent.|B|Bmr025
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr025
fe008|good.|B|Bmr025
me011|is my mike on?|Q|Bmr025
me018|and so as soon as we hear from brian that this one is okay.|S|Bmr025
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me018|and we get the transcript back.|S|Bmr025
me018|and we find out that hopefully there are no problems matching up the transcript with what we gave them.|S|Bmr025
me018|then uh we'll be ready to go and we'll just send them the next four as a big batch.|S|Bmr025
fe008|excellent.|B|Bmr025
me018|and let them work on that.|S|Bmr025
me011|and so we're doing those as disjoint from the ones we're transcribing here?|Q|Bmr025
me018|yes.|S|Bmr025
me011|okay good.|S|Bmr025
me018|exactly.|S|Bmr025
me018|we're sort of doing things in parallel.|S|Bmr025
me018|that way we can get as much done at once.|S|Bmr025
me011|yeah i think that's the right way to do it.|S|Bmr025
me018|yeah.|S|Bmr025
me011|especially for the information retrieval stuff.|S|Bmr025
me011|anything else on transcription status?|Q|Bmr025
fe008|hm-huh.|S|Bmr025
me011|okay.|S|Bmr025
me013|darpa demos.|S|Bmr025
me013|we had the submeeting the other day.|S|Bmr025
me011|right which uh|D|Bmr025
me011|so i've been working on using the thisl tools to do information retrieval on meeting data.|S|Bmr025
me011|and the thisl tools are there're two sets there's a back end and a front end.|S|Bmr025
me011|so the front end is the user interface.|S|Bmr025
me011|and the back end is the indexing tool and the querying tool.|S|Bmr025
me011|and so i've written some tools to convert everything into the right file formats.|S|Bmr025
me011|and the command line version of the indexing and the querying is now working.|S|Bmr025
me011|so at least on the one meeting that i had the transcript for uh conveniently you can now do information retrieval on it.|S|Bmr025
me011|do type in a a string and get back a list of start end times for the meeting.|S|Bmr025
me011|uh of hits.|S|Bmr025
me018|what what kind of uh what does that look like the string that you type in?|Q|Bmr025
me018|what are you are you are they keywords or are they|D|Bmr025
me011|keywords.|S|Bmr025
me018|okay.|S|Bmr025
me018|i see.|S|Bmr025
me011|right and so and then it munges it to pass it to the thisl i r which uses an s g m l like format for everything.|S|Bmr025
me018|i see.|S|Bmr025
me013|and then does it play something back?|Q|Bmr025
me013|or that's something you're having to program?|Q|Bmr025
me011|um right now i have a tool that will do that on a command line using our standard tools.|S|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me011|but my intention is to do a prettier user interface based either|D|Bmr025
me011|so so that's the other thing i wanted to discuss is well what should we do for the user interface.|S|Bmr025
me011|we have two tools that have already been written.|S|Bmr025
me011|um the softsound guys did a web based one.|S|Bmr025
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr025
me011|um which i haven't used haven't looked at.|S|Bmr025
me011|dan says it's pretty good.|S|Bmr025
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr025
me011|but it does mean you need to be running a web server.|S|Bmr025
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr025
me011|and so it it's pretty big and complex.|S|Bmr025
me011|uh and it would be difficult to port to windows.|S|Bmr025
me011|because it means porting the web server to windows.|S|Bmr025
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr025
me011|uh the other option is dan did the tcl t k thisl gui front end for broadcast news.|S|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me011|which i think looks great.|S|Bmr025
me011|i think that's a nice demo.|S|Bmr025
me011|um and that would be much easier to port to windows.|S|Bmr025
me011|and so i think that's the way we should go.|S|Bmr025
fe008|i can i ask a question?|Q|Bmr025
me011|uhhuh.|S|Bmr025
fe008|so um as it stands within the the channeltrans interface it's possible to do a find and a play.|S|Bmr025
fe008|you can find a searched string and play.|S|Bmr025
fe008|so are you so you're adding like um i don't know uh are they fuzzy matches or are they uh|D|Bmr025
me011|it's a sort of standard text-retrieval-based.|S|Bmr025
me011|so it's uh term frequency inverse document frequency scoring.|S|Bmr025
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr025
me011|um and then there are all sorts of metrics for spacing.|S|Bmr025
me011|how far apart they have to be and things like that.|S|Bmr025
me011|so it it's|D|Bmr025
fe008|it's a lot more sophisticated than the uh the basically windows based.|S|Bmr025
me011|it's like doing a google query or anything else like that.|S|Bmr025
me011|so it uses so it produces an index ahead of time.|S|Bmr025
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr025
me011|so you don't you're not doing a linear search through all the documents.|S|Bmr025
me011|because you can imagine if with if we have the sixty hours' worth you do wouldn't want to do a search.|S|Bmr025
fe008|hm-huh.|S|Bmr025
me011|um you have to do preindexing.|S|Bmr025
fe008|good.|B|Bmr025
me011|and so that these tools do all that.|S|Bmr025
me011|and so the work to get the front end to work would be porting it|D|Bmr025
me011|well uh to get it to work on the unix systems our side is just rewriting them and modifying them to work for meetings.|S|Bmr025
me011|so that it understands that they're different speakers and that it's one big audio file instead of a bunch of little ones and just sort of things like that.|S|Bmr025
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr025
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr025
fe016|uhhuh.|B|Bmr025
me018|so what does the user see as the result of the query?|Q|Bmr025
me011|on which tool?|Q|Bmr025
me018|thisl.|S|Bmr025
me011|the thisl gui tool which is the one that dan wrote tcl t k.|S|Bmr025
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me011|um you type in a query and then you get back a list of hits.|S|Bmr025
me011|and you can type on them and listen to them.|S|Bmr025
me011|click on them rather with a mouse.|S|Bmr025
me018|uh.|S|Bmr025
me018|so if you typed in small heads or something you could|Q|Bmr025
me013|huh.|B|Bmr025
me011|right you'd get|D|Bmr025
me018|get back a uh uh something that would let you click and listen to some audio where that phrase had occurred.|S|Bmr025
me011|something|D|Bmr025
me011|you you'd get to listen to beep.|S|Bmr025
me018|or|D|Bmr025
me013|that was a really good look.|S|Bmr025
me013|it's too bad that that couldn't come into the|D|Bmr025
me011|you couldn't get a video.|S|Bmr025
fe016|guess who i practice on.|S|Bmr025
fe008|at some point we're going to have to say what that private joke is.|S|Bmr025
fe008|that keeps coming up.|S|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr025
me013|and then again maybe not.|S|Bmr025
me013|so uh|F|Bmr025
me013|yeah that that sounds reasonable.|S|Bmr025
me013|yeah it it my my recollection of it is it's it's a pretty reasonable uh demo sort of format.|S|Bmr025
me011|right.|S|Bmr025
me018|yeah that sounds good.|S|Bmr025
me011|and so i think there'd be minimal effort to get it to work minimally.|S|Bmr025
me018|that sounds really neat.|S|Bmr025
me011|and then we'd want to add things like query by speaker and by meeting and all that sort of stuff.|S|Bmr025
me011|um dave gelbart expressed some interest in working on that.|S|Bmr025
me011|so i'll work with him on it.|S|Bmr025
me011|and it it's looking pretty good.|S|Bmr025
me011|you know the fact that i got the query system working.|S|Bmr025
me011|so if we want to just do a video based one i think that'll be easy.|S|Bmr025
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr025
me011|if we want to get it to windows it's going to be a little more work.|S|Bmr025
me011|because the thisl i r the information retrieval tool's um|D|Bmr025
me011|i had difficulty just compiling them on solaris.|S|Bmr025
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr025
me011|so getting them to compile on windows might be challenging.|S|Bmr025
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr025
me018|but you were saying that that the uh that there's that set of tools uh cygnus tools that|D|Bmr025
me011|so|F|Bmr025
me011|it certainly helps.|S|Bmr025
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr025
me011|um i mean without those i wouldn't even attempt it.|S|Bmr025
me018|yeah.|S|Bmr025
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr025
me011|but what those they what those do is provide sort of a b s d compatibility layer.|S|Bmr025
me011|so that the normal unix function calls all work.|S|Bmr025
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr025
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr025
me011|um|F|Bmr025
me018|and you have to have all the|D|Bmr025
me011|but the problem is that that the thisl tools didn't use anything like autoconf.|S|Bmr025
me011|and so you have the normal porting problems of different header files and some things are defined and some things aren't.|S|Bmr025
me011|and uh different compiler work arounds and so on.|S|Bmr025
me011|so the fact that um it took me a day to get it to compile under solaris means it's probably going to take me significantly more than that to get it to compile under windows.|S|Bmr025
me013|how about having it run under free b s d?|Q|Bmr025
me022|well what you need|D|Bmr025
me011|free b s d would probably be easier.|S|Bmr025
me022|all you need to do is say to dan gee it would be nice if this worked under autoconf and it'll be done in a day.|S|Bmr025
me011|that's true.|S|Bmr025
me022|right?|Q|Bmr025
mn014|uh|B|Bmr025
me011|actually you know i should check.|S|Bmr025
me011|because he did port it to sprachcore.|S|Bmr025
me022|right.|S|Bmr025
me011|so he might have done that already.|S|Bmr025
me022|i i i wouldn't be surprised.|S|Bmr025
me013|so|F|Bmr025
me011|i'll check at that.|S|Bmr025
me018|how does it play?|Q|Bmr025
me022|what i|D|Bmr025
me013|but it would what would serve would serve both purposes is if you contact him and ask him if he's already done it.|S|Bmr025
me011|yeah right.|S|Bmr025
me013|if he has then you learn.|S|Bmr025
me013|if he hasn't then he'll do it.|S|Bmr025
me011|right.|S|Bmr025
fe008|wow.|B|Bmr025
me018|i hope he never listens to these meetings.|S|Bmr025
me011|that's right.|D|Bmr025
me011|so and i've been corresponding with dan and also with uh uh softsound guy uh|D|Bmr025
fe008|it's amazing.|B|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me011|blanking on his name.|S|Bmr025
me018|tony robinson?|Q|Bmr025
me013|tony robinson?|Q|Bmr025
me011|do i mean tony?|Q|Bmr025
me011|i guess i do.|S|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me011|or or steve renals.|S|Bmr025
me022|james christie.|S|Bmr025
me011|which one do i mean?|Q|Bmr025
me013|steve steve renals.|S|Bmr025
me022|steve renals is not softsound.|S|Bmr025
me022|is he?|Q|Bmr025
me013|no.|S|Bmr025
me011|my brain is not working.|S|Bmr025
me011|i don't remember who i've been corresponding with.|S|Bmr025
me013|okay.|S|Bmr025
me022|steve it's steve renals wrote thisl i r.|S|Bmr025
me011|then it's steve renals.|S|Bmr025
me022|okay.|S|Bmr025
me013|oh okay.|S|Bmr025
me011|so uh just getting documentation and uh and and formats.|S|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me011|so that's all going pretty well.|S|Bmr025
me011|i think we'll be okay with that.|S|Bmr025
me022|right.|B|Bmr025
me013|assuming we're|D|Bmr025
me018|what about issues of playing sound files between the two platforms?|Q|Bmr025
me011|um|F|Bmr025
me011|we have|D|Bmr025
me011|well that's a good point too.|S|Bmr025
me022|here's a here's a crazy idea actually.|S|Bmr025
me011|i don't know.|S|Bmr025
me022|why don't you try and merge transcriber and thisl i r?|Q|Bmr025
me011|well this is one of the reasons|D|Bmr025
me022|they're both tcl interfaces.|S|Bmr025
me011|this is the one of the reasons that i'm going to have uh dave gelbart gelbart.|S|Bmr025
me011|having him volunteer to work on it is a really good thing.|S|Bmr025
me011|because he's worked on the transcriber stuff.|S|Bmr025
me022|right.|S|Bmr025
me011|and he's more familiar with tcl t k than i am.|S|Bmr025
me022|and then you get they then you get the windows media playing for free.|S|Bmr025
me011|well that's snack not not transcriber.|S|Bmr025
me022|right but the point is that the transcriber uses snack and then you can but you can use a a lot of the same functionality.|S|Bmr025
me011|yeah yeah i mean i i think thisl thisl gui probably uses snack.|S|Bmr025
me022|and it's|D|Bmr025
me011|and so my intention was just to base it on that.|S|Bmr025
me022|yeah.|S|Bmr025
me022|well my thought was is that it would be nice it would be nice to have the running transcripts um uh you know from speaker to speaker.|S|Bmr025
me011|and if it doesn't|D|Bmr025
me022|right?|Q|Bmr025
me022|do you have you have you know a speaker mark here and a speaker mark here?|Q|Bmr025
me011|right we'll have to figure out a user interface for that so.|S|Bmr025
me022|right well that uh my thought was if you had like multitrans or whatever do it.|S|Bmr025
me022|or whatever.|S|Bmr025
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr025
me011|it might be fairly difficult to get that to work in the little short segments we'd be talking about.|S|Bmr025
me011|and having the search tools and so on.|S|Bmr025
me011|we we can look into it.|S|Bmr025
me011|but|F|Bmr025
me022|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me013|the thing i was asking about with um free b s d is that it might be easier to|D|Bmr025
me013|get powerpoint shows running in free b s d than to get this other package running in|D|Bmr025
me011|yeah i mean we have to i have to sit down and try it before i make too many judgments.|S|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me011|so uh|F|Bmr025
me011|um|F|Bmr025
me011|my experience with the gnu compatibility library is really it's just as hard and just as easy to port to any system.|S|Bmr025
me011|right?|Q|Bmr025
me011|the windows system isn't any harder.|S|Bmr025
me011|because it it looks like a b s d system.|S|Bmr025
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr025
me011|it's just you know just like all of them the include files are a little different and the function calls are a little different.|S|Bmr025
me013|right.|B|Bmr025
me011|so i it might be a little easier.|S|Bmr025
me011|but it's not going to be a lot easier.|S|Bmr025
me013|okay.|B|Bmr025
me013|so there was that demo which was one of the main ones.|S|Bmr025
me013|and then we talked about um some other stuff.|S|Bmr025
me013|which would basically be um showing off the the transcriber interface itself.|S|Bmr025
me013|and as you say maybe we could even merge those in some sense.|S|Bmr025
me013|but but um|F|Bmr025
me013|uh and part of that was showing off what the speech non uh nonspeech stuff that thilo has done looks like.|S|Bmr025
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr025
fe008|can i ask one more thing about thisl?|Q|Bmr025
me011|uhhuh.|S|Bmr025
fe008|so with the i r stuff then you end up with a somewhat prioritized um|D|Bmr025
me011|uhhuh.|S|Bmr025
me011|ranked.|S|Bmr025
fe008|excellent.|S|Bmr025
fe008|excellent.|S|Bmr025
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr025
fe016|so another idea i had just now actually for the demo was whether it might be of interest to to show some of the prosody uh work that don's been doing.|S|Bmr025
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr025
fe016|um actually show some of the features.|S|Bmr025
fe016|and then show for instance a task like finding sentence boundaries or finding turn boundaries.|S|Bmr025
fe016|um|F|Bmr025
fe016|you know you can show that graphically sort of what the features are doing.|S|Bmr025
fe016|it you know it doesn't work great but it's definitely giving us something.|S|Bmr025
me013|well i think it|D|Bmr025
fe016|i don't know if that would be of interest or not.|S|Bmr025
me013|at the very least we're going to want something illustrative with that.|S|Bmr025
me013|because i'm going to want to talk about it.|S|Bmr025
me013|and so if there's something that shows it graphically it's much better than me just having a bullet point.|S|Bmr025
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me013|pointing at something i don't know much about.|S|Bmr025
fe016|i mean you're looking at this now.|S|Bmr025
me013|so|F|Bmr025
fe016|are you looking at waves or matlab?|Q|Bmr025
me001|um yeah i'm starting to.|S|Bmr025
me001|and|F|Bmr025
me001|um|F|Bmr025
me001|yeah we can probably find some examples of different type of prosodic events going on.|S|Bmr025
fe016|yeah|D|Bmr025
me013|so when we here were having this demo meeting what we're sort of coming up with is that we want to have all these pieces together to first order by the end of the month.|S|Bmr025
me013|and then that'll give us a week or so.|S|Bmr025
fe016|oh the end of this month or next month?|Q|Bmr025
me001|ooo the end of|D|Bmr025
me011|this month.|S|Bmr025
fe016|oh you mean like today?|S|Bmr025
fe016|oh.|S|Bmr025
me011|oh sorry next month.|S|Bmr025
me013|june june june.|S|Bmr025
fe016|next month.|S|Bmr025
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr025
fe016|sorry.|S|Bmr025
me011|today isn't june first.|S|Bmr025
me018|there's another one.|S|Bmr025
me011|is it?|Q|Bmr025
me022|exactly.|B|Bmr025
me013|uh that'll that'll give us that'll give us a week or so to uh to port things over to my laptop and make sure that works.|S|Bmr025
fe016|sorry.|S|Bmr025
fe016|i think i mean uh where|D|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me001|yeah i mean i'll be here.|S|Bmr025
fe016|yeah if if don can sort of talk to whoever's|D|Bmr025
fe016|because we're doing this anyway as part of our you know the research.|S|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
fe016|visualizing what these features are doing.|S|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
fe016|and so either|D|Bmr025
fe016|it might not be integrated.|S|Bmr025
fe016|but it it could potentially be in it.|S|Bmr025
fe016|could find some.|S|Bmr025
me013|yeah well this is to an audience of researchers.|S|Bmr025
me013|so i mean you know|D|Bmr025
me013|to let the goal is to let them know what it is we're doing.|S|Bmr025
fe016|i mean it's different.|S|Bmr025
me013|so that's|D|Bmr025
fe016|i don't think anyone has done this on meeting data.|S|Bmr025
fe016|so it might be neat you know.|S|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me013|good.|B|Bmr025
me013|done with that.|S|Bmr025
me013|x m l tools?|Q|Bmr025
me011|um|F|Bmr025
me011|so i've been doing a bunch of x m l tools.|S|Bmr025
me011|where you we're sort of moving to x m l as the general format for everything.|S|Bmr025
me011|and i think that's definitely the right way to go.|S|Bmr025
me011|because there are a lot of tools that let you do extraction and reformatting of x m l tools.|S|Bmr025
me011|um|F|Bmr025
me011|so yet again we should probably meet to talk about transcription formats in x m l.|S|Bmr025
me011|because i'm not particularly happy with what we have now.|S|Bmr025
me011|i mean it works with transcriber.|S|Bmr025
me011|but it it's a pain to use it in other tools.|S|Bmr025
me011|uh because it doesn't mark start and end.|S|Bmr025
me018|start and end of each|D|Bmr025
me011|uh|F|Bmr025
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me011|utterance.|S|Bmr025
me018|utterance.|S|Bmr025
me018|just marks?|Q|Bmr025
me011|so it's implicit in in there.|S|Bmr025
me011|but you have to do a lot of processing to get it.|S|Bmr025
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me018|right.|S|Bmr025
me018|right.|S|Bmr025
me011|and so and also i'd like to do the indirect time line business.|S|Bmr025
me011|um but regardless i mean that's something that you me and jane can talk about later.|S|Bmr025
me011|um but i've installed x m l tools of various sorts in various languages.|S|Bmr025
me011|and so if people are interested in doing extracting any information from any of these files.|S|Bmr025
me011|either uh information on users because the user database is that way.|S|Bmr025
me011|i'm converting the key files to x m l so that you can extract uh various uh sorted information on individual meetings.|S|Bmr025
me001|cool.|S|Bmr025
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me011|and then also the transcripts.|S|Bmr025
me011|and so just let me know there.|S|Bmr025
me011|it's mostly java and perl.|S|Bmr025
me011|but we can get other languages too if if that's desirable.|S|Bmr025
fe016|oh quick question on that is do we have the the seat information?|Q|Bmr025
fe016|in in the key files now?|Q|Bmr025
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Bmr025
me011|the seat information is on the key files for the ones which|D|Bmr025
fe008|uh|B|Bmr025
fe016|oh in|D|Bmr025
me011|it's been recorded.|S|Bmr025
fe016|for the new one.|S|Bmr025
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr025
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr025
me013|seat?|Q|Bmr025
fe016|great.|S|Bmr025
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr025
me011|where where you're sitting.|S|Bmr025
me013|oh not not the quality or anything no.|S|Bmr025
me011|right.|S|Bmr025
me013|okay i see.|S|Bmr025
me011|it's pretty soft and squishy.|S|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
fe016|all right.|B|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me013|okay.|F|Bmr025
me011|oh but that might just be me.|S|Bmr025
fe016|okay.|B|Bmr025
me011|um|F|Bmr025
fe016|all right.|B|Bmr025
me013|that's more seat information than we wanted.|S|Bmr025
fe016|never mind.|S|Bmr025
me022|huh|B|Bmr025
fe016|i'm just trying to figure out you know when morgan's voice appears on someone's microphone are they next to him or are they across from him.|S|Bmr025
me011|maybe we should bleep that out.|S|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me013|huh yeah.|B|Bmr025
me018|wait a minute.|S|Bmr025
me011|right.|S|Bmr025
me018|how how uh where is it in the key file?|Q|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me011|the square bracket.|S|Bmr025
fe016|because i mean i haven't been putting it in.|S|Bmr025
fe016|and in by|D|Bmr025
me011|you haven't been putting it in.|S|Bmr025
fe016|right.|S|Bmr025
fe016|i have not.|S|Bmr025
fe008|well|D|Bmr025
me011|oh okay.|S|Bmr025
fe008|isn't it always on the digits?|Q|Bmr025
fe016|and|F|Bmr025
me013|some of these are missing.|S|Bmr025
me013|aren't they?|Q|Bmr025
fe008|isn't it always on the digits forms?|Q|Bmr025
me013|some fall out of|D|Bmr025
fe016|well|D|Bmr025
me011|yeah so we can go back and fill them in for the ones we have.|S|Bmr025
me001|ooo.|B|Bmr025
fe016|i mean they're on right these.|S|Bmr025
fe016|but i just hadn't ever been putting it in the key files.|S|Bmr025
me018|yeah i i never|D|Bmr025
fe016|and i don't think chuck was either.|S|Bmr025
me018|i never knew we were supposed to put it in the key file.|S|Bmr025
fe016|because|D|Bmr025
me011|i had told you guys about it.|S|Bmr025
fe016|oh so we're both sorry.|S|Bmr025
me011|but|F|Bmr025
me018|oh really?|Q|Bmr025
fe016|so|F|Bmr025
me011|i mean this is why i want to use a a tool to do it rather than the plain text.|S|Bmr025
fe016|okay.|B|Bmr025
me011|because with the plain text it's very easy to skip those things.|S|Bmr025
me018|okay.|S|Bmr025
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr025
me011|so|F|Bmr025
me011|um if you use the edit key|D|Bmr025
me011|or key edit.|S|Bmr025
me011|i think it's edit key command.|S|Bmr025
mn014|edit key.|S|Bmr025
me011|did i show you guys that?|Q|Bmr025
mn014|yep.|S|Bmr025
me011|i did show it to you.|S|Bmr025
me018|you mentioned it.|S|Bmr025
me011|but i think you both said no you'll just use text file.|S|Bmr025
me018|yeah yeah.|S|Bmr025
me018|text.|S|Bmr025
me011|um it has it in there a place to fill it in.|S|Bmr025
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr025
me018|okay.|S|Bmr025
me011|yeah and so if you don't fill it in you're not going to get it in the meetings.|S|Bmr025
fe016|so if|D|Bmr025
me011|so|F|Bmr025
fe016|right well i i just realized i hadn't been doing it.|S|Bmr025
me011|yep.|B|Bmr025
fe016|and probably so|D|Bmr025
me011|yeah and then the other thing also that thilo noticed is on the microphone.|S|Bmr025
me011|on channel zero it says hand held mike or crown mike.|S|Bmr025
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr025
fe016|right.|S|Bmr025
me011|you actually have to say which one.|S|Bmr025
fe016|i know.|S|Bmr025
fe016|yeah i usually delete the|D|Bmr025
me011|so|F|Bmr025
fe016|i don't|D|Bmr025
me018|oh okay i didn't do that either.|S|Bmr025
fe016|maybe i forgot to|D|Bmr025
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me018|takes me no time at all to edit these.|S|Bmr025
fe016|but it's almost|D|Bmr025
fe016|yeah.|F|Bmr025
me011|yeah that's because you|D|Bmr025
me018|i'm not doing anything.|S|Bmr025
me011|i i know why.|S|Bmr025
fe016|and i was i was looking at chuck's like oh what did chuck do.|S|Bmr025
fe016|okay i'll do that.|S|Bmr025
fe016|so|F|Bmr025
me011|and then uh also in a couple of places instead of filling the participants under participants they were filled in under description.|S|Bmr025
me013|uh okay.|S|Bmr025
fe016|uh|F|Bmr025
me011|and so that's also a problem.|S|Bmr025
me011|so anyway.|S|Bmr025
fe016|we will do better.|S|Bmr025
me011|that's it.|S|Bmr025
me011|oh uh also i'm working on another version of this tool.|S|Bmr025
me011|the the one that shows up here that will flash yellow if the mike isn't connected.|S|Bmr025
me011|and it's not quite ready to go yet.|S|Bmr025
me011|because um it's hard to tell whether the mike's connected or not.|S|Bmr025
me011|because the best quality ones the crown ones are about the same level if they're off.|S|Bmr025
me011|and no one's off or if they're on and no one's talking.|S|Bmr025
me001|huh.|B|Bmr025
me011|um these these ones they are much easier.|S|Bmr025
me011|there's a bigger difference.|S|Bmr025
me011|so i'm working on that.|S|Bmr025
me011|and it it sort of works.|S|Bmr025
me011|and so eventually we will change to that.|S|Bmr025
me011|and then you'll be able to see graphically if your mike is dropping in or out.|S|Bmr025
me001|will that also include like batteries dying?|Q|Bmr025
me011|yep.|S|Bmr025
me001|just any time the mike's putting out zeros basically.|S|Bmr025
me011|yep.|S|Bmr025
me011|yep.|S|Bmr025
me018|but with the screensaver kicking in it|D|Bmr025
me011|now|D|Bmr025
mn014|but|F|Bmr025
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me011|well i'll turn off the screensaver too.|S|Bmr025
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr025
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me001|oops!|S|Bmr025
me011|um the other thing is as i've said before it is actually on.|S|Bmr025
me001|speaking of which.|S|Bmr025
me011|the thing.|S|Bmr025
me011|there's a little level meter.|S|Bmr025
me011|but of course no one ever pays attention to it.|S|Bmr025
me011|so i think having it on the screen is more easy to notice.|S|Bmr025
fe008|it would be nice if if these had little light indicators.|S|Bmr025
fe008|little l e d's for|D|Bmr025
me011|uh buzzer.|S|Bmr025
fe008|yeah a buzzer.|S|Bmr025
me011|bamp bamp!|S|Bmr025
me013|small shocks.|S|Bmr025
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr025
fe008|actually|D|Bmr025
me013|administered to the|D|Bmr025
me013|okay.|F|Bmr025
me011|okay disk backup et cetera?|Q|Bmr025
me013|oh|F|Bmr025
me011|um i spoke with dave johnson about putting all the meeting recorder stuff on non backed up disk to save the overhead of backup.|S|Bmr025
me011|and he pretty much said yeah you could do that if you want.|S|Bmr025
me011|but he thought it was a bad idea.|S|Bmr025
me011|in fact what he said is doing the manual one doing uh n w archive to copy it is a good idea.|S|Bmr025
me011|and we should do that and have it backed up.|S|Bmr025
me011|he he's a firm believer in in lots of different modalities of backup.|S|Bmr025
me011|i mean his point was well taken.|S|Bmr025
me011|this data cannot be recovered.|S|Bmr025
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr025
me011|and so if a mistake is made and we lose the backup we should have the archive.|S|Bmr025
me011|and if then a mistake is made and we lose the archive we should have the backup.|S|Bmr025
me013|well i guess it is true that even with something that's backed up it's not going to|D|Bmr025
me013|if it's stationary it's not going to go through the it's not going to burden things in the incremental backups.|S|Bmr025
me011|just just the monthly full.|S|Bmr025
fe008|huh|B|Bmr025
me013|yeah so the monthly full will be a bear.|S|Bmr025
me013|but|F|Bmr025
me011|yeah but he said that that we shouldn't worry too much about that.|S|Bmr025
me011|that we're getting a new backup system.|S|Bmr025
me011|and we're far enough away from saturation on full backups that it's probably okay.|S|Bmr025
me013|really?|Q|Bmr025
me011|and uh so the only issue here is the timing between getting more disks and uh recording meetings.|S|Bmr025
me013|so i guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non backed up space for things that took less than twenty four hours to recreate or something like that.|S|Bmr025
me011|things that are recreatable easily and also yeah basically things that are recreatable.|S|Bmr025
me013|right?|Q|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me011|the expanded files and things like that.|S|Bmr025
me013|okay.|B|Bmr025
me011|they take up a lot more room anyway.|S|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me011|uh but we do need more disk.|S|Bmr025
me013|so we can get more disk.|S|Bmr025
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr025
me013|yeah so.|F|Bmr025
me011|and i i think i agree with him.|S|Bmr025
me011|i mean his point was well taken that if we lose one of these we cannot get it back.|S|Bmr025
me013|okay.|S|Bmr025
me011|i don't think there was any other et cetera there.|S|Bmr025
me013|well i was allowing someone else to come up with something related that they had uh|D|Bmr025
me022|i thought you guys were going to burn c d's.|S|Bmr025
me011|um unfortunately we could burn c d's but first of all it's a pain.|S|Bmr025
me022|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me011|because you have to copy it down to the p c and then burn it.|S|Bmr025
me011|and that's a multi step procedure.|S|Bmr025
me011|and second of all the the write once burners as opposed to a professional press don't last.|S|Bmr025
me022|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me011|so i think burning them for distribution is fine.|S|Bmr025
me011|but burning them for backup is not a good idea.|S|Bmr025
me022|i see.|S|Bmr025
me011|because they they fail after a couple years.|S|Bmr025
me022|okay.|B|Bmr025
me022|all right.|B|Bmr025
fe008|i do have uh uh it's a different topic can i add one topic.|S|Bmr025
fe008|we have time?|Q|Bmr025
fe008|i wanted to ask|D|Bmr025
fe008|i know that uh that thilo you were um bringing the channeltrans interface onto the windows machine.|S|Bmr025
mn014|yeah it's it basically it's done.|S|Bmr025
fe008|and i wanted to know is|D|Bmr025
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr025
fe008|it's all done that's wonderful great.|S|Bmr025
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me011|yes since tcl t k runs on it basically things will just work.|S|Bmr025
mn014|yeah it|D|Bmr025
mn014|yeah it was just a problem with the snack version and the transcriber version.|S|Bmr025
mn014|but it's solved.|F|Bmr025
mn014|so|F|Bmr025
fe008|does and that does that mean i|D|Bmr025
fe008|maybe i should know this but i don't.|S|Bmr025
fe008|does this mean that the that this could be uh ported to a think pad or some other type of uh|D|Bmr025
mn014|yeah basically uh i did install it on my laptop.|S|Bmr025
mn014|and yeah.|F|Bmr025
fe008|wonderful.|S|Bmr025
mn014|it worked.|S|Bmr025
fe008|wonderful.|S|Bmr025
me013|huh!|B|Bmr025
me013|good.|S|Bmr025
me013|crosspads?|Q|Bmr025
me011|uh i got an email from uh james landay.|S|Bmr025
me011|who basically said if you're not using them could you return them.|S|Bmr025
me011|so he said he doesn't need them he just periodically at the end of each term sends out email to everyone who was recorded as having them.|S|Bmr025
me011|and asks them if they're still using them.|S|Bmr025
me013|so we've never used them.|S|Bmr025
fe008|we used them once.|S|Bmr025
me011|we we used them a couple times.|S|Bmr025
me013|once?|Q|Bmr025
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Bmr025
me018|them?|Q|Bmr025
me011|but|F|Bmr025
fe008|couple times.|S|Bmr025
me018|there's more than one?|Q|Bmr025
me011|yeah we have two.|S|Bmr025
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr025
me011|um|F|Bmr025
me013|but|F|Bmr025
me011|my opinion on it is|D|Bmr025
me011|first i never take notes anyway.|S|Bmr025
me011|so i'm not going to use it.|S|Bmr025
me011|um and second it's another level of infrastructure that we have to deal with.|S|Bmr025
fe008|and i have uh so my my feeling on it is that i think in principle it's a really nice idea.|S|Bmr025
fe008|and you have the time tags which makes it better than just taking raw notes.|S|Bmr025
fe008|on the other hand i the down side for me was that i think the pen is really noisy.|S|Bmr025
fe008|so you have kaplunk kaplunk kaplunk.|S|Bmr025
fe008|and i and i don't know if it's audible on the|D|Bmr025
fe008|but i i sort of thought that was a disadvantage.|S|Bmr025
fe008|i do take notes.|S|Bmr025
fe008|i mean i could be taking notes on these things.|S|Bmr025
fe008|and i guess the plus with the crosspads would be the time markings.|S|Bmr025
fe008|but|F|Bmr025
fe008|i don't know.|S|Bmr025
mn014|uh what is a crosspad?|Q|Bmr025
me013|so it's it's um it's a regular pad just a regular pad of paper but there's this pen which indicates position.|S|Bmr025
me001|thank you.|S|Bmr025
me013|and so you have time and position stuff stored.|S|Bmr025
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr025
me013|so that you can you have a record of whatever it is you've written.|S|Bmr025
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr025
me011|and then you can download it.|S|Bmr025
me011|and they have o c r and searching and all sorts of things.|S|Bmr025
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr025
mn014|okay.|B|Bmr025
me011|so if you take notes it's a great little device.|S|Bmr025
fe008|could uhhuh|D|Bmr025
me011|but i don't take notes.|S|Bmr025
me013|and one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because uh we were interested in in higher level things.|S|Bmr025
me011|so|F|Bmr025
me013|not just the you know microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth.|S|Bmr025
me013|and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what what was it that happened in the meeting you know where would it come from.|S|Bmr025
me013|and um i think that was one of the things.|S|Bmr025
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me011|yep.|S|Bmr025
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr025
me013|right?|Q|Bmr025
me013|and so the it seemed like a neat idea.|S|Bmr025
me013|we'll have a you know have a scribe.|S|Bmr025
me013|have somebody uh take good notes and then that's part of the record of the meeting.|S|Bmr025
me013|and then we did it once or twice and we sort of|D|Bmr025
me011|yep and then just sort of died out.|S|Bmr025
me013|probably chose the wrong scribe.|S|Bmr025
me013|but it was it's uh|D|Bmr025
me011|yeah that's right.|S|Bmr025
fe016|i mean|D|Bmr025
fe008|well i did it one time.|S|Bmr025
fe008|but um|F|Bmr025
me011|yep.|B|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
fe008|but i guess the the other thing i'm thinking is if we wanted that kind of thing i wonder if we'd lose that much by having someone be a scribe.|S|Bmr025
fe008|by listening to the tape to the recording afterwards.|S|Bmr025
fe008|and taking notes in some other interface.|S|Bmr025
me018|i mean we're transcribing it anyways.|S|Bmr025
me018|why do we need notes?|Q|Bmr025
fe008|oh it's it's useful.|S|Bmr025
me011|because that's summary.|S|Bmr025
fe008|have a summary and high points.|S|Bmr025
fe016|i think|D|Bmr025
me013|summary.|S|Bmr025
fe016|there's also|D|Bmr025
fe016|there's this use that|D|Bmr025
me018|summarize it from the transcription.|S|Bmr025
fe016|the|D|Bmr025
fe016|well what if you're sitting there and you just want to make an x?|Q|Bmr025
fe016|and you don't want to take notes.|S|Bmr025
fe016|and you're you just want to|D|Bmr025
me018|doodle.|S|Bmr025
fe016|get the summary of the transcript from this time location.|S|Bmr025
fe016|like you know and and then while you're bored you don't do anything.|S|Bmr025
fe016|and once in a while maybe there's a joke and you put a x.|S|Bmr025
fe016|but|F|Bmr025
fe016|in in other words you can use that just to highlight times in a very simple way.|S|Bmr025
fe016|also with i was thinking and i know morgan disagrees with me on this.|S|Bmr025
fe016|but suppose you have a group in here and you want to let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not want to distribute in terms of content.|S|Bmr025
fe016|they could just sort of make an x near that point.|S|Bmr025
fe016|or a question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they could get some red flags in that transcript region.|S|Bmr025
fe016|and they can then look at it.|S|Bmr025
fe016|so|F|Bmr025
fe016|i know we haven't been using it.|S|Bmr025
fe016|but i i can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods.|S|Bmr025
me011|right.|S|Bmr025
fe016|which you then get back in a transcript.|S|Bmr025
fe008|well.|B|Bmr025
me013|i guess so you know what what makes one think is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later.|S|Bmr025
fe016|so|F|Bmr025
me013|and and and put some kind of summary or something.|S|Bmr025
me013|uh you know some there'd be some scribe who would actually listen who'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing.|S|Bmr025
me013|not transcribe it but just sort of write down things that struck them as important.|S|Bmr025
me013|but then you don't you don't have the time reference uh that you'd have if you had it live.|S|Bmr025
fe016|right.|S|Bmr025
fe016|and you don't have a lot of other cues that might be useful.|S|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr025
me018|how do you synchronize the time in the crosspad and the time of the recording?|Q|Bmr025
fe016|so|F|Bmr025
me011|i mean that was one of the issues we talked about originally.|S|Bmr025
me011|and that's part of the difficulty is that we need an infrastructure for using the time the crosspads.|S|Bmr025
me011|and so that means synchronizing the time|D|Bmr025
fe016|oh.|B|Bmr025
me011|you know you want it pretty close.|S|Bmr025
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr025
me011|and there's a fair amount of skew because it's a hand held unit with a battery.|S|Bmr025
fe008|well when when i|D|Bmr025
me011|and so you|D|Bmr025
fe008|okay.|B|Bmr025
me011|so you have to synchronize at the beginning of each meeting all the pads that are being used.|S|Bmr025
me011|so that it's synchronized with the time on that.|S|Bmr025
me011|and then you have to download to an application.|S|Bmr025
me011|and then you have to figure out what the data formats are and convert it over if you want to do anything with this information.|S|Bmr025
me011|and so there's a lot of infrastructure which|D|Bmr025
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr025
me022|why|D|Bmr025
fe008|there is an alternative.|S|Bmr025
me011|unless someone|D|Bmr025
fe008|there is an alternative.|S|Bmr025
fe008|i mean it's still there's uh you know your point stands about there be needing to be an infrastructure.|S|Bmr025
fe008|but it doesn't have to be synchronized with the little clock's timer on it.|S|Bmr025
fe008|you i mean i when i when i did it i synchronized it by voice.|S|Bmr025
fe008|by whispering one two three four onto the microphone.|S|Bmr025
me011|huh|B|Bmr025
fe008|and uh you know.|S|Bmr025
me011|well but then there's the infrastructure at the other end.|S|Bmr025
me022|right.|B|Bmr025
me011|which someone has to listen to that and find that point.|S|Bmr025
fe008|yeah it's transcribed.|S|Bmr025
me011|and then mark it.|S|Bmr025
fe008|it's in the transcript.|S|Bmr025
me011|so|F|Bmr025
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr025
fe008|well it's in the transcript.|S|Bmr025
fe016|well could we keep one of these things for another year?|Q|Bmr025
fe016|would i mean is there a big|D|Bmr025
me011|we can keep all both of them for the whole whole year.|S|Bmr025
fe016|just just in case we|D|Bmr025
me011|i mean it's just|D|Bmr025
fe016|even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate.|S|Bmr025
fe016|uh just there's a bunch of things that might be neat to do.|S|Bmr025
fe016|but i it might not be the case that we can actually synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure.|S|Bmr025
fe016|but we could at least try it out.|S|Bmr025
me013|well one thing that we might try um is on some set of meetings some collection of meetings maybe e d u is the right one or maybe something else.|S|Bmr025
me013|we we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task.|S|Bmr025
me013|i mean|D|Bmr025
fe016|right.|S|Bmr025
me013|uh part of the reason i think part of the reason that adam was so interested in uh the speechcorder sort of idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes.|S|Bmr025
me011|yep.|S|Bmr025
me013|and|F|Bmr025
me013|and so forth.|S|Bmr025
me013|so and and jane is more into it.|S|Bmr025
me013|but uh uh|F|Bmr025
me013|you know i don't know if you want to really do do this all the time.|S|Bmr025
me013|so i think the thing is to to get someone to actually buy into it.|S|Bmr025
me013|and have at least some series of meetings where we do it.|S|Bmr025
me013|um|F|Bmr025
me013|and if so it's probably worth having one.|S|Bmr025
me013|the the the problem with the the more extended view|D|Bmr025
me013|all these other you know with uh quibbling about particular applications of it|D|Bmr025
me013|is that it looks like it's hard to get people to um uh routinely use it.|S|Bmr025
me013|i mean it just hasn't happened anyway.|S|Bmr025
me013|but maybe if we can get a person to|D|Bmr025
fe016|yeah i don't think it has to be part of what everybody does in a meeting.|S|Bmr025
fe016|but it might be a useful neat part of the project.|S|Bmr025
fe016|that we can you know show off as a mechanism for synchronizing events in time.|S|Bmr025
fe016|that happen that you just want to make a note of.|S|Bmr025
fe016|like what jane was talking about.|S|Bmr025
fe016|with some later browsing just just as a convenience.|S|Bmr025
fe016|even if it's not a full blown note taking substitute.|S|Bmr025
me022|well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a p d a with a wireless card.|S|Bmr025
me022|and and that way you can synchronize very easily with the the the meeting.|S|Bmr025
me022|because you'll be you can synchronize with the the linux server.|S|Bmr025
me022|and uh|F|Bmr025
fe016|so what kind of input would you be|D|Bmr025
me022|so so i mean if you're not worried about|D|Bmr025
me011|buttons.|S|Bmr025
fe016|you'd just be pressing like a a|D|Bmr025
me022|well well you have a p d a.|S|Bmr025
me022|and and you could have the same sort of x interface or whatever.|S|Bmr025
me022|i mean you'd have to do a little uh a little bit of coding to do it.|S|Bmr025
fe016|uhhuh.|B|Bmr025
me022|but you could imagine|D|Bmr025
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr025
fe016|that be good.|S|Bmr025
me022|i mean if if all you really wanted was you didn't want this secondary note taking channel.|S|Bmr025
me022|but just sort of being able to use markers of some sort.|S|Bmr025
me022|a p d a with a a wireless card would be the probably the right way to go.|S|Bmr025
me022|i mean even buttons you could do.|S|Bmr025
me022|sort of.|S|Bmr025
me022|i mean as you said.|S|Bmr025
me011|i mean for what what you've been describing buttons would be even more convenient than anything else.|S|Bmr025
fe016|right.|S|Bmr025
me011|right?|Q|Bmr025
fe016|that would be fine too.|S|Bmr025
me011|you have the|D|Bmr025
me022|right.|S|Bmr025
fe016|i mean i don't have you know grandiose ideas in mind.|S|Bmr025
fe016|but i'm just sort of thinking well we've we're getting into the next year now.|S|Bmr025
fe016|and we have a lot of these things worked out at in terms of the speech.|S|Bmr025
fe016|maybe somebody will be interested in this.|S|Bmr025
fe016|and|F|Bmr025
fe008|i like this p d a idea.|S|Bmr025
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me013|yeah i do like the idea of having a couple buttons.|S|Bmr025
me011|well i'm sure there would|D|Bmr025
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me013|where like one one button was uh oh.|S|Bmr025
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me013|and then another button was that's great.|S|Bmr025
me013|and another button that's|D|Bmr025
fe016|or like this is my i'm supposed to do this kind of button.|S|Bmr025
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr025
fe016|like i better remember to|D|Bmr025
me011|action item.|S|Bmr025
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr025
fe016|something like that.|S|Bmr025
fe016|or|D|Bmr025
me011|i mean i think the crosspad idea is a good one.|S|Bmr025
fe008|and then|D|Bmr025
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr025
me011|it's just a question of getting people to use it.|S|Bmr025
me011|and getting the infrastructure set up in such a way that it's not a lot of extra work.|S|Bmr025
me011|i mean that's part of the reason why it hasn't happened.|S|Bmr025
me011|is that it it's been a lot of extra work for me.|S|Bmr025
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me013|right.|B|Bmr025
me011|and|F|Bmr025
fe008|well and not just for you.|S|Bmr025
fe008|but it's also it has this problem of having to go from an analog to a a digital record too.|S|Bmr025
fe008|doesn't it?|Q|Bmr025
me011|well it's digital but it's in a format that is not particularly standard.|S|Bmr025
fe008|i mean|D|Bmr025
fe008|but i mean say if if if you're writing if you're writing notes in it does it it can't do handwriting recognition.|S|Bmr025
fe008|right?|Q|Bmr025
me013|no no but it's just it's just storing the pixel position information.|S|Bmr025
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr025
me013|it's all digital.|S|Bmr025
fe008|i i guess what i'm thinking is that the p d a solution you you have it already without needing to go from the pixelization to a to a|D|Bmr025
fe008|i mean|D|Bmr025
me013|right.|S|Bmr025
me013|you don't have to|D|Bmr025
me022|the transfer function is less errorful.|S|Bmr025
me022|yes.|S|Bmr025
fe016|yeah yeah.|S|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr025
fe008|oh nicely put.|S|Bmr025
me013|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr025
fe016|well it also it's maybe realistic because people are supposed to be bringing their p d a's to the meeting eventually.|S|Bmr025
fe016|right?|Q|Bmr025
fe016|that's why we have this little|D|Bmr025
fe016|i don't know what i don't want to cause more work for anyone.|S|Bmr025
fe016|but i can imagine some interesting things that you could do with it.|S|Bmr025
fe016|and so if we don't have to return it|D|Bmr025
fe016|and we can keep it for a year|D|Bmr025
fe016|i don't know.|S|Bmr025
me011|well we don't we certainly don't have to return it.|S|Bmr025
me011|as i said all all he said is that if you're not using it could you return it if you are using it feel free to keep it.|S|Bmr025
me011|the point is that we haven't used it at all.|S|Bmr025
me011|and are we going to.|S|Bmr025
me013|so we have no|D|Bmr025
me013|but uh by i i would suggest you return one.|S|Bmr025
me011|okay.|S|Bmr025
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr025
me013|because we we you know we we haven't used it at all.|S|Bmr025
fe016|we|D|Bmr025
me013|we have some aspirations of using them.|S|Bmr025
fe016|one would probably be fine.|S|Bmr025
fe016|maybe we could do like a student project.|S|Bmr025
me013|and|F|Bmr025
fe016|you know maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like project for something would be cool.|S|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me011|yep.|B|Bmr025
me011|i mean if we had them out and sitting on the table people might use them a little more.|S|Bmr025
me013|maybe jeremy could sit in some meetings and press a button when there when when somebody laughed.|S|Bmr025
me011|although there is a little|D|Bmr025
fe016|well i'm yeah that's not a bad|D|Bmr025
me013|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
fe016|jeremy's going to be an he's a new student starting on modeling breath and laughter actually.|S|Bmr025
fe016|which sounds funny.|S|Bmr025
fe016|but i think it should be cool.|S|Bmr025
fe016|so|F|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr025
me011|sounds breathy to me.|S|Bmr025
fe016|okay.|B|Bmr025
me011|breath and|D|Bmr025
fe016|ha ha ha.|S|Bmr025
me011|ha ha ha ha.|S|Bmr025
me011|ha ha ha ha.|S|Bmr025
me013|well dear!|S|Bmr025
me011|um|F|Bmr025
me013|huh.|B|Bmr025
me011|that reminded me of something.|S|Bmr025
me011|oh well.|S|Bmr025
me011|too late.|S|Bmr025
me011|it slipped out.|S|Bmr025
me013|okay.|F|Bmr025
me011|oh!|F|Bmr025
fe016|you're you're going to tease me?|Q|Bmr025
me011|equipment.|S|Bmr025
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr025
me011|ordered|D|Bmr025
me011|uh well i'm always going to do that.|S|Bmr025
me011|uh we ordered uh more wireless.|S|Bmr025
me011|and so they should be coming in at some point.|S|Bmr025
fe016|great.|S|Bmr025
me011|and then at the same time i'll probably rewire the room as per jane's suggestion.|S|Bmr025
me011|so that uh the first n channels are wireless uh are the the close talking and the next n are far field.|S|Bmr025
me013|you know what he means.|S|Bmr025
me013|but isn't that funny sounding?|Q|Bmr025
me013|we ordered more wireless.|S|Bmr025
me013|it's like wires are the things.|S|Bmr025
me013|so you're wiring you're you're you we're we ordered more absence of the thing.|S|Bmr025
fe016|that's a very philosophical statement from morgan.|S|Bmr025
me011|wired less wired more.|S|Bmr025
fe016|i just it's sort of a anachronism.|S|Bmr025
fe016|i mean it's like|D|Bmr025
fe016|it's great.|S|Bmr025
me011|should we do digits?|Q|Bmr025
me013|anyway.|F|Bmr025
me011|do we have anything else?|Q|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr025
fe008|okay.|B|Bmr025
me013|i mean there's there's all this stuff going on uh between uh andreas and and and dave and chuck and others with various kinds of runs.|S|Bmr025
me013|uh um recognition runs.|S|Bmr025
me013|trying to figure things out about the features.|S|Bmr025
me013|but it's it's all sort of in process.|S|Bmr025
me013|so there's not much to say.|S|Bmr025
me013|right now.|S|Bmr025
me013|uh why don't we start with our our esteemed guest?|Q|Bmr025
me022|okay.|F|Bmr025
me022|all right.|F|Bmr025
me011|so just the transcript number and then the then the|D|Bmr025
me022|this is|D|Bmr025
me022|yes this is number two for me today.|S|Bmr025
me013|see all you have to do is go away to move way up in the|D|Bmr025
me022|oh.|B|Bmr025
fe016|we could do simultaneous.|S|Bmr025
fe016|initiate him.|S|Bmr025
me013|we we could.|S|Bmr025
me011|should we do simultaneous?|Q|Bmr025
fe016|well i'm just thinking are you going to try to save the data before this next group comes in?|Q|Bmr025
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr025
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr025
me011|absolutely.|S|Bmr025
fe016|yeah so we might want to do it simultaneous.|S|Bmr025
me011|i mean you sort of have to.|S|Bmr025
fe016|right so|D|Bmr025
me013|well okay so let's do one of those simultaneous ones.|S|Bmr025
fe016|so we might we might need to do that actually.|S|Bmr025
me011|okay.|B|Bmr025
me013|that sounds good.|S|Bmr025
me022|okay.|B|Bmr025
me013|everybody ready?|Q|Bmr025
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr025
me013|a one.|S|Bmr025
fe016|you have to plug your ears by the way uh eric.|S|Bmr025
me011|well i have to.|S|Bmr025
fe016|or|D|Bmr025
me011|i don't know about other people.|S|Bmr025
fe016|or you start laughing.|S|Bmr025
me022|okay all right.|S|Bmr025
mn014|you don't have to.|S|Bmr025
me013|okay.|F|Bmr025
me013|a one and a two and a three.|S|Bmr025
