me013|so uh so the uh the new procedural change that just got suggested which i think is a good idea is that um we do the digit recordings at the end.|S|Bmr006
me013|and that way if we're recording somebody else's uh meeting and a number of the participants have to run off to some other meeting and don't have the time uh then they can run off.|S|Bmr006
me013|it'll mean we'll get somewhat fewer uh sets of digits.|S|Bmr006
me013|but um i think that way we'll cut into people's time um if someone's on strict time uh less.|S|Bmr006
me013|so i i think i think we should start doing that.|S|Bmr006
me013|um so uh let's see we were having a discussion the other day maybe we should bring that up about uh the nature of the data that we are collecting.|S|Bmr006
me013|uh that uh we should have a fair amount of data that is um collected for the same meeting so that we can|D|Bmr006
me013|uh|F|Bmr006
me013|i don't know.|S|Bmr006
me013|what what were some of the points again about that?|Q|Bmr006
me013|is it|D|Bmr006
fe016|uh well okay i'll back up.|S|Bmr006
fe016|um at the previous at last week's meeting this meeting i was griping about wanting to get more data.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe016|and i i talked about this with jane and adam.|S|Bmr006
fe016|um and was thinking of this mostly just so that we could do research on this data um since we'll have a new this new student does want to work with us.|S|Bmr006
fe016|the guy that was at the last meeting.|S|Bmr006
me018|well great.|S|Bmr006
me018|great.|S|Bmr006
fe016|and he's already funded part time.|S|Bmr006
fe016|so we'll only be paying him for sort of for half of the normal part time.|S|Bmr006
me018|what a deal.|S|Bmr006
fe016|uh yeah.|S|Bmr006
me011|and what's he interested in specifically?|Q|Bmr006
fe016|so|D|Bmr006
fe016|he's comes from a signal processing background.|S|Bmr006
fe016|but i liked him a lot.|S|Bmr006
fe016|because he's very interested in higher level things like language and disfluencies and all kinds of maybe prosody.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe016|so he's just getting his feet wet in that.|S|Bmr006
me011|great.|S|Bmr006
fe016|anyway i thought okay maybe we should have enough data so that if he starts he'd be starting in january next semester that we'd have you know enough data to work with.|S|Bmr006
me011|right.|B|Bmr006
fe016|but um jane and adam brought up a lot of good points that just posting a note to berkeley people to have them come down here has some problems in that you you need to make sure that the speakers are who you want and that the meeting type is what you want and so forth.|S|Bmr006
fe016|so i thought about that and i think it's still possible.|S|Bmr006
fe016|um but i'd rather try to get more regular meetings of types that we know about and hear then sort of a mish mosh of a bunch of one onetime.|S|Bmr006
me011|one offs.|S|Bmr006
fe016|yeah just because it would be very hard to process the data in all senses.|S|Bmr006
fe016|both to get the um to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it like well i was talking to morgan about.|S|Bmr006
fe016|things like summarization or what's this meeting about.|S|Bmr006
fe016|i mean it's very different if you have a group that's just giving a report on what they did that week versus coming to a decision and so forth.|S|Bmr006
fe016|so then i was um talking to morgan about some new proposed work in this area sort of a separate issue from what the student would be working on where i was thinking of doing some kind of summarization of meetings or trying to find cues in both the utterances and in the utterance patterns.|S|Bmr006
fe016|like in numbers of overlaps and amount of speech.|S|Bmr006
fe016|sort of raw cues from the interaction that can be measured from the signals and from the different microphones that point to sort of hot spots in the meeting or things where stuff is going on that might be important for someone who didn't attend to listen to.|S|Bmr006
fe016|and in that uh regard i thought we definitely will need it'd it'd be nice for us to have a bunch of data from a few different domains or a few different kinds of meetings.|S|Bmr006
fe016|so this this meeting is one of them.|S|Bmr006
fe016|although i'm not sure i can participate if i|D|Bmr006
fe016|you know i would feel very strange being part of a meeting that you were then analyzing later for things like summarization.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe016|um and then there are some others that that morgan mentioned.|S|Bmr006
fe016|like the front end meeting and maybe a networking group meeting.|S|Bmr006
me011|right.|S|Bmr006
me011|yep.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah we're we're hoping that they'll let us start recording regularly.|S|Bmr006
fe016|so so if that were the case then i think we'd have enough.|S|Bmr006
me011|so|F|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe016|but basically for anything where you're trying to get a summarization of some kind of meeting meaning out of the meeting um it would be too hard to have fifty different kinds of meetings where we didn't really have a good grasp on what does it mean to summarize.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe016|but rather we should have different meetings by the same group but hopefully that have different summaries.|S|Bmr006
fe016|and then we need a couple that of we don't want to just have one group.|S|Bmr006
fe016|because that might be specific to that particular group but three or four different kinds.|S|Bmr006
me013|so|F|Bmr006
me011|yeah we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the morning meeting.|S|Bmr006
fe016|see i've never listened to the data for the front end meeting.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|yeah we we've only had three.|S|Bmr006
me011|so|F|Bmr006
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr006
fe016|but maybe that's enough.|S|Bmr006
fe016|so in general i was thinking more data.|S|Bmr006
fe016|but also data where we hold some parameters constant or fairly similar.|S|Bmr006
fe016|like a meeting about of people doing a certain kind of work where at least half the participants each time are the same.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me011|um|F|Bmr006
me013|now let let me just give you the other side to that.|S|Bmr006
me013|because i because i i don't disagree with that.|S|Bmr006
me013|but i think there is a complimentary piece to it too.|S|Bmr006
me013|uh for other kinds of research particularly the acoustic oriented research i actually feel the opposite need.|S|Bmr006
me013|i'd like to have lots of different people.|S|Bmr006
fe016|right.|B|Bmr006
fe016|right.|B|Bmr006
me013|as many people here and talking about the kind of thing that you were just talking about it would have uh too few people from my point of view.|S|Bmr006
me013|i'd like to have many different speakers.|S|Bmr006
me013|so um i think i would also very much like us to have a fair amount of really random scattered meetings of somebody coming down from campus and and uh|D|Bmr006
mn005|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me013|i mean sure if we can get more from them fine.|S|Bmr006
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe016|right.|B|Bmr006
me013|but if we only get one or two from each group that still could be useful acoustically just because we'd have close and distant microphones with different people.|S|Bmr006
fe016|yeah i definitely agree with that.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe016|definitely.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|can i can i say about that that the the issues that i think adam and i raised were more a matter of advertising so that you get more native speakers.|S|Bmr006
fe008|because i think if you just say|D|Bmr006
fe008|and in particular my suggestion was to advertise to linguistics grad students because there you'd have people who'd have proficiency enough in english that that uh it would be useful for for purposes you know.|S|Bmr006
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|but you know i think i've been i've i i've gathered data from undergrads at on campus.|S|Bmr006
fe008|and if you just post randomly to undergrads i think you'd get such a mixed bag that it would be hard to know how much conversation you'd have at all and and the english you'd have the language models would be really hard to build.|S|Bmr006
me013|well you want to|D|Bmr006
fe008|because it would not really be it would be an interlanguage rather than than a|D|Bmr006
me013|well okay uh first place i i i don't think we'd just want to have random people come down and talk to one another.|S|Bmr006
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr006
me013|i think there should be a meeting that has some goal and point because i i think that's what we're investigating.|S|Bmr006
fe016|it has to be a a pre-existing meeting like a meeting that would otherwise happen anyway.|S|Bmr006
me013|so|F|Bmr006
me013|yeah yeah.|S|Bmr006
me011|right.|B|Bmr006
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr006
me013|so i was i was thinking more in terms of talking to professors uh and and and uh senior uh uh and uh doctoral students who are leading projects and offering to them that they have their hold their meeting down here.|S|Bmr006
me011|yep.|B|Bmr006
fe016|that's i think what we and i agree with.|S|Bmr006
fe008|oh interesting!|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|oh i see.|S|Bmr006
fe008|oh interesting!|S|Bmr006
me013|uh that's the first point.|S|Bmr006
me013|the second point is|D|Bmr006
me013|um|F|Bmr006
me013|i think that for some time now going back through berp i think that we have had speakers that we've worked with who had non native accents and i i think that|D|Bmr006
fe008|oh oh i'm not saying accents.|S|Bmr006
fe008|the accent's not the problem.|S|Bmr006
me013|oh okay.|S|Bmr006
fe008|no it's more a matter of uh proficiency.|S|Bmr006
fe008|just simply fluency.|S|Bmr006
fe008|i mean i deal with people on on campus who i think sometimes people undergraduates um in computer science uh have language skills that make you know that their their fluency and writing skills are not so strong.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|oh!|S|Bmr006
me013|you're not talking about foreign language at all.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah yeah just talking about.|S|Bmr006
me013|you're just talking about|D|Bmr006
fe008|well i just think|D|Bmr006
me011|we all had the same thought.|S|Bmr006
fe008|but you know it's like when you get into the graduate level uh no problem.|S|Bmr006
fe008|i mean i'm not saying accents.|S|Bmr006
mn005|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me013|yeah then we're completely gone.|S|Bmr006
fe008|i'm i'm saying fluency.|S|Bmr006
me013|it's the the habits are already burnt in.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|well yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|i'm just saying fluency.|S|Bmr006
me013|but|F|Bmr006
me011|well i think that um i think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in english.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|and and i think if it's a pre existing meeting and it's held in english i i think it's probably okay if a few of the people don't have uh particularly good english skills.|S|Bmr006
fe008|okay now can i can i say the other aspect of this from my perspective.|S|Bmr006
fe008|which is that um there's there's this this issue you have a corpus out there it should be used for for multiple things.|S|Bmr006
fe008|because it's so expensive to put together.|S|Bmr006
me011|right.|S|Bmr006
me013|right.|B|Bmr006
fe008|and if people want to approach|D|Bmr006
fe008|um|F|Bmr006
fe008|i so i know you know this|D|Bmr006
fe008|the idea of computational linguistics and probabilistic grammars and all may not be the focus of this group.|S|Bmr006
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|but the idea of language models which are you know generally speaking uh you know terms of like the amount of benefit per dollar spent or an hour invested in preparing the data.|S|Bmr006
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|if you have a choice between people who are more proficient in um more fluent more more close to being academic english then it would seem to me to be a good thing.|S|Bmr006
me013|i guess maybe|D|Bmr006
me013|huh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|because otherwise you don't have the ability to have|D|Bmr006
fe008|uh so if if you have a bunch of idiolects that's the worst possible case.|S|Bmr006
fe008|if you have people who are using english as a as an interlanguage because they they don't uh they can't speak in their native languages and but their interlanguage isn't really a match to any existing uh language model.|S|Bmr006
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|this is the worst case scenario.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|well that's pretty much what you're going to have in the networking group.|S|Bmr006
fe008|and|D|Bmr006
me011|right.|B|Bmr006
me013|because because they most the network group is almost entirely germans and spaniards.|S|Bmr006
fe008|well|F|Bmr006
fe008|oh.|S|Bmr006
fe008|but the thing is i think that these people are of high enough level in their in their language proficiency that|D|Bmr006
me013|i see.|S|Bmr006
fe008|and i'm not objecting to accents.|S|Bmr006
fe008|i i'm i'm just thinking that we have to think at a at a higher level view could we have a language model a a grammar a grammar basically that um would be a a possibility.|S|Bmr006
me013|okay.|B|Bmr006
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|so so if you wanted to bring in a model like dan jurafsky's model and do some top down stuff it to help the bottom up and merge the things or whatever uh it seems like um i don't see that there's an argument.|S|Bmr006
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|i'm i what i think is that why not have the corpus since it's so expensive to put together uh useful for the widest range of of central things that people generally use corpora for and which are you know used in computational linguistics.|S|Bmr006
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|that's that's my point which which includes both top down and bottom up.|S|Bmr006
me013|okay.|B|Bmr006
mn005|it's difficult.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|okay well let's let's see what we can get.|S|Bmr006
me013|i mean it it i think that if we're aiming at at uh groups of graduate students and professors and so forth who are talking about things together and it's from the berkeley campus probably most of it will be okay.|S|Bmr006
fe008|yes that's fine.|S|Bmr006
fe008|that's fine.|S|Bmr006
fe008|exactly.|S|Bmr006
fe008|and my point in in my note to liz was i think that undergrads are an iffy population.|S|Bmr006
me013|but|F|Bmr006
me013|okay.|B|Bmr006
fe016|i definitely agree with that i mean for this purpose.|S|Bmr006
me013|okay.|B|Bmr006
me013|okay.|B|Bmr006
fe008|grads and professors fine.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|well not to mention the fact that i would be hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen probably even anyone under twenty one.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|so|F|Bmr006
me013|oh you age-ist!|S|Bmr006
me011|what's that?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|age-ist.|S|Bmr006
me011|well age-ist the eighteen is because of the consent form.|S|Bmr006
fe016|right yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|we'd have to get find their parent to sign for them.|S|Bmr006
mn005|age-ist.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|yes.|B|Bmr006
fe008|yeah that's true.|S|Bmr006
me011|so|B|Bmr006
fe016|i have a uh um question.|S|Bmr006
fe016|well morgan you were mentioning that mari may not use the equipment from i b m if they found something else because there's a|D|Bmr006
me013|they're they're yeah they're they're uh assessing whether they should do that or do something else hopefully over the next few weeks.|S|Bmr006
fe016|because i mean one remote possibility is that if we if we inherited that equipment if she weren't using it could we set up a room in the linguistics department?|Q|Bmr006
fe016|and and i mean there there may be a lot more or or in psych or in wherever in another building where we could um record people there.|S|Bmr006
fe016|i think we'd have a better chance.|S|Bmr006
me011|i think we'd need a real motivated partner to do that.|S|Bmr006
fe016|right.|S|Bmr006
me011|we'd need to find someone on campus who was interested in this.|S|Bmr006
fe016|but|D|Bmr006
fe016|right.|S|Bmr006
fe016|but if there were such a|D|Bmr006
fe016|i mean it's a remote possibility then um you know one of us could you know go up there and record the meeting or something rather than bring all of them down here.|S|Bmr006
me011|yep.|B|Bmr006
fe016|so it's just a just a thought if they end up not using the the hardware.|S|Bmr006
me013|well the other thing yeah i mean the other thing that i was hoping to do in the first place was to turn it into some kind of portable thing so you could wheel it around.|S|Bmr006
me011|right.|B|Bmr006
me013|uh.|B|Bmr006
me013|but um and|D|Bmr006
me011|well i know that space is really scarce on at least in c s.|S|Bmr006
me013|uh.|B|Bmr006
me011|you know to to actually find a room that we could use regularly might actually be very difficult.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe016|but you may not need a separate room you know.|S|Bmr006
me011|that's true.|S|Bmr006
fe016|the idea is if they have a meeting room and they can guarantee that the equipment will be safe and so forth and if one of us is up there once a week to record the meeting or something.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|true.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me011|yep.|B|Bmr006
me013|well maybe john would let us put it into the phonology lab or something.|S|Bmr006
fe016|huh.|F|Bmr006
me011|yep.|B|Bmr006
me013|you know.|F|Bmr006
fe016|i i think it's not out of the question.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|yeah i think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting.|S|Bmr006
fe016|um.|F|Bmr006
fe016|so|F|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|another type of meeting.|S|Bmr006
fe016|right.|B|Bmr006
fe016|right.|B|Bmr006
mn005|but i i i think you need uh another portable thing another portable equipment to to do uh more easier the recording process uh out from icsi.|S|Bmr006
me011|huh.|B|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|uh and probably i don't know.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|right.|B|Bmr006
mn005|uh if you you want to to record uh a seminar or a class uh in the university you you need it it would be uh uh very difficult to to put uh a lot of uh head phones uh in different people when you have to to record only with uh this kind of uh device.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|yeah but|F|Bmr006
me011|i think if we if we want to just record with the tabletop microphones that's easy.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|right?|Q|Bmr006
me011|that's very easy.|S|Bmr006
me011|but that's not the corpus that we're collecting.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|actually that's a that raises an interesting point that came up in our discussion that's maybe worth repeating.|S|Bmr006
me013|we realized that um when we were talking about this that okay there's these different things that we want to do with it.|S|Bmr006
me013|so um it's true that we want to be selective in some ways uh the way that you were speaking about with uh not having an interlingua and uh these other issues.|S|Bmr006
me013|but on the other hand it's not necessarily true that we need all of the corpus to satisfy all of it.|S|Bmr006
me013|so as per the example that we want to have a fair amount that's done with a small recorded with a small uh number of types of meetings.|S|Bmr006
me013|but we can also have another part that's uh just one or two meetings of each of a of a range of them.|S|Bmr006
me013|and that's okay too.|S|Bmr006
me013|uh we realized in discussion that the other thing is what about this business of distant and close microphones.|S|Bmr006
me013|i mean we really want to have a substantial amount recorded this way.|S|Bmr006
me013|that's why we did it.|S|Bmr006
me013|but what about for for these issues of summarization a lot of these higher level things you don't really need the distant microphone.|S|Bmr006
fe016|right.|S|Bmr006
fe016|i mean i i think there's|D|Bmr006
me013|you actually don't.|S|Bmr006
me011|and you don't really need the close microphone you mean.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe016|yeah yeah you actually don't really even need any fancy microphone.|S|Bmr006
fe008|which one did you mean?|Q|Bmr006
me013|you you don't it doesn't you just need some microphone somewhere.|S|Bmr006
fe016|you can use found data.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah yep.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|tape recorder.|S|Bmr006
fe008|oh.|B|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe016|you you can.|S|Bmr006
me013|you need some microphone.|S|Bmr006
fe016|you can.|S|Bmr006
fe016|use um but i think that any data that we spend a lot of effort to collect|D|Bmr006
me013|but i mean|D|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe016|you know each person who's interested in i mean we have a we have a bunch of different um slants and perspectives on what it's useful for um they need to be taking charge of making sure they're getting enough of the kind of data that they want.|S|Bmr006
me013|right.|B|Bmr006
fe016|and so in my case um i think there there is enough data for some kinds of projects and not enough for others.|S|Bmr006
me011|not enough for others right.|S|Bmr006
fe016|and so i'm looking and thinking well i'd be glad to walk over and record people and so forth if it's to help in my interest.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe016|and other people need to do that for themselves uh or at least discuss it so that we can find some optimal.|S|Bmr006
me013|right so that|D|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|but i think that i'm raising that because i think it's relevant exactly for this idea up there that if you think about well gee we have this really complicated setup to do well maybe you don't.|S|Bmr006
me013|maybe if if if really all you want is to have a a a recording that's good enough to get a uh a transcription from later you just need to grab a tape recorder and go up and make a recording.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|for some of it.|S|Bmr006
fe016|right.|B|Bmr006
me011|yep.|B|Bmr006
me013|i mean we we could have a fairly we could just get a dat machine and|D|Bmr006
fe016|well i agree with jane though on the other hand that|D|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe016|so that might be true you may say for instance summarization or something that sounds very language oriented.|S|Bmr006
fe016|you may say well oh yeah you just do that from transcripts of a radio show.|S|Bmr006
fe016|i mean you don't even need the speech signal.|S|Bmr006
me013|right.|B|Bmr006
fe016|but what you what i was thinking is long term what would be neat is to be able to pick up on um|D|Bmr006
fe016|suppose you just had a distant microphone there and you really wanted to be able to determine this.|S|Bmr006
fe016|there's lots of cues you're not going to have.|S|Bmr006
fe016|so i do think that long term you should always try to satisfy the greatest number of of interests and have this parallel information which is really what makes this corpus powerful.|S|Bmr006
me011|right.|B|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|special?|Q|Bmr006
me011|yep.|B|Bmr006
me013|i i i i i agree.|S|Bmr006
fe016|otherwise you know lots of other sites can propose individual studies so|D|Bmr006
me013|uh but i i think that the uh we can't really underestimate the difficulty shouldn't really underestimate the difficulty of getting a setup like this up.|S|Bmr006
me011|yep.|B|Bmr006
me013|and so uh it took quite a while to get that together and to say oh we'll just do it up there .|S|Bmr006
fe016|okay.|B|Bmr006
me013|if you're talking about something simple where you throw away a lot of these dimensions then you can do that right away.|S|Bmr006
me013|talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here.|S|Bmr006
me013|it won't happen quickly it won't be easy and there's all sorts of issues about you know keeping the equipment safe or else hauling it around and all sorts of|D|Bmr006
fe016|so then maybe we should try to bring people here.|S|Bmr006
me013|i think the first priority should be to pry to get try to get people to come here.|S|Bmr006
me011|here.|S|Bmr006
fe016|i mean that's that's|D|Bmr006
fe016|okay so.|S|Bmr006
me013|we're set up for it.|S|Bmr006
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe016|okay.|B|Bmr006
me013|the room is is really uh underused.|S|Bmr006
fe016|right.|B|Bmr006
me013|uh|F|Bmr006
fe008|i thought the free lunch idea was a great idea.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah i thought so too.|S|Bmr006
fe016|yeah i and i think we can get people to come here that|D|Bmr006
me013|free lunch is good.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe016|but the issue is you definitely want to make sure that the kind of group you're getting is the right group.|S|Bmr006
fe016|so that you don't waste a lot of your time and the overhead in bringing people down.|S|Bmr006
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me018|no crunchy food.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe016|so well it would be lunch afterwards.|S|Bmr006
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|well i was thinking lunch after.|S|Bmr006
fe016|right.|S|Bmr006
fe016|and they'd have to do their digits or they don't get dessert.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah they have to do their digits or they don't get they don't get their food.|S|Bmr006
me011|yep.|B|Bmr006
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|um i had a i spoke with some people up at haas business school who volunteered.|S|Bmr006
me011|should i pursue that?|Q|Bmr006
fe016|oh definitely yeah.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr006
me011|so|F|Bmr006
me011|they they originally they've decided not to do go into speech.|S|Bmr006
me011|so i'm not sure whether they'll still be so willing to volunteer.|S|Bmr006
me011|but i'll send an email and ask.|S|Bmr006
me013|tell them about the free lunch.|S|Bmr006
me011|i'll tell them about the free lunch.|S|Bmr006
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr006
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr006
me011|and they'll say there's no such thing.|S|Bmr006
me011|so|F|Bmr006
fe016|i'd love to get people that are not linguists or engineers because these are both weird.|S|Bmr006
me011|right.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|the the the the other|D|Bmr006
fe016|well i know i shouldn't say that.|S|Bmr006
me011|that's all right.|S|Bmr006
me011|no they they're very weird.|S|Bmr006
fe016|we need a wider sampling.|S|Bmr006
me018|beep.|S|Bmr006
me013|uh|F|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|beep.|S|Bmr006
me013|uh the the|D|Bmr006
me011|the problem with engineers is beep.|S|Bmr006
me013|they make funny sounds.|S|Bmr006
me013|the the the other the other thing is uh that we we talked about is give to them uh burn an extra c d rom.|S|Bmr006
me011|yep let them have their meeting.|S|Bmr006
me013|and give them so if they want a basically and audio record of their|D|Bmr006
fe016|well i thought that was i thought he meant give them a music c d like they then he said a c d of the of their speech.|S|Bmr006
me013|oh.|S|Bmr006
fe016|and i guess it depends of what kind of audience you're talking to.|S|Bmr006
fe016|but you know i personally would not want a c d of my meeting.|S|Bmr006
me011|of the meeting.|S|Bmr006
fe016|but maybe yeah maybe you're|D|Bmr006
me013|if you're having some planning meeting of some sort and uh you'd like|D|Bmr006
fe016|right right right.|B|Bmr006
me018|oh that's a good idea.|S|Bmr006
me011|it'd be fun.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|i think it would just be fun you know if nothing else you know.|S|Bmr006
fe016|right.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|but it it it it also i think builds up towards the goal.|S|Bmr006
me011|it's a novelty item.|S|Bmr006
fe016|right.|B|Bmr006
me013|we're saying look you know you're going to get this.|S|Bmr006
me013|isn't that neat.|S|Bmr006
me013|then you're going to go home with it.|S|Bmr006
me013|it's actually it's probably going to be pretty useless to you.|S|Bmr006
me011|yep.|B|Bmr006
me013|but you'll appreciate you know where it's useful and where it's useless.|S|Bmr006
fe016|right.|B|Bmr006
me013|and then we're going to move this technology so it'll become useful.|S|Bmr006
fe016|no i think that's a great idea actually.|S|Bmr006
me013|so|F|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe016|but we might need a little more to incentivize them that's all.|S|Bmr006
me018|what if you could tell them that you'll give them the the transcripts when they come back?|Q|Bmr006
me011|oh yeah.|S|Bmr006
me011|i mean anyone can have the transcripts so i thought we could point that out.|S|Bmr006
me013|oh yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe016|well that's interesting.|S|Bmr006
fe008|i i have to uh raise a little eensy weensy concern about doing giving them the c d immediately because of these issues of you know this kind of stuff where maybe you know.|S|Bmr006
me013|good point.|S|Bmr006
fe008|so|F|Bmr006
me013|that's a very good point.|S|Bmr006
fe008|we could burn it after it's been cleared with the transcript stage.|S|Bmr006
me013|so we can so we can|D|Bmr006
me013|right.|S|Bmr006
fe008|and then they they get a c d but just not the same day.|S|Bmr006
fe016|oh right.|B|Bmr006
fe016|if it should be the same c d rom that we distribute publically.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah that's right.|S|Bmr006
me011|that's a good point.|S|Bmr006
fe016|right?|Q|Bmr006
me011|right it can't be the internal one.|S|Bmr006
fe016|otherwise they're not allowed to play it for anyone.|S|Bmr006
me013|although it's|D|Bmr006
fe008|there we go.|S|Bmr006
fe008|oh i like that.|S|Bmr006
me011|that's right.|S|Bmr006
fe008|well put well put.|S|Bmr006
fe008|so after the transcript screening phase.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah that's true.|S|Bmr006
fe008|things have been weeded out.|S|Bmr006
fe016|otherwise we'd need two lawyer stages.|S|Bmr006
fe008|yeah that's right say yeah well i got this c d and your honor i|D|Bmr006
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe016|that's a good point.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah so that's so let's start with haas and yeah.|S|Bmr006
fe016|sorry to have to sorry i have to leave.|S|Bmr006
fe016|i will be here full time next week.|S|Bmr006
me013|oh that's fine.|S|Bmr006
me011|okay see you.|S|Bmr006
me013|okay.|B|Bmr006
me011|no.|S|Bmr006
me011|bye.|S|Bmr006
me013|that's all right.|S|Bmr006
me018|see you.|S|Bmr006
me013|okay.|S|Bmr006
mn005|see you.|S|Bmr006
me013|so uh let's see.|S|Bmr006
me013|so that was that topic.|S|Bmr006
me013|and then um i guess another topic would be where are we in the whole disk resources question.|S|Bmr006
me013|for|D|Bmr006
me011|we are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have uh enough room to record meetings.|S|Bmr006
me011|so i uh did a bunch of archiving and still doing a bunch of archiving.|S|Bmr006
me011|i i'm in the midst of doing the p files from uh broadcast news.|S|Bmr006
me011|and it took eleven hours to do to uh copy it.|S|Bmr006
mn005|eleven?|D|Bmr006
me011|and it'll take another eleven to do the clone.|S|Bmr006
me018|where did you copy it to?|Q|Bmr006
me011|well it's abbott.|S|Bmr006
me011|it's abbott so it just but it's it's a lot of data.|S|Bmr006
me013|it's copying from one place on abbott to another place on abbott?|Q|Bmr006
me011|tape.|S|Bmr006
mn005|tape?|D|Bmr006
me011|i did an archive.|S|Bmr006
me013|oh!|S|Bmr006
me013|i'm sorry.|S|Bmr006
me018|oh on the tape.|S|Bmr006
mn005|oh.|B|Bmr006
me018|uh.|B|Bmr006
me011|so i'm archiving it and then i'm going to delete the files.|S|Bmr006
me011|so that will give us ten gigabytes of free space.|S|Bmr006
mn005|eleven hours?|D|Bmr006
me018|wow!|S|Bmr006
mn005|oh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|yeah the archiving program does take a long time.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|and and|D|Bmr006
me011|yep.|S|Bmr006
me011|and so that that will be done like in about two hours.|S|Bmr006
me011|and so uh at that point we'll be able to record five more meetings.|S|Bmr006
me011|so|F|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|one thing the good news about that that is that once once it's archived it's pretty quick to get back.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|i mean it it it the other direction is fast but this direction is really slow.|S|Bmr006
me013|is it?|Q|Bmr006
me011|right.|S|Bmr006
me013|huh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|well especially because i'm generating a clone also.|S|Bmr006
fe008|yeah okay.|S|Bmr006
me011|so and that takes a while.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|generating a clone?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|yeah that's a good point.|S|Bmr006
me011|two copies.|S|Bmr006
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|one offsite one onsite.|S|Bmr006
me018|oh.|S|Bmr006
me018|oh.|S|Bmr006
me018|huh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|now what will uh is the plan to to so stuff will be saved it's just that you're relocating it?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|i mean so we're going to get more disk space?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|or did i|D|Bmr006
me011|no the the these are the p files from broadcast news which are regeneratable regeneratable.|S|Bmr006
fe008|okay.|B|Bmr006
fe008|oh good.|S|Bmr006
fe008|i see.|S|Bmr006
me011|um if we really need to but we had a lot of them and for the full uh hundred forty hour sets.|S|Bmr006
fe008|okay.|B|Bmr006
me011|and so they they were two gigabytes per file and we had six of them or something.|S|Bmr006
fe008|wow!|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|wow!|S|Bmr006
me013|we are getting more space.|S|Bmr006
me013|we are getting uh another disk rack and and four thirty six gigabyte disks.|S|Bmr006
me013|uh so uh but that's not going to happen instantaneously.|S|Bmr006
fe008|wonderful.|S|Bmr006
me011|or maybe six.|S|Bmr006
me013|or maybe six?|Q|Bmr006
me011|the sun uh takes more disks than the andatico one did.|S|Bmr006
me013|how many?|Q|Bmr006
me011|the sun rack takes one took four and one took six or maybe it was eight and twelve whatever it was it was you know fifty per cent more.|S|Bmr006
me013|how much|D|Bmr006
me018|is there a difference in price or something?|Q|Bmr006
me011|well what happened is that we we bought all our racks and disks from andatico for years according to dave.|S|Bmr006
me011|and andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices.|S|Bmr006
me018|oh!|S|Bmr006
mn005|oh.|B|Bmr006
me011|and so uh we're looking into other vendors.|S|Bmr006
me011|we by we of course i mean dave.|S|Bmr006
fe008|wow.|B|Bmr006
me011|so|F|Bmr006
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me018|huh i've been looking at the uh aurora data and um first first look at it there were basically three directories on there that could be moved.|S|Bmr006
me018|one was called aurora one was spanish which was carmen's spanish stuff and the other one was um spine.|S|Bmr006
me011|spine.|S|Bmr006
me018|and so um i wrote to dan and he was very concerned that the spine stuff was moving to a non backed up disk.|S|Bmr006
me018|so um i realized that well probably not all of that should be moved just the c d rom type data the the static data.|S|Bmr006
me018|so i moved that and then um i asked him to check out and see if it was okay.|S|Bmr006
me018|before i actually deleted the old stuff um but i haven't heard back yet.|S|Bmr006
me018|i told him he could delete it if he wanted to i haven't checked today to see if he's deleted it or not.|S|Bmr006
me018|and then carmen's stuff i realized that when i had copied all of her stuff to x a i had copied stuff there that was dynamic data.|S|Bmr006
me018|and so i had to redo that one and just copy over the static data.|S|Bmr006
me018|and so i need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the disk.|S|Bmr006
me018|and then i haven't done any of the aurora stuff.|S|Bmr006
me018|i have to meet with uh stephane to do that.|S|Bmr006
me018|so|F|Bmr006
me013|so but uh you're figuring you can record another five meetings or something with the space that you're clearing up from the broadcast news.|S|Bmr006
me013|but we have some other disks some of which you're using for aurora.|S|Bmr006
me013|but are we do we have some other other space now?|Q|Bmr006
me011|yep.|S|Bmr006
me011|so so uh we have space on the current disk right now where meeting recorder is.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|and that's probably enough for about four meetings.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|is that the one that has is that d c?|Q|Bmr006
me011|so|F|Bmr006
me011|yep.|S|Bmr006
me011|no no.|S|Bmr006
me011|well it's wherever the meeting recorder currently is.|S|Bmr006
me011|i think it's d i.|S|Bmr006
me018|okay.|S|Bmr006
me018|i but the stuff i'm moving from aurora is on the d c disk that we|D|Bmr006
me011|i don't remember.|S|Bmr006
me011|i think it's d it's whatever that one is.|S|Bmr006
me018|okay d c.|S|Bmr006
me011|i just don't remember it might be d c.|S|Bmr006
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|and that has enough for about four more meetings right now.|S|Bmr006
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me011|yeah i mean we were at a hundred per cent and then we dropped down to eighty six for reasons i don't understand.|S|Bmr006
me011|um someone deleted something somewhere.|S|Bmr006
me011|and so we have some room again.|S|Bmr006
me011|and then with broadcast news that's five or six more meetings.|S|Bmr006
me011|so you know we have a couple weeks.|S|Bmr006
me011|uh so yeah i think i think we're okay until we get the new disk.|S|Bmr006
mn005|okay.|B|Bmr006
me018|so should um one question i had for you was um we need we probably should move the aurora and all that other stuff off of the meeting recorder disk.|S|Bmr006
me018|is there another backed up disk that you know of that would|D|Bmr006
me011|we should put it onto the broadcast news one.|S|Bmr006
me011|that's probably the best thing to do and that way we consolidate meeting recorder onto one disk rather than spreading them out.|S|Bmr006
me018|okay.|S|Bmr006
me018|right.|S|Bmr006
me018|right.|S|Bmr006
me018|do you know what happen to know what disk that is off?|Q|Bmr006
me011|no.|S|Bmr006
me018|okay.|S|Bmr006
me011|i mean i can tell you i just don't know off the top of my head.|S|Bmr006
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|okay.|B|Bmr006
me018|all right i'll find out from you.|S|Bmr006
me011|but so we could just do that at the end of today once the archive is complete and i've verified it.|S|Bmr006
me018|okay.|S|Bmr006
me011|because that'll give us plenty of disk.|S|Bmr006
me013|uh okay so uh then i guess the last thing i'd had on my my agenda was just to hear hear an update on what what jose has been doing.|S|Bmr006
mn005|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me013|so|F|Bmr006
mn005|okay.|F|Bmr006
mn005|i have uh the result of my work during the last days.|S|Bmr006
me013|okay.|B|Bmr006
mn005|thank you for your information because i i read uh and the the last uh days uh i work uh in my house uh in a lot of ways and thinking reading uh different things about the the meeting recording project.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|and i have uh some ideas.|S|Bmr006
mn005|uh this information is very very useful.|S|Bmr006
fe008|i'm glad to hear it glad to hear it.|S|Bmr006
mn005|you have the the the distribution now.|S|Bmr006
mn005|but for me uh is interesting because uh uh here's is the demonstration of the overlap uh problem.|S|Bmr006
me011|i've seen it already.|S|Bmr006
mn005|it's a real problem a frequently problem uh because you have overlapping zones uh uh uh all the time.|S|Bmr006
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|yep.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|throughout the meeting.|S|Bmr006
mn005|uh by a moment i have uh nnn the uh i i did a mark of all the overlapped zones in the meeting recording.|S|Bmr006
mn005|with uh a exact mark.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me011|oh you did that by hand?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|that's uh yet yeah by by hand by hand because uh uh why.|S|Bmr006
me011|can i see that?|Q|Bmr006
me011|can i get a copy?|Q|Bmr006
me013|oh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|my my idea is to work|D|Bmr006
mn005|i i i i i don't i don't know uh if uh it will be possible because i i i haven't a lot uh enough time to to to work uh only just uh six months as you know.|S|Bmr006
me018|wow!|S|Bmr006
mn005|but uh my idea is uh is very interesting to to work in in the line of uh automatic segmenter.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|uh but uh uh in my opinion we need uh uh a reference uh session to to to evaluate the the the tool.|S|Bmr006
me011|yes absolutely.|S|Bmr006
me011|and so are you planning to do that or have you done that already?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|and no no with|D|Bmr006
mn005|sorry?|Q|Bmr006
me011|have you done that or are you planning to do that?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|no i i plan to do that.|S|Bmr006
me011|okay.|S|Bmr006
me011|darn!|S|Bmr006
mn005|i plan i plan but uh uh the idea is the is the following.|S|Bmr006
mn005|now uh i need um to detect uh all the overlapping zones exactly.|S|Bmr006
mn005|i i will i will uh talk about uh in the in the blackboard about the my ideas.|S|Bmr006
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|duration.|S|Bmr006
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|uh um uh this information uh with uh exactly time marks uh for the overlapping zones uh overlapping zone and uh a speaker a a pure speech uh uh speaker zone.|S|Bmr006
mn005|i mean uh zones uh of uh speech of uh one speaker without any any uh noise uh any any acoustic event uh that uh uh uh is not uh speech real speech.|S|Bmr006
mn005|and i need true uh silence.|S|Bmr006
mn005|for that because my my idea is to to study the nnn the the set of parameters uh what uh are more more discriminant to uh classify.|S|Bmr006
me011|right.|B|Bmr006
mn005|the overlapping zones in cooperation with the speech uh zones.|S|Bmr006
mn005|the idea is to uh to use uh i'm not sure to uh yet but uh my idea is to use a a cluster uh algorithm or nnn a person strong in neural net algorithm to uh to uh study.|S|Bmr006
mn005|what is the uh the property of the different uh feature uh to classify uh speech and overlapping uh speech.|S|Bmr006
me018|huh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|and my idea is uh it would be interesting to to have uh a control set.|S|Bmr006
mn005|and my control set uh will be the uh silence silence without uh any any noise.|S|Bmr006
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|which means that we'd still you'd hear the|D|Bmr006
fe008|yeah that's interesting.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah acoustic with this with with yeah the background.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah fans.|S|Bmr006
fe008|this is like a ground level with it's it's not total silence.|S|Bmr006
mn005|uh i i mean uh noise uh uh claps uh tape clips uh the difference uh|D|Bmr006
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|uh uh event uh which uh uh has uh uh a hard effect of spectral distortion in the in the uh speech.|S|Bmr006
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me011|so so you intend to hand mark those and exclude them?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|yeah i have in in in in that not in all in all the the file.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|S|Bmr006
mn005|only uh uh nnn huh i have uh um i don't remind what is the the the the quantity.|S|Bmr006
mn005|but uh i i have marked enough speech on and all the overlapping zones.|S|Bmr006
mn005|i have uh two hundred and thirty more or less overlapping zones and is similar to to this information.|S|Bmr006
me011|whew!|S|Bmr006
fe008|great great.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|because with the program i cross the information of uh of jane with uh my my segmentation by hand.|S|Bmr006
mn005|and is uh more similar.|S|Bmr006
fe008|excellent.|S|Bmr006
fe008|glad to hear it.|S|Bmr006
fe008|good.|S|Bmr006
mn005|but|F|Bmr006
mn005|sorry sorry.|S|Bmr006
me013|go ahead.|S|Bmr006
mn005|and the the idea is uh i i will use uh i want my idea is uh to uh to classify.|S|Bmr006
me011|i should've got the digital camera.|S|Bmr006
me011|oh well.|S|Bmr006
mn005|i i need uh the exact uh mark of the different uh uh zones.|S|Bmr006
mn005|because i i want to put uh for uh each frame a label indicating it's a supervised and uh hierarchical clustering process.|S|Bmr006
mn005|i i i put uh uh for each frame a label indicating what is the type what is the class uh which it belong.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|uh i mean the class you will overlapping speech overlapping is a class uh speech the class that's|D|Bmr006
me011|non speech.|S|Bmr006
me018|these will be assigned by hand?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|i i i i i i put the mark by hand.|S|Bmr006
me018|based on the|D|Bmr006
me018|uhhuh.|S|Bmr006
mn005|because uh my idea is uh in in the first session i need uh i i need uh to be sure that the information uh that uh i i will cluster is is right because uh uh if not uh i will i will uh return to the speech file to analyze uh what is the problems.|S|Bmr006
me011|well training and validation sure.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|uh and i i'd prefer i would prefer to to have uh this labeled automatically.|S|Bmr006
mn005|but uh uh i need truth.|S|Bmr006
me018|you need truth huh.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah but this is what you're starting with.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|i've got to ask you so uh the difference between the top two|D|Bmr006
mn005|yeah yeah yeah.|S|Bmr006
fe008|so so i start at the bottom so silence is clear.|S|Bmr006
fe008|by speech do you mean speech by one by one person only?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|speech|D|Bmr006
fe008|so this is okay and then and then the top includes people speaking at the same time or or a speaker and a breath overlapping someone else's breath or or clicking overlapping with speech so that that's all those possibilities in the top one.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|is|D|Bmr006
me011|one two or more.|S|Bmr006
mn005|one two three.|S|Bmr006
mn005|but|D|Bmr006
mn005|no by by the moment yeah yeah yeah.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|S|Bmr006
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr006
mn005|uh in the first moment because uh uh i i have information uh of the overlapping zones uh information about if the uh overlapping zone is uh from a speech clear speech from a one to a two uh speaker or three speaker or is is the zone where the breath of a speaker uh overlaps uh onto uh a speech another especially speech.|S|Bmr006
fe008|so it's it's basically speech with with something overlapping which could be speech but doesn't need to be.|S|Bmr006
mn005|no no especially uh overlapping speech from uh different uh uh speaker.|S|Bmr006
me013|no but there's but i think she's saying where do you in these three categories where do you put the instances in which there is one person speaking and other sounds which are not speech?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|uh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|uh!|B|Bmr006
me013|which category do you put that in?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|yeah that's right that's my question.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|F|Bmr006
mn005|yeah here i i put uh speech from uh from uh one speaker without uh uh any any any events more.|S|Bmr006
fe008|oh!|S|Bmr006
me013|right so where do you put speech from one speaker that does have a non speech event at the same time?|S|Bmr006
me013|which which category?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|like a|D|Bmr006
mn005|where where what is the class?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|no by the moment no.|S|Bmr006
fe008|oh.|B|Bmr006
me011|yeah yeah that's what he was saying before.|S|Bmr006
fe008|so you don't it's not in that|D|Bmr006
me013|oh so you not not marked.|S|Bmr006
mn005|for for the by the no because i i i i want to limit the the nnn the the study.|S|Bmr006
me013|okay.|B|Bmr006
me013|got it.|S|Bmr006
me013|fine so so|D|Bmr006
me011|yeah so that's what he was saying before is that he excluded those.|S|Bmr006
me018|so you're not using all of the data.|S|Bmr006
mn005|the all i exactly.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah you mean.|S|Bmr006
fe008|so you're ignoring overlapping events unless they're speech with speech.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah|D|Bmr006
me013|yeah that's fine.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|S|Bmr006
fe008|okay.|B|Bmr006
mn005|why?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|why?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|what's the reason?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|because it's the first study.|S|Bmr006
me013|oh no no it's a perfectly sensible way to go.|S|Bmr006
mn005|the first|D|Bmr006
fe008|we're|D|Bmr006
me013|we just wondered trying to understand what what you were doing.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|yeah because you've talked about other overlapping events in the past.|S|Bmr006
me013|okay.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|so this is this is a subset.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|in the in the future the the idea is to to extend the class.|S|Bmr006
me018|is is|D|Bmr006
mn005|to consider all the all the information you you mentioned before.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah yeah i i don't think we were asking for that.|S|Bmr006
fe008|okay|D|Bmr006
me013|we were just trying to understand.|S|Bmr006
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|but uh the the first idea because uh i don't know what what will happen with the study.|S|Bmr006
fe008|yeah we just wanted to know what the category was here.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|right.|B|Bmr006
me013|sure.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|F|Bmr006
me018|is your silence category pure silence or|D|Bmr006
me018|what if there was a door slam or something?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|it's pure|D|Bmr006
mn005|no no it's pure silence.|S|Bmr006
me018|pure silence.|S|Bmr006
mn005|it's the control set.|S|Bmr006
me018|okay.|S|Bmr006
mn005|okay.|B|Bmr006
mn005|it's the control set.|S|Bmr006
me013|what you|D|Bmr006
mn005|it's pure pure silence with the with the machine on the on the roof.|S|Bmr006
me013|well|F|Bmr006
me013|i i think what you i think what you mean is that it's non speech segments that don't have impulsive noises.|S|Bmr006
me011|with the fan.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|right?|Q|Bmr006
me013|because you're calling what you're calling event is somebody coughing or clicking or rustling paper or hitting something which are impulsive noises.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|but steady state noises are part of the background.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|which are being included in that.|S|Bmr006
me013|right?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|here yet yet i i i i i think i i think uh there are that some kind of noises that uh don't don't wanted to to be in that uh in that control set.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|so it's like a signal noise situation.|S|Bmr006
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|well|D|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr006
mn005|but i prefer i prefer at at the first uh the the silence with uh this uh this kind of the of uh of noise.|S|Bmr006
fe008|well steady state.|S|Bmr006
me013|right it's i mean it's background might be might be a better word than silence.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|it's just sort of that the the background acoustic.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|right so fine go on.|S|Bmr006
mn005|is is is only|D|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|okay.|S|Bmr006
fe008|well we needed to get the categories yeah.|S|Bmr006
mn005|and um with this information the idea is uh uh nnn i have a label for for each uh frame and uh with a cluster uh algorithm i and|D|Bmr006
mn005|sorry.|S|Bmr006
mn005|and uh i am going to prepare a test bed uh well uh a a set of feature structure uh uh models.|S|Bmr006
me011|right.|S|Bmr006
mn005|and my idea is|D|Bmr006
me011|tone whatever.|S|Bmr006
mn005|so so on because i have a pitch extractor yet.|S|Bmr006
me013|right.|B|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|i have to to test but uh i|D|Bmr006
me018|you have your own?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|yeah yeah yeah.|S|Bmr006
me018|oh!|S|Bmr006
mn005|i i have prepare.|S|Bmr006
mn005|is a modified version of of of a pitch tracker uh from uh uh stanford university.|S|Bmr006
mn005|in stanford?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|no.|S|Bmr006
mn005|from uh them cambridge university.|S|Bmr006
me018|oh!|S|Bmr006
me018|what's it written in?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|uh them i i i don't remember what is the the name of the of the author.|S|Bmr006
mn005|because i i have several i have uh uh them uh library tools from uh festival and of from edinburgh uh from cambridge uh and from our department.|S|Bmr006
me018|uh.|B|Bmr006
me013|uhhuh uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|and and i have to because in general the pitch tracker doesn't work very well and|D|Bmr006
me011|bad.|S|Bmr006
me011|right.|S|Bmr006
me011|but you know as a feature it might be okay.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah yeah.|S|Bmr006
me011|so we don't know.|S|Bmr006
mn005|this this is and the idea is to to uh to obtain uh for example uh uh uh uh different well no a great number of uh f e c for example uh uh twenty five uh thirty thirty parameters uh for for each one.|S|Bmr006
mn005|and in a first uh nnn step in the in the research uh my idea is try to uh to prove what is the performance of the difference parameter uh to classify the different uh what is the the the the front end approach to classify uh the different uh frames of each class uh and what is the the nnn nnn nnn uh what is the the error uh of the data.|S|Bmr006
me011|supervised clustering.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|this is the the uh first idea.|S|Bmr006
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|and the second is try to uh to use some ideas uh similar to the linear discriminant analysis.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|uh|D|Bmr006
mn005|uh similar because the idea is to to study what is the contribution of uh each parameter to the process of classify correctly the different the different parameters.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me011|what sort of classifier|D|Bmr006
mn005|uh the the the classifier is nnn by the moment is uh is uh similar nnn that the classifier used uh in a quantifier vectorial quantifier is uh used to to uh some distance to to put uh a vector uh in in a class different.|S|Bmr006
mn005|is yeah with a model is is only to cluster using a uh or a similarity.|S|Bmr006
me011|unimodal?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me011|so is it just one cluster per|D|Bmr006
mn005|another possibility it to use uh a a neural network.|S|Bmr006
me011|right.|S|Bmr006
mn005|but uh what's the what is my idea?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|what's the problem i i i i see in in in if you you use the the neural network?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|if when this kind of uh huh cluster clustering algorithm to can test to can uh observe what happened you you can't you can't uh uh put up with your hand in the different parameter.|S|Bmr006
me011|right you can't analyze it.|S|Bmr006
mn005|but uh if you use a neural net is is a good idea but uh you don't know what happened in the interior of the neural net.|S|Bmr006
me013|well actually you can do sensitivity analyses which show you what the importance of the different pieces of the input are.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|it's hard to what you it's hard to tell on a neural net is what's going on internally.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|but it's actually not that hard to analyze it and figure out the effects of different inputs especially if they're all normalized.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|um but|D|Bmr006
me011|well using something simpler first i think is probably fine.|S|Bmr006
me013|well this isn't if if if you really wonder what different if if|D|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|but|D|Bmr006
me011|decision tree.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah then a decision tree is really good.|S|Bmr006
me013|but the thing is here he's he's not he's not like he has one you know a bunch of very distinct variables like pitch and this he's talking about like all these cepstral coefficients and so forth.|S|Bmr006
me011|right.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|right.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|in which case any reasonable classifier is going to be a mess and it's going to be hard to figure out what what uh|D|Bmr006
mn005|and|D|Bmr006
me011|right.|B|Bmr006
mn005|i i i will include too the the the differential derivates too.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|deltas.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah so.|F|Bmr006
me013|i i mean i think the other thing that one i mean this is i think a good thing to do to sort of look at these things at least|D|Bmr006
me013|see what i'd i'd let me tell you what i would do.|S|Bmr006
me013|i would take just a few features instead of taking all the m f c c's or all the p l p's or whatever i would just take a couple.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|okay.|F|Bmr006
me013|like like c one c two something like that so that you can visualize it.|S|Bmr006
me013|and look at these different examples and look at scatter plots.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|okay so before you do build up any kind of fancy classifiers just take a look in two dimensions at how these things are split apart.|S|Bmr006
me013|that i think will give you a lot of insight of what is likely to be a useful feature when you put it into a more complicated classifier.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|and the second thing is once you actually get to the point of building these classifiers what this lacks so far is the temporal properties.|S|Bmr006
me013|so if you're just looking at a frame and a time you don't know anything about you know the structure of it over time and so you may want to build build a markov model of some sort uh or or else have features that really are based on um on on some bigger chunk of time.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|but i think this is a good place to start.|S|Bmr006
me013|but don't anyway this is my suggestion is don't just you know throw in twenty features at it the deltas and the delta and all that into some classifier even even if it's k nearest neighbors you still won't know what it's doing even you know it's not a neural net.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|uh i think to know what it's to have a better feeling for what it's doing you want to look at it.|S|Bmr006
me013|so you want to look at at some picture that shows you here's these things uh uh are offer some separation.|S|Bmr006
me011|yep.|B|Bmr006
me013|and uh in l p c uh the thing to particularly look at is i think is something like uh the residual the energy in the residual.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|um so.|F|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|can i ask?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|it strikes me that there's another piece of information um that might be useful and that's simply the transition.|S|Bmr006
fe008|so if you go from a transition of silence to overlap versus a transition from silence to speech there's going to be a a big informative area there it seems to me.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah because|D|Bmr006
mn005|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah i yeah but uh i i is my my own vision of the of the project.|S|Bmr006
me011|so some sort of|D|Bmr006
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|i uh the the meeting recorder project for me has uh two uh has uh several parts several objective.|S|Bmr006
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|uh because it's a a great project.|S|Bmr006
mn005|but uh at the first in the acoustic uh uh parts of the project uh i think you uh we have uh two main uh objective.|S|Bmr006
mn005|one one of these is to uh to detect the change the acoustic change.|S|Bmr006
mn005|and for that if you don't use uh uh a speech recognizer uh broad class or not broad class to to try to to to label the different frames i think the ike criterion or bic criterion uh will be enough to detect the change.|S|Bmr006
mn005|and probably i i i i would like to to prove.|S|Bmr006
mn005|uh probably when you you have uh uh uh the transition of speech or or silence uh to overlap zone this criterion is enough with probably with uh this kind of uh uh the the the more uh use uh use uh used uh them normal regular uh parameter m m f c c.|S|Bmr006
mn005|you you have to to to find you can find the the mark.|S|Bmr006
mn005|you can find the nnn the the acoustic change.|S|Bmr006
mn005|but uh uh i i understand that you your objective is to uh classify to know that uh that zone not is only a new zone in the in the file that uh you have uh but you have to to to know that this is overlap zone.|S|Bmr006
mn005|because in the future you will uh try to to process that zone with a regular uh uh speech recognizer model i suppose.|S|Bmr006
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|you you will pretend to to to process the overlapping uh zone with another kind of algorithm.|S|Bmr006
mn005|because it's very difficult to to to obtain the transcription from uh using uh uh a regular normal speech recognizer.|S|Bmr006
mn005|that you know i i i think is the idea.|S|Bmr006
mn005|and so uh the nnn the the system uh will have two models.|S|Bmr006
mn005|a model to detect more the most accurately possible that is uh will be possible the uh the mark the change.|S|Bmr006
fe008|okay.|B|Bmr006
mn005|and another another model will or several models to try but uh several uh robust models sample models to try to classify the difference class.|S|Bmr006
me011|i'm i'm i'm sorry i didn't understand you what you said.|S|Bmr006
me011|what what model?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|uh the the classifiers of of the to detect the different class to the different zones before try to to recognize uh with uh to transcribe with uh a speech recognizer.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|so|D|Bmr006
mn005|and my idea is to use uh for example a neural net.|S|Bmr006
mn005|with the information we obtain from this uh this uh study of the parameter with the selected parameter to try to uh to put the class of each frame uh for the difference zone.|S|Bmr006
me011|features.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|you you uh uh have obtained in the first uh step with the for example bic uh uh criterion compare model.|S|Bmr006
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|and you|D|Bmr006
me013|okay but i i think in any event we're agreed that the first step is.|S|Bmr006
mn005|i don't|D|Bmr006
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|because what we had before for for uh speaker change detection did not include these overlaps.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|so the first thing is for you to to build up something that will detect the overlaps.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|right?|Q|Bmr006
me013|so again i think the first thing to do to detect the overlaps is to look at these uh in in in in|D|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|features.|S|Bmr006
me013|well i again the things you've written up there i think are way too way too big.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|okay if you're talking about say twelfth twelfth order uh m f c c's or something like that it's just way too much.|S|Bmr006
me013|you won't be able to look at it.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|all you'll be able to do is put it into a classifier and see how well it does.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|whereas i think if you have things if you pick one or two dimensional things or three of you have some very fancy display uh and look at how the the different classes separate themselves out you'll have much more insight about what's going on.|S|Bmr006
mn005|it will be enough.|S|Bmr006
me013|well you'll you'll get a feeling for what's happening you know.|S|Bmr006
me013|so if you look at suppose you look at first and second order cepstral coefficients for some one of these kinds of things and you find that the first order is much more effective than the second and then you look at the third and there's not and not too much there you may just take first and second order cepstral coefficients.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|right?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|and with l p c i think l p c per se isn't going to tell you much more than than than the other maybe.|S|Bmr006
me013|uh and uh on the other hand the l p c residual the energy in the l p c residual will say how well uh the low order l p c model's fitting it which should be pretty poorly for two or more people speaking at the same time and it should be pretty well for for for one.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|and so i again if you take a few of these things that are are um promising features and look at them in pairs uh i think you'll have much more of a sense of okay i now have uh doing a bunch of these analyses.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|i now have ten likely candidates.|S|Bmr006
me013|and then you can do decision trees or whatever to see how they combine.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|i've got a question.|S|Bmr006
fe008|interesting.|S|Bmr006
fe008|huh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|sorry.|S|Bmr006
mn005|but uh uh uh uh uh i don't know it is the first uh way to to do that.|S|Bmr006
mn005|and i would uh like to to know what uh your opinion.|S|Bmr006
mn005|uh all this study in the in the first moment i i i i will pretend to do with uh uh equalizes speech the the equalizes speech the speech uh the mixes of speech.|S|Bmr006
me011|with|D|Bmr006
fe008|with what?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|with what?|Q|Bmr006
me011|right mixed.|S|Bmr006
mn005|the the mix mixed speech.|S|Bmr006
fe008|mixed thank you.|S|Bmr006
mn005|uh why?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|because uh the spectral distortion is more uh a lot uh clearer very much clearer if we compare with the p d a.|S|Bmr006
me011|right.|S|Bmr006
mn005|p d a speech file is uh it will be uh difficult.|S|Bmr006
mn005|i|D|Bmr006
fe008|so it's messier.|S|Bmr006
fe008|the the p d a is messier.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|S|Bmr006
mn005|because the the noise uh to the signal to noise relation is uh is is low.|S|Bmr006
me013|okay.|B|Bmr006
me011|yeah i think that that's a good way to start.|S|Bmr006
mn005|and i don't know.|S|Bmr006
me011|but|D|Bmr006
mn005|i don't know uh uh that uh the the result of the of the study uh with uh with uh this uh this speech the mix speech uh will work exactly with the uh p d a files.|S|Bmr006
me011|it would be interesting in itself to see.|S|Bmr006
mn005|uh what i i mean what is the effect of the low signal to to to noise relation you know uh with|D|Bmr006
me011|well i think that would be an interesting result.|S|Bmr006
me013|well i think i think i think it's not a it's not at all unreasonable.|S|Bmr006
me013|it makes sense to start with the simpler signal.|S|Bmr006
me013|because if you have features which don't aren't even helpful in the high signal to noise ratio then there's no point in putting them into the low signal ratio one would think anyway.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|and so if you can get uh again my prescription would be that you would with a mixed signal you would take a collection of possible uh features look at them look at how these different classes that you've marked separate themselves and then collect uh in pairs and then collect ten of them or something and then proceed with a bigger classifier.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|and then if you can get that to work well then you go to the other signal.|S|Bmr006
me013|and then and you and you know they won't work as well but how you know how much.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|right.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|and then you can re optimize and so on.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah but i think it would be interesting to try a couple with both.|S|Bmr006
me011|because it i think it would be interesting to see if some features work well with close mixed and and don't.|S|Bmr006
me013|huh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|uh yeah yeah yeah yeah.|S|Bmr006
me013|that's well the it it's it's true that it also it could be useful to do this exploratory analysis where you're looking at scatter plots and so on in both cases sure.|S|Bmr006
mn005|but|D|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|i i i i think that the the uh parameter we found uh uh worked with both uh speech file.|S|Bmr006
fe008|that's good.|S|Bmr006
mn005|but uh what is the the the relation of uh of the performance when uh you use uh the uh uh speech the p d a speech files?|Q|Bmr006
me013|huh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah i don't know.|S|Bmr006
me013|right.|B|Bmr006
mn005|but it i i i i think it will be important.|S|Bmr006
mn005|because uh people uh uh different groups eh has uh experience with this uh kind of problem is uh is not easy uh to solve because if you|D|Bmr006
mn005|i i i have seen the the the speech file from uh p d a and some parts is very difficult.|S|Bmr006
mn005|because you you don't see the spectrum the spectrogram.|S|Bmr006
me011|right.|B|Bmr006
mn005|is very difficult to apply uh uh a parameter to detect change when you don't see.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah they're totally hidden.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|well that that that's another reason why very simple features things like energy and things things like harmonicity and residual energy are uh yeah are are better to use than very complex ones because they'll be more reliable.|S|Bmr006
mn005|but i suppose|D|Bmr006
me011|are probably better yep.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah yeah yeah.|S|Bmr006
mn005|i i i will put uh the energy here.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah yeah yeah.|S|Bmr006
me013|chuck was going to ask something i guess.|S|Bmr006
mn005|you have a question?|Q|Bmr006
me018|yeah i maybe this is a dumb question.|S|Bmr006
me018|but i thought it would be i thought it would be easier if you used a p d a.|S|Bmr006
me013|nah.|S|Bmr006
me018|because can't you couldn't you like use beam forming or something detect speaker overlaps?|Q|Bmr006
me018|i mean|D|Bmr006
me011|well if you used the array rather than the signal from just one.|S|Bmr006
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me013|yeah no you're you're right.|S|Bmr006
me011|but that's|D|Bmr006
me013|that in fact if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones you do have some location information which we don't have with the one.|S|Bmr006
me013|and and so that's|D|Bmr006
me018|is that not allowed with this project?|Q|Bmr006
me013|uh well no i mean we don't have any rules really.|S|Bmr006
me018|but i didn't mean i given given the goal.|S|Bmr006
me013|i think i i think i think it's it's it's a it's an additional interesting question.|S|Bmr006
me018|i mean is is that violation of the|D|Bmr006
mn005|oh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|no.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|i mean i think you want to know whether you can do it with one.|S|Bmr006
me013|because you know it's not necessarily true that every device that you're trying to do this with will have two.|S|Bmr006
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|uh if on the other hand we show that there's a huge advantage with two well then that could be a real point.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|but we don't even know yet what the effect of detecting having the ability to detect overlaps is.|S|Bmr006
me013|you know maybe it doesn't matter too much.|S|Bmr006
me018|right.|S|Bmr006
me018|right.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|so this is all pretty early stages.|S|Bmr006
me018|okay.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|but no you're absolutely right.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|i see.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah yeah yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|that's a good thing to consider.|S|Bmr006
me018|okay.|S|Bmr006
fe008|there there is a complication though and that is if a person turns their back to the to the p d a then some of the positional information goes away.|S|Bmr006
me013|well it it it does it it does but the the the issue is that that|D|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|no it's not it's not that so much as|D|Bmr006
fe008|and then and if they're on the access on the axis of it that was the other thing i was thinking.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|he you mentioned this last time that that if if you're straight down the midline then then the the left right's going to be different.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah we need to put it on a little turntable.|S|Bmr006
mn005|i i i i i|F|Bmr006
me011|and|D|Bmr006
me018|well|D|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|and and and in his case i mean he's closer to it anyway.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|it seems to me that that it's not a uh you know it's this the the topology of it is is a little bit complicated.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|but it's another source of information.|S|Bmr006
mn005|i i yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|i don't i don't know|D|Bmr006
mn005|i i i think|D|Bmr006
mn005|sorry.|S|Bmr006
mn005|i i i think because the distance between the two uh microphone uh in the p d a is very near.|S|Bmr006
mn005|but it's uh from my opinion it's an interesting idea to to try to study the binaural uh problem uh with information because i i found difference between the the speech from from each uh in the p d a.|S|Bmr006
me018|i would guess|D|Bmr006
me011|yep.|B|Bmr006
me013|yeah it's timing difference.|S|Bmr006
fe008|oh yeah oh i agree and we use it ourselves.|S|Bmr006
me013|it's not amplitude.|S|Bmr006
me013|right?|Q|Bmr006
me013|right.|S|Bmr006
fe008|i mean i know i i know that's a very important cue.|S|Bmr006
me011|yep.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|but i'm just i'm just saying that the way we're seated around a table is not the same with respect to each to each person with respect to the p d a.|S|Bmr006
mn005|no.|S|Bmr006
mn005|no.|S|Bmr006
mn005|no no no.|S|Bmr006
fe008|so we're going to have a lot of differences with respect to the speaker.|S|Bmr006
me013|that's that's fine.|S|Bmr006
me018|but i don't think that matters though.|S|Bmr006
mn005|but|D|Bmr006
me013|that's so so i think the issue is is there a clean signal coming from only one direction.|S|Bmr006
me018|right.|B|Bmr006
me013|if it's not coming from just one direction if it if if there's a broader pattern it means that it's more likely there's multiple people speaking.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|wherever they are.|S|Bmr006
me018|so it's sort of like how how confused is it about where the beam is.|S|Bmr006
me013|is it a is it|D|Bmr006
me013|yeah is there a narrow is there a narrow beam pattern or is it a a distributed beam pattern?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|so if there's a distributed beam pattern then it looks more like it's it's uh multiple people.|S|Bmr006
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr006
me013|wherever you are even if he moves around.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|okay it just it just seemed to me that uh that this isn't the ideal type of separation.|S|Bmr006
fe008|i mean i i think it's i can see the value|D|Bmr006
me013|oh ideal would be to have the wall filled with them.|S|Bmr006
me013|but i mean but the thing is just having two mikes if you looked at that thing on on dan's page it was when when there were two people speaking and it looked really really different.|S|Bmr006
fe008|yeah okay.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|yep.|B|Bmr006
fe008|oh yeah yeah okay.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|what looked different?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|uh well he was looking at correlation.|S|Bmr006
me011|cross cross correlation.|S|Bmr006
me013|just cross correlation between two sides.|S|Bmr006
mn005|correlation yeah.|S|Bmr006
me013|so cross correlation is pretty sensitive.|S|Bmr006
me018|sorry uh i'm not sure what dan's page is that you mean he was looking at the two|D|Bmr006
fe008|uh his a web page.|S|Bmr006
me013|you take the signal from the two microphones and you and you cross correlate them with different lags.|S|Bmr006
me011|subtract them.|S|Bmr006
me018|okay.|S|Bmr006
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me013|okay.|F|Bmr006
me013|so when one person is speaking then wherever they happen to be at the point when they're speaking then there's a pretty big maximum right around that point in the in in the lag.|S|Bmr006
me013|so if at whatever angle you are at some lag corresponding to the time difference between the two there you get this boost in the in in the cross correlation value function.|S|Bmr006
me018|okay okay.|S|Bmr006
me018|so so if there's two|D|Bmr006
me011|and if there are multiple people talking you'll see two peaks.|S|Bmr006
me013|it's spread out.|S|Bmr006
fe008|well let me ask you if if both people were over there it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across catty corner.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|the oh i'm sorry.|S|Bmr006
fe008|no?|Q|Bmr006
me013|if they're right next to one another?|Q|Bmr006
me018|if i was if i was here and morgan was there and we were both talking it wouldn't work.|S|Bmr006
fe008|next next one over over on this side of the p d a.|S|Bmr006
fe008|there we go.|S|Bmr006
me011|right.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|good example the same one i'm asking.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|yeah i see.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|versus you versus you know and we're catty corner across the table and i'm farther away from this one and you're farther away from that one.|S|Bmr006
me018|yes.|B|Bmr006
me011|or or even if like if people were sitting right across from each other you couldn't tell the difference either.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|it seems like that would be pretty strong.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah oh yeah.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|across the same axis you don't have as much to differentiate.|S|Bmr006
fe008|and so my point was just that it's it's going to be differentially differentially valuable.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|well we yeah we don't have a third dimension there yeah so it's|D|Bmr006
me011|right.|B|Bmr006
fe008|i mean it's not to say i mean i certainly think it's extremely and we we humans depend on you know these these binaural cues.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|but it's almost but it's almost a i think what you're talking about there's two things.|S|Bmr006
fe008|but.|D|Bmr006
me013|there's a sensitivity issue and then there's a pathological error uh issue.|S|Bmr006
me013|so the one where someone is just right directly in line is sort of a pathological error.|S|Bmr006
fe008|yes yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|if someone just happens to be sitting right there then we won't get good information from it.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|okay.|F|Bmr006
fe008|and and if there so it and if it's the two of you guys on the same side|D|Bmr006
me013|uh if they're if they're close it's just a question of the sensitivity.|S|Bmr006
me011|yep.|S|Bmr006
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr006
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr006
me013|so if the sensitivity is good enough and we just we just don't have enough uh experience with it to know how|D|Bmr006
fe008|yeah yeah okay yeah.|S|Bmr006
me011|but|F|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|oh i'm not i'm not trying to argue against using it by any means i just wanted to point out that that weakness that it's topologically impossible to get it perfect for everybody.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me011|and i think dan is still working on it.|S|Bmr006
me011|so he actually he wrote me about it a little bit.|S|Bmr006
me011|so|F|Bmr006
fe008|great.|S|Bmr006
fe008|no i don't mean to discourage that at all.|S|Bmr006
me013|i mean the other thing you can do uh if i mean we're assuming that it would be a big deal just to get somebody convince somebody to put two microphones in the p d a.|S|Bmr006
me013|but if you put a third in you could put in the other axis and then you know then you're sort of yeah then then you pretty much could cover|D|Bmr006
me018|once you got two.|S|Bmr006
fe008|interesting.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|well what about just doing it from these mikes?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|interesting.|S|Bmr006
me018|you know?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|yep.|B|Bmr006
mn005|it will be more interesting to study the p z m because the the separation i i think.|S|Bmr006
me013|uh but that's i mean we we'll be all of this is there for us to study.|S|Bmr006
me011|then they're much broader.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah we can do whatever we want.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|but but but the thing is uh one of the at least one of the things i was hoping to get at with this is what can we do with what we think would be the normal situation if some people get together and one of them has a p d a.|S|Bmr006
me011|whatever you're interested in.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|that's what i was asking about what are the constraints.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|right yeah.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|well that's that's the constraint of one question that i think both adam and i were were were interested in.|S|Bmr006
me011|well|D|Bmr006
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me011|yep.|S|Bmr006
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me013|uh|F|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|but you know if you can instrument a room this is really minor league compared with what some people are doing right?|S|Bmr006
me013|some people at at uh yeah at brown and and and and at uh um and at cape.|S|Bmr006
me011|big micro arrays.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|didn't they have something at cape?|Q|Bmr006
me013|they both have these you know big arrays on the wall.|S|Bmr006
me013|and you know if you could do that you've got microphones all over the place.|S|Bmr006
me011|very finely.|S|Bmr006
me013|uh you know tens of microphones.|S|Bmr006
me013|and and uh|F|Bmr006
me018|oh i saw a demo!|S|Bmr006
mn005|oh right oh yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|and if you do that then you can really get very nice uh kind of selectivity.|S|Bmr006
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|oh i saw one that was like a hundred microphones a ten by ten array.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|hundred.|S|Bmr006
me018|and you could in a noisy room they could have all kinds of noises and you can zoom right in on somebody.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|and they had very precision|D|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|right.|S|Bmr006
me013|pretty much yeah.|S|Bmr006
mn005|very complex uh yeah.|S|Bmr006
me011|it was all in software and they and you could pick out an individual beam and listen to it.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|that is cool.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|it was yeah it was interesting.|S|Bmr006
me013|but the reason why i haven't focused on that as the my first concern is because um i'm interested in what happens for people random people out in some random place where they're having an impromptu discussion.|S|Bmr006
me013|and you can't just always go well let's go to this heavily instrumented room that we spent tens of thousands of dollars to to set up.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|no what you need to do is you'd have a little fabric thing that you unroll and hang on a wall.|S|Bmr006
me018|it has all these mikes and it has a plug in jack to the p d a.|S|Bmr006
fe008|interesting.|S|Bmr006
me013|the other thing actually that gets at this a little bit of something else i'd like to do is what happens if you have two p d a's?|Q|Bmr006
me011|but i think|D|Bmr006
me011|yep.|B|Bmr006
me013|and they communicate with each other and then you know they're in random positions the likelihood that i mean basically there wouldn't be any likely to be any kind of nulls if you even had two if you had three or four it's yeah.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|ooo!|S|Bmr006
me011|that's on my web pages.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah.|F|Bmr006
me018|network.|S|Bmr006
fe008|interesting.|S|Bmr006
me011|though|D|Bmr006
me011|all sorts of interesting things you can do with that.|S|Bmr006
fe008|interesting.|S|Bmr006
me011|i mean not only can you do microphone arrays but you can do all sorts of um multi band as well.|S|Bmr006
fe008|huh.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|uh!|B|Bmr006
me011|so it's it would be neat.|S|Bmr006
me018|i still like my rug on the wall idea so if anybody patents that then|D|Bmr006
me011|but|F|Bmr006
me011|i think|F|Bmr006
fe008|well you could have strips that you stick to your clothing.|S|Bmr006
me011|in terms of|F|Bmr006
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|yeah!|S|Bmr006
me018|hats.|S|Bmr006
me011|in terms of the research research it's really it's whatever the person who is doing the research wants to do.|S|Bmr006
me018|shirts.|S|Bmr006
me011|so if if jose is interested in that that's great.|S|Bmr006
me011|but if if he's not that's great too.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|um i i i would actually kind of like us to wind it down see if we can still get to the end of the uh birthdays thing there.|S|Bmr006
me011|catch some tea?|Q|Bmr006
me011|um.|F|Bmr006
me013|so|F|Bmr006
me011|well i had a couple things that i did want to bring out.|S|Bmr006
me013|okay.|B|Bmr006
me011|one is do we need to sign new these again?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|well it's slightly different so i i would say it would be a good idea.|S|Bmr006
fe008|because it it's slightly different.|S|Bmr006
me018|are they new?|Q|Bmr006
me011|yep.|S|Bmr006
me018|oh.|S|Bmr006
me013|oh this morning we didn't sign anything because we said that if anybody had signed it already we didn't have to.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah i i should've checked with jane first but the the form has changed.|S|Bmr006
fe008|it's slightly different.|S|Bmr006
me013|uhoh.|F|Bmr006
me011|so we may want to have everyone sign the new form.|S|Bmr006
mn005|okay.|S|Bmr006
fe008|i had to make one|D|Bmr006
me011|um i had some things i wanted to talk about with the thresholding stuff i'm doing.|S|Bmr006
me011|but if we're in a hurry we can put that off.|S|Bmr006
me011|um and then also anonymity how we want to anonymize the data.|S|Bmr006
fe008|well should i i mean i have some results to present but i mean i guess we won't have time to do that this time.|S|Bmr006
me011|uh|F|Bmr006
fe008|but it seems like um the anonymization is uh is also something that we might want to discuss in greater length.|S|Bmr006
me013|um i mean what|D|Bmr006
fe008|if if we're about to wind down i think what i would prefer is that we uh delay the anonymization thing till next week.|S|Bmr006
fe008|and i would like to present the results that i have on the overlaps.|S|Bmr006
me018|we still have to do this too right?|S|Bmr006
me013|right.|S|Bmr006
me018|digits?|Q|Bmr006
me013|right.|S|Bmr006
me011|well we don't have to do digits.|S|Bmr006
me013|well why don't we|D|Bmr006
me013|uh so okay it sounds like uh there were there were a couple technical things people would like to talk about.|S|Bmr006
me013|why don't we just take a couple minutes to to briefly do them and then and then and then and then and then we|D|Bmr006
me011|okay go ahead jane.|S|Bmr006
fe008|i'd i'd prefer to have more time for my results.|S|Bmr006
fe008|could i do that next week maybe?|Q|Bmr006
me013|okay.|S|Bmr006
me013|oh yeah sure.|S|Bmr006
fe008|okay that's what i'm asking.|S|Bmr006
me013|oh yeah yeah.|S|Bmr006
fe008|and i think the anonymization if if you want to proceed with that now i just think that that's that's a discussion which also really deserves a a you know more that just a minute.|S|Bmr006
me013|we could|D|Bmr006
fe008|i really do think that.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|because you raised a couple of possibilities yourself.|S|Bmr006
fe008|you and i have discussed it previously.|S|Bmr006
fe008|and there are different ways that people approach it and i think we should|D|Bmr006
me011|all right.|B|Bmr006
me011|we're we're we're getting enough data now that i'd sort of like to do it now before i get overwhelmed with once we decide how to do it.|S|Bmr006
fe008|well okay.|F|Bmr006
me011|going and dealing with it.|S|Bmr006
fe008|it's just|D|Bmr006
fe008|yeah okay i i'll give you the short version.|S|Bmr006
fe008|but i do think it's an issue that we can't resolve in five minutes.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|okay so the the short thing is um we have uh tape recording uh uh sorry digitized recordings.|S|Bmr006
fe008|those we won't be able to change.|S|Bmr006
fe008|if someone says hey roger so-and-so.|S|Bmr006
me011|right.|B|Bmr006
fe008|so that's going to stay that person's name.|S|Bmr006
me011|yep.|B|Bmr006
fe008|now in terms of like the transcript.|S|Bmr006
fe008|the question becomes what symbol are you going to put in there for everybody's name?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|and whether you're going to put it in the text where he says hey roger or are we going to put that person's anonymized name in instead?|Q|Bmr006
me011|no because then that would give you a mapping and you don't want to have a mapping.|S|Bmr006
fe008|okay so first decision is we're going to anonymize the same name for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker's name is mentioned.|S|Bmr006
me011|no.|S|Bmr006
me018|i don't|D|Bmr006
me011|because that would give you a mapping between the speaker's real name and the tag we're using and we don't want|D|Bmr006
fe008|i i don't think you understood what i what i said.|S|Bmr006
me011|okay.|S|Bmr006
fe008|so uh so in within the context of an utterance someone says so roger what do you think.|S|Bmr006
fe008|okay.|F|Bmr006
fe008|then uh it seems to me that well maybe i uh it seems to me that if you change the name the transcript's going to disagree with the audio and you won't be able to use that.|S|Bmr006
me011|we don't we want to we we want the transcript to be roger.|S|Bmr006
me018|right you don't want to do that.|S|Bmr006
me011|because if we made the the transcript be the tag that we're using for roger someone who had the transcript and the audio would then have a mapping between the anonymized name and the real name and we want to avoid that.|S|Bmr006
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|okay well but then there's this issue of if we're going to use this for a discourse type of thing then and you know liz was mentioning stuff in a previous meeting about gaze direction and who's who's the addressee and all then to have roger be the thing in the utterance and then actually have the speaker identifier who was roger be frank that's going to be really confusing and make it pretty much useless for discourse analysis.|S|Bmr006
me011|oh.|S|Bmr006
me011|ugh.|S|Bmr006
me011|that's a good point.|S|Bmr006
fe008|now if you want to you know i mean in some cases i i i know that susan ervin tripp in some of hers uh actually did do uh um a filter of the signal where the person's name was mentioned except.|D|Bmr006
fe008|and and i and i so i mean the question then becomes one level back.|S|Bmr006
fe008|um how important is it for a person to be identified by first name versus full name?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|well on the one hand uh it's not a full identity.|S|Bmr006
fe008|we're taking all these precautions um and they'll be taking precautions which are probably even the more important ones to they'll be reviewing the transcripts to see if there's something they don't like okay.|S|Bmr006
fe008|so maybe uh maybe that's enough protection.|S|Bmr006
fe008|on the other hand this is a small this is a small pool and people who say things about topic x who are researchers and well known in the field they'll be identifiable and simply from the from the first name.|S|Bmr006
fe008|however taking one step further back they'd be identifiable anyway even if we changed all the names.|S|Bmr006
me011|right.|S|Bmr006
fe008|so is it really um you know|D|Bmr006
mn005|huh.|B|Bmr006
me011|ugh!|S|Bmr006
fe008|now in terms of like so i i did some results which i'll report on next time which do mention individual speakers by name.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|now there the human subjects committee is very precise.|S|Bmr006
fe008|you don't want to mention subjects by name in published reports.|S|Bmr006
fe008|now it would be very possible for me to take those data put them in a in a study and just change everybody's name for the purpose of the publication.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah once you get to the publication you can certainly do that.|S|Bmr006
fe008|and someone who looked|D|Bmr006
me013|you can go you know uh z uh for instance.|S|Bmr006
fe008|yeah exactly.|S|Bmr006
fe008|doesn't matter if|D|Bmr006
me013|uh um yeah i mean it doesn't i mean i'm not knowledgeable about this.|S|Bmr006
fe008|that's the same thing you saw.|S|Bmr006
me013|but it certainly doesn't bother me to have someone's first name in in the in the transcript.|S|Bmr006
me011|okay.|B|Bmr006
me013|uh i think you don't want to have their full name to be uh listed.|S|Bmr006
fe008|yeah and and in the form that they sign it does say your first name may arise in the course of the meetings.|S|Bmr006
me013|and so|D|Bmr006
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|well|F|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|so again the issue is if you're tracking discourse things you know if someone says uh uh frank said this and then you want to connect it to something later you've got to have this part where that's frank colon.|S|Bmr006
fe008|or your name.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah shoot!|S|Bmr006
me013|right?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|yeah and and you know even more uh immediate than that just being able to uh well it just seems like to track track from one utterance to the next utterance who's speaking and who's speaking to whom because that can be important.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|you know you raised the point so-and-so it's be kind of nice to be able to know who you was.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|shoot!|S|Bmr006
me011|i i'm thinking too much.|S|Bmr006
fe008|and and actually you remember furthermore you remember last time we had this discussion of how you know i was sort of avoiding mentioning people's names.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah i was too yeah.|S|Bmr006
fe008|and and it was and we made the decision that was kind of artificial.|S|Bmr006
fe008|well i mean if we're going to step in after the fact and change people's names in the transcript we've basically done something one step worse.|S|Bmr006
me011|yep.|B|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|well i would i i don't want to change the names in the transcript.|S|Bmr006
fe008|misleading.|S|Bmr006
me011|but that's because i'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse and so i think that's a really good point.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|you're right this is going to require more thought.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|let me just back up this to make a a brief comment about the uh what we're covering in the meeting.|S|Bmr006
me013|uh i realize when you're doing this that uh i mean i didn't realize that you had a bunch of things that you wanted to talk about.|S|Bmr006
me013|uh and so uh and so i was proceeding somewhat at random frankly.|S|Bmr006
me013|so i think what would be helpful would be uh and i'll i'll mention this to to liz and andreas too that um before the meeting if anybody could send me any any uh uh agenda items that they were interested in and i'll i'll take the role of organizing them uh into into the agenda.|S|Bmr006
fe008|okay.|B|Bmr006
fe008|sure.|B|Bmr006
me013|but i'd be very pleased to have everyone else completely make up the agenda.|S|Bmr006
me013|i've no desire to to make it up.|S|Bmr006
me013|but if if no one's told me things then i'm just proceeding from my my guesses and and uh and yeah i i'm sorry it ended up with your out your time to i mean i'm just always asking jose what he's doing you know and and so it's there's uh there's obviously other things going on.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|oh it's not a problem not a problem yeah.|S|Bmr006
fe008|i just i just couldn't do it in two minutes.|S|Bmr006
me011|how will we how would the person who's doing the transcript even know who they're talking about?|Q|Bmr006
me011|do you know what i'm saying?|Q|Bmr006
me018|the person who's doing the transcript the i b m people?|Q|Bmr006
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr006
me011|i mean so how is that information going to get labeled anyway?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|how do you mean who what they're who they're talking about?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|how do you mean?|Q|Bmr006
me011|i mean so if i'm saying in a meeting oh and bob by the way wanted wanted to do so-and-so|D|Bmr006
me018|they're just going to write bob on it or do|D|Bmr006
me011|if you're doing|D|Bmr006
me011|yeah they're just going to write bob.|S|Bmr006
me011|and so if you're if you're doing discourse analysis|D|Bmr006
fe008|they won't be able to change it themselves.|S|Bmr006
me013|what how are they going to do any of this?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|well i i'm betting we're going to have huge chunks that are just totally untranscribable by them.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah really.|S|Bmr006
me013|i mean they're going to say speaker one or speaker two or i mean i i|D|Bmr006
me011|well the current one they don't do speaker identity.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah i think|D|Bmr006
me018|they can't do that.|S|Bmr006
me011|because in naturally speaking or excuse me in via voice it's only one person.|S|Bmr006
me011|and so in their current conventions there are no multiple speaker conventions.|S|Bmr006
me013|so it may just be one long transcript of a bunch of words.|S|Bmr006
fe008|oh i think that my understanding from|D|Bmr006
me011|yep.|S|Bmr006
fe008|is it yen ching?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|is that how you pronounce her name?|Q|Bmr006
me013|uh yu ching yu ching yeah.|S|Bmr006
fe008|oh uh yu ching?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|yu ching?|Q|Bmr006
me011|yu-ching.|S|Bmr006
fe008|was that um they will that they will adopt the part of the conventions that that we discussed where they put speaker identifier down.|S|Bmr006
fe008|but you know they won't know these people .|S|Bmr006
fe008|so i think it's well they'll they'll adopt some convention.|S|Bmr006
fe008|but we haven't specified to them.|S|Bmr006
fe008|so they'll do something like speaker one speaker two is what.|S|Bmr006
fe008|i bet but i'm betting there'll be huge variations in the accuracy of of their labeling the speakers.|S|Bmr006
fe008|we'll have to review the transcripts in any case.|S|Bmr006
me013|and it and it may very well be i mean since they're not going to sit there and and and worry about uh it being the same speaker they may very well go the uh the the first the first time it changes to another speaker that'll be speaker two.|S|Bmr006
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|and the next time it'll be speaker three even if it's actually speaker one.|S|Bmr006
fe008|you know|D|Bmr006
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|you know that would be a very practical solution on their part.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|and and but then we would need to label it.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|it's a good idea.|S|Bmr006
fe008|and that's okay.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah we we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close talking mikes.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah yeah i think|D|Bmr006
fe008|yes i was thinking the the time values of when it changes.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|so but i mean that doesn't this doesn't answer the the question.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|but that|D|Bmr006
fe008|that'd be very efficient.|S|Bmr006
me011|the it's a good point which what do you do for discourse tracking.|S|Bmr006
mn005|because you don't know to know uh you don't need to know what what is the identification of the of the speakers you only uh want to know|D|Bmr006
me011|huh.|B|Bmr006
me011|for for acoustics you don't but for discourse you do.|S|Bmr006
me013|well you do.|S|Bmr006
mn005|uh for discourse yeah yeah yeah.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr006
me013|if if if if someone says uh what what is jose doing and then jose says something you need to know that that was jose responding.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah yeah yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me013|uh so.|F|Bmr006
me011|ugh that's a problem.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|unless we adopt a different set of norms which is to not to make a point of not identifying people by name which then leads you to be more contextually explicit.|S|Bmr006
me018|that would be hard.|S|Bmr006
fe008|well people are very flexible you know i mean so when we did this last week i felt that you know now andreas may uh uh he he sometimes people think of something else at the same time and they miss a sentence or something and and because he missed something then he missed the the initial introduction of who we were talking about and was was unable to do the tracking.|S|Bmr006
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|but i felt like most of us were doing the tracking and knew who we were talking about and we just weren't mentioning the name.|S|Bmr006
fe008|so people are really flexible.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|but you know like at the beginning of this meeting or you i think said you know or liz said something about um uh is mari going to use the equipment.|S|Bmr006
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr006
me018|i mean how would you say that?|Q|Bmr006
me018|i mean you have to really think you know about what you're saying|D|Bmr006
me011|if you wanted to anonymize.|S|Bmr006
me013|is you know who up in you know where?|Q|Bmr006
me018|yeah yeah.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me013|right use the|D|Bmr006
me018|i think it would be really hard if we made a policy where we didn't say names plus we'd have to tell everybody else.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah darn!|S|Bmr006
me011|i mean what i was going to say is that the other option is that we could bleep out the names.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah is|D|Bmr006
fe008|well|D|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|but then again that kills your discourse analysis.|S|Bmr006
me018|right.|S|Bmr006
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr006
fe008|that's that's the issue.|S|Bmr006
me018|i i think the i think i don't know my own two cents worth is that you don't do anything about what's in the recordings you only anonymize to the extent you can the speakers have signed the forms and all.|S|Bmr006
me011|well but that but that as i said that that that works great for the acoustics but it it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse.|S|Bmr006
fe008|well.|D|Bmr006
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|why?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|because you don't have a map of who's talking versus their name that they're being referred to.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|i thought we were going to get it labelled speaker one speaker two|D|Bmr006
me011|sure but then you have to know that jose is speaker one and|D|Bmr006
me018|why do you have to know his name?|Q|Bmr006
me013|okay so suppose someone says well i don't know if i really heard what uh what jose said.|S|Bmr006
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|and then jose responds.|S|Bmr006
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|and part of your learning about the dialogue is jose responding to it.|S|Bmr006
me013|but it doesn't say jose it says speaker five.|S|Bmr006
me018|okay.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|so uh|F|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|oh i see you want to associated the word jose in the dialogue with the fact that then he responded.|S|Bmr006
me013|right.|S|Bmr006
me013|and so if we pass out the data to someone else and it says speaker five there we also have to pass them this little guide that says that speaker five is jose.|S|Bmr006
me011|someone who's doing discourse would want to do that.|S|Bmr006
me013|and if were going to do that we might as well give them jose say it was jose.|S|Bmr006
me011|and that violates our privacy.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me011|and that violates our privacy issue.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|now i i think that we have these two phases in the in the data which is the one which is our use university of washington's use i b m s r i.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|and within that it may be that it's sufficient to not uh change the to not incorporate anonymization yet but always always in the publications we have to.|S|Bmr006
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
fe008|and i think also when we take it that next step and distribute it to the world we have to.|S|Bmr006
fe008|but i but i that's that's a long way from now and and it's a matter of between now and then of of deciding how.|S|Bmr006
me011|making some decisions.|S|Bmr006
fe008|it you know it may be that we'll need to do something like actually x out that part of the um the audio and just put in brackets speaker one.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|for the public one.|S|Bmr006
fe008|you know?|Q|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|you know what we could do also is have more than one version of release.|S|Bmr006
me011|one that's public and one one that requires licensing.|S|Bmr006
me011|and so the licensed one would we could it would be a sticky limitation.|S|Bmr006
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me011|you know like|D|Bmr006
fe008|i think that's risky i think that the public should be the same.|S|Bmr006
me011|well we can talk about that later.|S|Bmr006
fe008|i think that when we do that world release it should be the same.|S|Bmr006
me013|i i agree.|S|Bmr006
me013|i i agree with jane.|S|Bmr006
fe008|for a bunch of reasons legal.|S|Bmr006
me013|i i think that we we have a need to have a consistent licensing policy of some sort and|D|Bmr006
fe008|but i also think a consistent licensing policy is important.|S|Bmr006
mn005|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me018|well one thing to take into consideration is are there any um for example the people who are funding this work they want this work to get out and be useful for discourse.|S|Bmr006
me018|if we all of a sudden do this and then release it to the public and it's not longer useful for discourse.|S|Bmr006
me018|you know?|Q|Bmr006
me011|well depending on how much editing we do you might be able to still have it useful.|S|Bmr006
me011|because for discourse you don't need the audio.|S|Bmr006
me011|right?|Q|Bmr006
me011|so you could bleep out the names in the audio.|S|Bmr006
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me011|and use the anonymized one through the transcript.|S|Bmr006
fe008|excuse me we we do need audio for discourse.|S|Bmr006
me013|uh.|B|Bmr006
me018|but if you release both|D|Bmr006
me011|but excuse me but you could bleep out just the names.|S|Bmr006
me013|no but she's saying from the argument before she wants to be able to say if someone said jose in their in their thing and then connect to to what he said later then you need it.|S|Bmr006
me011|right.|S|Bmr006
me011|but in the transcript you could say everywhere they said jose that you could replace it with speaker seven.|S|Bmr006
me013|oh i see.|S|Bmr006
fe008|yeah but i i also want to say that people|D|Bmr006
me013|i see.|S|Bmr006
me011|and then it wouldn't meet match the audio anymore.|S|Bmr006
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr006
me011|but it would be still useful for the|D|Bmr006
me018|but if both of those are publically available|D|Bmr006
fe008|yeah that's good.|S|Bmr006
me011|but they|D|Bmr006
me011|right.|S|Bmr006
me013|and and the other thing is if if if liz were here what she might say is that she wants to look if things that cut across between the audio and the dialogue.|S|Bmr006
fe008|well you see so it's complicated.|S|Bmr006
me013|and so uh|F|Bmr006
fe008|uhhuh yeah.|B|Bmr006
fe008|i think we have to think about how i think that this can't be decided today.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah sorry.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah okay good point.|S|Bmr006
fe008|but it's but i think it was good to introduce the thing and we can do it next time.|S|Bmr006
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me013|okay.|F|Bmr006
me011|i didn't think when i wrote you that email i wasn't thinking it was a big can of worms but i guess it is.|S|Bmr006
mn005|okay.|B|Bmr006
me013|yeah a lot of these things are.|S|Bmr006
me011|discourse.|S|Bmr006
fe008|well it discourse you know also i wanted to make the point that that discourse is going to be more than just looking at a transcript.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah absolutely.|B|Bmr006
fe008|it's going to be looking at a you know and prosodic stuff is involved.|S|Bmr006
me011|oh yeah sure.|B|Bmr006
fe008|and that means you're going to be listening to the audio.|S|Bmr006
fe008|and then you come directly into this confronting this problem.|S|Bmr006
me018|maybe we should just not allow anybody to do research on discourse.|S|Bmr006
fe008|so|F|Bmr006
me018|and then we wouldn't have to worry about it.|S|Bmr006
mn005|okay.|B|Bmr006
fe008|yeah we should just market it to non english speaking countries.|S|Bmr006
me013|uh maybe we should only have meetings between people who don't know one another and who are also amnesiacs who don't know their own name.|S|Bmr006
mn005|okay.|B|Bmr006
me011|did you read the paper on eurospeech?|Q|Bmr006
fe008|we could have little labels.|S|Bmr006
fe008|i i i want to introduce my reservoir dogs solution again which is everyone has like mister white mister pink mister blue.|S|Bmr006
me018|mister white.|S|Bmr006
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr006
me011|did you read the paper a few years ago where they were reversing the syllables?|Q|Bmr006
me011|they were they had the utterances.|S|Bmr006
me011|and they would extract out the syllables and they would play them backwards.|S|Bmr006
me018|but so the syllables were in the same order with respect to each other but the|D|Bmr006
me011|everything was in the same order but they were the individual syllables were played backwards.|S|Bmr006
me011|and you could listen to it and it would sound the same.|S|Bmr006
me018|what did it sound like?|Q|Bmr006
me011|people had no difficulty interpreting it.|S|Bmr006
me011|so what we need is something that's the reverse that a speech recognizer works exactly the same on it but people can't understand it.|S|Bmr006
me013|oh well that's there's an easy way to do that.|S|Bmr006
me013|just play it all backwards.|S|Bmr006
me011|oh right the speech recognizer's totally symmetric isn't it.|S|Bmr006
me013|what what does the speech recognizer care?|Q|Bmr006
me011|uh anyway.|F|Bmr006
me013|um|F|Bmr006
fe008|oh do we do digits or|D|Bmr006
fe008|what do we do?|Q|Bmr006
me013|let's do digits.|S|Bmr006
me011|uh okay we'll quickly do digits.|S|Bmr006
fe008|or do we just quit?|Q|Bmr006
me013|yeah we we we already missed the party.|S|Bmr006
me013|so|F|Bmr006
me011|okay.|S|Bmr006
fe008|yeah.|D|Bmr006
