me013|i was saying hynek will be here next week.|S|Bro016
me013|uh wednesday through friday.|S|Bro016
me013|uh through saturday.|S|Bro016
me013|and um|F|Bro016
me013|i won't be here thursday and friday.|S|Bro016
me013|but my suggestion is that uh at least for this meeting people should go ahead.|S|Bro016
me013|uh because hynek will be here.|S|Bro016
me013|and|D|Bro016
me013|you know we don't have any czech accent yet.|S|Bro016
me013|uh as far as i know.|S|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me018|okay.|S|Bro016
me013|there we go.|S|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|so other than reading digits what's our agenda?|Q|Bro016
me018|i don't really have uh anything new.|S|Bro016
me018|been working on meeting recorder stuff.|S|Bro016
me018|so|F|Bro016
me013|okay.|S|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|do you think that would be the case for next week also?|Q|Bro016
me013|or is is uh|D|Bro016
me013|what's your projection on|D|Bro016
me018|um|F|Bro016
me013|because the one thing the one thing that seems to me we really should try if you hadn't tried it before because it hadn't occurred to me.|S|Bro016
me013|it was sort of an obvious thing.|S|Bro016
me013|is um adjusting the uh the scaling and uh insertion penalty sort of stuff.|S|Bro016
me018|i did play with that actually a little bit.|S|Bro016
me018|um what happens is uh when you get to the noisy stuff you start getting lots of insertions.|S|Bro016
me013|right.|S|Bro016
me018|and um|F|Bro016
me018|so i've tried playing around a little bit with um the insertion penalties and things like that.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|S|Bro016
me018|um|F|Bro016
me018|i mean it it didn't make a whole lot of difference.|S|Bro016
me018|like for the well matched case it seemed like it was pretty good.|S|Bro016
me018|um i could do more playing with that though.|S|Bro016
me018|and uh|F|Bro016
me018|and see.|S|Bro016
me013|but you were looking at mel cepstrum.|S|Bro016
me018|yes.|S|Bro016
me013|right.|S|Bro016
me018|oh you're talking about for for our features.|S|Bro016
me013|right.|S|Bro016
me013|so i mean it's not the direction that you were working with that we were saying what's the uh what's the best you can do with with mel cepstrum.|S|Bro016
me018|huh.|B|Bro016
me013|but they raised a very valid point.|S|Bro016
me013|which i guess|D|Bro016
me013|so to first order i mean you have other things you were going to do.|S|Bro016
me013|but to first order i would say that the conclusion is that if you um do uh some monkeying around with uh the exact h t k training and with uh you know how many states and so forth that it it doesn't particularly improve the performance.|S|Bro016
me013|in other words that even though it sounds pretty dumb just applying the same number of states to everything more or less no matter what language isn't so bad.|S|Bro016
me013|right?|Q|Bro016
me013|and i guess you hadn't gotten to all the experiments you wanted to do with number of gaussians.|S|Bro016
me018|right.|S|Bro016
me013|but um|F|Bro016
me013|let's just|D|Bro016
me013|if we had to if we had to draw a conclusion on the information we have so far we'd say something like that.|S|Bro016
me013|right?|Q|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|uh so the next question to ask which is i think the one that that that andreas was addressing himself to in the lunch meeting is um we're not supposed to adjust the back end.|S|Bro016
me013|but anybody using the system would.|S|Bro016
me018|yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me013|if you were just adjusting the back end how much better would you do uh in noise?|Q|Bro016
me013|uh because the language scaling and insertion penalties and so forth are probably set to be about right for mel cepstrum.|S|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|S|Bro016
me013|but um they're probably not at all set right for these things.|S|Bro016
me013|particularly these things that look over uh larger time windows in one way or another with with l d a and k l t and neural nets and all these things.|S|Bro016
me013|in the past we've always found that we had to increase the insertion penalty to to correspond to such things.|S|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me013|i think that's uh that's kind of a first order thing that that we should try.|S|Bro016
me018|so for|D|Bro016
me018|so the experiment is to um run our front end like normal with the default uh insertion penalties and so forth.|S|Bro016
me018|and then tweak that a little bit.|S|Bro016
me018|and see how much of a difference it makes.|S|Bro016
me013|so by our front end i mean take you know the aurora two take some version that stephane has that is you know our current best version of something.|S|Bro016
me018|if we were|D|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|i mean don't want to do this over a hundred different things that they've tried.|S|Bro016
me013|but you know for some version that you say is a good one.|S|Bro016
me013|you know?|Q|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|how how much uh does it improve if you actually adjust that?|Q|Bro016
me018|okay.|S|Bro016
me013|but it is interesting.|S|Bro016
me013|you say you you have for the noisy|D|Bro016
me013|how about for the for the mismatched or or or or the or the medium mismatched conditions?|Q|Bro016
me013|have you|D|Bro016
me013|when you adjusted those numbers for mel cepstrum did it|D|Bro016
me018|uh i i don't remember off the top of my head.|S|Bro016
me018|um|F|Bro016
me018|yeah i didn't even write them down.|S|Bro016
me018|i i i don't remember.|S|Bro016
me018|i would need to|D|Bro016
me018|well i did write down|D|Bro016
me018|um|F|Bro016
me018|so when i was doing i just wrote down some numbers for the well matched case.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|S|Bro016
me018|um|F|Bro016
me018|looking at the i wrote down what the deletions substitutions and insertions were.|S|Bro016
me018|uh|F|Bro016
me018|for different numbers of states per phone.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
me018|um but uh that that's all i wrote down.|S|Bro016
me013|okay.|S|Bro016
me018|so|F|Bro016
me018|i i would|D|Bro016
me018|yeah.|S|Bro016
me018|i would need to do that.|S|Bro016
me013|okay.|S|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me018|i can do that for next week.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|and um|F|Bro016
me013|yeah.|F|Bro016
me013|also uh uh sometimes if you run behind on some of these things maybe we can get someone else to do it.|S|Bro016
me013|and you can supervise or something.|S|Bro016
me013|but|F|Bro016
me013|but i think it would be it'd be good to know that.|S|Bro016
me018|okay.|S|Bro016
me018|i just need to get um front end uh stuff from you.|S|Bro016
mn007|huh.|B|Bro016
me018|or you point me to some files that you've already calculated.|S|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro016
mn007|all right.|S|Bro016
me013|okay.|B|Bro016
me013|uh|B|Bro016
me018|i probably will have time to do that and time to play a little bit with the silence model.|S|Bro016
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me018|so maybe i can have that for next week when hynek's here.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|because i mean the the other|D|Bro016
me013|that in fact might have been part of what uh the difference was.|S|Bro016
me013|at least part of it that that we were seeing.|S|Bro016
me013|remember we were seeing the s r i system was so much better than the tandem system.|S|Bro016
me018|huh.|B|Bro016
me013|part of it might just be that the s r i system they they they always adjust these things to be sort of optimized.|S|Bro016
me018|is there|D|Bro016
me013|and|D|Bro016
me018|i wonder if there's anything that we could do to the front end that would affect the insertion.|S|Bro016
me013|yes.|S|Bro016
me013|i think you can.|S|Bro016
me018|what could you do?|Q|Bro016
me013|well um|F|Bro016
me013|uh|F|Bro016
me013|part of what's going on um is the uh the range of values.|S|Bro016
me013|so if you have something that has a much smaller range or a much larger range and taking the appropriate root.|S|Bro016
me018|oh!|S|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|you know?|Q|Bro016
me013|if something is kind of like the equivalent of a bunch of probabilities multiplied together you can take a root of some sort.|S|Bro016
me013|if it's like seven probabilities together you can take the seventh root of it or something.|S|Bro016
me013|or if it's in the log domain divide it by seven.|S|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|but|D|Bro016
me013|but|D|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|that has a similar effect.|S|Bro016
me013|because it changes the scale of the numbers of the differences between different candidates from the acoustic model.|S|Bro016
me018|oh.|S|Bro016
me018|right.|S|Bro016
me013|as opposed to what's coming from the language model.|S|Bro016
me018|so that|D|Bro016
me018|right.|S|Bro016
me018|so in effect that's changing the value of your insertion penalty.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|i mean it's more directly like the the language scaling or the uh the model scaling or acoustic scaling.|S|Bro016
me018|that's interesting.|S|Bro016
me013|but you know that those things have kind of a similar effect to the insertion penalty.|S|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|anyway they're a slightly different way of of handling it.|S|Bro016
me018|right.|S|Bro016
me013|so um|F|Bro016
me018|so if we know what the insertion penalty is then we can get an idea about what range our number should be in.|S|Bro016
me018|so that they match with that.|S|Bro016
me013|i think so.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|so that's why i think|D|Bro016
me013|that's another reason other than curiosity as to why it would in fact be kind of neat to find out if we're way off.|S|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|i mean the other thing is aren't we seeing|D|Bro016
me013|i'm sure you've already looked at this.|S|Bro016
me013|in these noisy cases are we are seeing lots of insertions.|S|Bro016
me013|right?|Q|Bro016
me013|the insertion number is quite high?|Q|Bro016
me013|i know the v a d takes care of part of that.|S|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro016
me018|yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|but|D|Bro016
me018|i've seen that with the mel cepstrum.|S|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro016
me018|i don't i don't know about the aurora front end.|S|Bro016
me018|but|D|Bro016
mn007|i think it's much more balanced with uh when the front end is more robust.|S|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro016
mn007|i could look at it at this.|S|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro016
me013|yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|what's a typical number?|Q|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
mn007|i don't i don't know.|S|Bro016
me013|do we|D|Bro016
me013|oh you oh you don't know.|S|Bro016
me013|okay.|S|Bro016
mn007|i don't have this in|D|Bro016
me013|i'm sure it's more balanced.|S|Bro016
me013|but it it it wouldn't surprise me if there's still|D|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|i mean in in the the the old systems we used to do i i uh i remember numbers kind of like insertions being half the number of deletions as being and both numbers being tend to be on the small side comparing to to uh substitutions.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me018|well this|D|Bro016
me018|the whole problem with insertions was what i think um we talked about when the guy from o g i came down that one time.|S|Bro016
me018|and|D|Bro016
me018|and that was when people were saying well we should have a uh uh voice activity detector.|S|Bro016
me013|right.|S|Bro016
me018|that because all that stuff that we're getting the silence that's getting through is causing insertions.|S|Bro016
me018|so|F|Bro016
me013|right.|B|Bro016
mn007|huh.|B|Bro016
me018|i'll bet you there's still a lot of insertions.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|yeah.|F|Bro016
me013|and it may be less of a critical thing.|S|Bro016
me013|i mean the fact that some get by may be less of a critical thing if you uh get things in the right range.|S|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|so i mean the insertions is is a symptom.|S|Bro016
me013|it's a symptom that there's something uh wrong with the range.|S|Bro016
me018|right.|B|Bro016
me013|but there's uh your your your substitutions tend to go up as well.|S|Bro016
me013|so uh i i i think that|D|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|uh the most obvious thing is just the insertions.|S|Bro016
me013|but|F|Bro016
me013|uh|F|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|if you're operating in the wrong range i mean that's why just in general if you change what these these penalties and scaling factors are you reach some point that's a that's a minimum.|S|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|we do have to do well over a range of different conditions.|S|Bro016
me013|some of which are noisier than others.|S|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|but um i think we may get a better handle on that if we if we see|D|Bro016
me013|um i mean we|D|Bro016
me013|it's if we actually could pick a a a more stable value for the range of these features it um uh could|D|Bro016
me013|uh|F|Bro016
me013|even though it's it's it's true that in a real situation you can in fact adjust the these these scaling factors in the back end and it's artificial here that we're not adjusting those you certainly don't want to be adjusting those all the time.|S|Bro016
me018|huh.|B|Bro016
me013|and if you have a nice front end that's in roughly the right range.|S|Bro016
me013|i remember after we got our stuff more or less together in the previous systems we built that we tended to set those scaling factors at kind of a standard level.|S|Bro016
me013|and we would rarely adjust them again.|S|Bro016
me013|even though you could get a|D|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|for an evaluation you can get an extra point or something if you tweaked it a little bit.|S|Bro016
me013|but|F|Bro016
me013|once we knew what roughly the right operating range was it was pretty stable.|S|Bro016
me013|and uh we might just not even be in the right operating range.|S|Bro016
me018|so would the|D|Bro016
me018|uh would a good idea be to try to map it into the same range that you get in the well matched case?|Q|Bro016
me018|so if we computed what the range was in well matched and then when we get our noisy conditions out we try to make it have the same range as|D|Bro016
me013|no you don't want to change it for different conditions.|S|Bro016
me013|no.|S|Bro016
me013|no.|S|Bro016
me013|i i i what what i'm saying|D|Bro016
me018|oh i wasn't suggesting change it for different conditions.|S|Bro016
me018|i was just saying that when we pick a range we we want to pick a range that we map our numbers into.|S|Bro016
me018|we should probably pick it based on the range that we get in the well matched case.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
me018|otherwise i mean what range are we going to choose?|Q|Bro016
me018|to to map everything into.|S|Bro016
me013|well it depends how much we want to do gamesmanship and how much we want to do|D|Bro016
me013|i mean if|D|Bro016
me013|it to me actually even if you want to be play on the gamesmanship side it can be kind of tricky.|S|Bro016
me013|so i mean what you would do is set the set the scaling factors uh so that you got the best number for this point four five times the you know and so on.|S|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|but they might change that.|S|Bro016
me013|those weightings.|S|Bro016
me018|yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me013|uh|F|Bro016
me013|i just sort of think we need to explore the space.|S|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|just take a look at it a little bit.|S|Bro016
me018|okay.|B|Bro016
me013|and we we we may just find that that we're way off.|S|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|maybe we're not.|S|Bro016
me013|you know.|F|Bro016
me013|as for these other things it may turn out that uh it's kind of reasonable.|S|Bro016
me013|but then|D|Bro016
me013|i mean andreas gave a very reasonable response.|S|Bro016
me013|and he's probably not going to be the only one who's going to say this in the future.|S|Bro016
me013|of you know|D|Bro016
me013|people people within this tight knit community who are doing this evaluation are accepting uh more or less that these are the rules.|S|Bro016
me018|yeah.|B|Bro016
me013|but people outside of it who look in at the broader picture are certainly going to say well wait a minute you're doing all this standing on your head uh on the front end.|S|Bro016
me013|when all you could do is just adjust this in the back end with one one knob.|S|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|and|D|Bro016
me013|so we have to at least i think determine that that's not true.|S|Bro016
me013|which would be okay.|S|Bro016
me013|or determine that it is true.|S|Bro016
me013|in which case we want to adjust that.|S|Bro016
me013|and then continue with with what we're doing.|S|Bro016
me018|right.|B|Bro016
me013|and as you say as you point out finding ways to then compensate for that in the front end also then becomes a priority for this particular test.|S|Bro016
me013|and saying you don't have to do that.|S|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me013|okay.|F|Bro016
me013|so uh|F|Bro016
me013|what's new with you?|Q|Bro016
mn007|uh|F|Bro016
mn007|so there's nothing new.|S|Bro016
me013|uh what's old with you that's developed?|Q|Bro016
mn007|um.|F|Bro016
mn007|i'm sorry?|Q|Bro016
me013|you|D|Bro016
me013|okay.|S|Bro016
me013|what's old with you that has developed over the last week or two?|Q|Bro016
mn007|huh.|F|Bro016
mn007|well so we've been mainly working on the report.|S|Bro016
mn007|and and|F|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro016
me018|mainly working on what?|Q|Bro016
mn007|on the report of the work that was already done.|S|Bro016
me018|oh.|S|Bro016
mn007|um|F|Bro016
me018|how about that|D|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|F|Bro016
mn007|that's all.|S|Bro016
me018|anything new on the thing that uh you were working on with the uh|D|Bro016
fn002|i don't have results yet.|S|Bro016
me018|no results.|S|Bro016
me018|yeah.|F|Bro016
me013|what was that?|Q|Bro016
me018|the the|D|Bro016
me018|uh|F|Bro016
me006|voicing thing.|S|Bro016
me018|voicing detector.|S|Bro016
me013|i mean what's what's going on now?|Q|Bro016
me013|what are you doing?|Q|Bro016
fn002|uh to try to found nnn robust feature for detect between voice and unvoice.|S|Bro016
fn002|and we we try to use the variance of the difference between the f f t spectrum and mel filter bank spectrum.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
fn002|uh also the another parameter is relates with the auto correlation function.|S|Bro016
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
fn002|r energy and the variance also of the auto correlation function.|S|Bro016
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|so that's|D|Bro016
me013|yeah that's what you were describing i guess a week or two ago.|S|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro016
fn002|but we don't have we don't have result of the for aurora yet.|S|Bro016
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
fn002|we need to train the neural network.|S|Bro016
fn002|and|F|Bro016
me013|so you're training neural networks now?|Q|Bro016
fn002|no.|S|Bro016
fn002|not yet.|S|Bro016
me013|so what what's going on?|Q|Bro016
fn002|well we work in the report too.|S|Bro016
fn002|because we have a lot of result.|S|Bro016
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
fn002|they are very dispersed.|S|Bro016
fn002|and was necessary to to look in all the directory to to to give some more structure.|S|Bro016
me013|so so|F|Bro016
me013|yeah.|F|Bro016
me013|if i can summarize basically what's going on is that you're going over a lot of material that you have generated in furious fashion.|S|Bro016
me013|generating many results and doing many experiments.|S|Bro016
me013|and trying to pull it together into some coherent form to be able to see see what happens.|S|Bro016
fn002|huh huh.|B|Bro016
mn007|uh|F|Bro016
mn007|yeah basically we've stopped uh experimenting.|S|Bro016
me013|yes?|Q|Bro016
mn007|i mean we're just writing some kind of technical report.|S|Bro016
mn007|and|F|Bro016
me018|is this a report that's for aurora?|Q|Bro016
me018|or is it just like a tech report for icsi?|Q|Bro016
fn002|no.|S|Bro016
me018|or|D|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro016
fn002|for icsi.|S|Bro016
me018|uh.|S|Bro016
me018|i see.|S|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro016
fn002|just summary of the experiment and the conclusion.|S|Bro016
fn002|and|D|Bro016
fn002|something like that.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|okay.|F|Bro016
me013|so my suggestion though is that you you not necessarily finish that.|S|Bro016
me013|but that you put it all together so that it's you've got you've got a clearer structure to it.|S|Bro016
me013|you know what things are.|S|Bro016
me013|you have things documented.|S|Bro016
me013|you've looked things up that you needed to look up.|S|Bro016
me013|so that you know so that such a thing can be written.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|and um|F|Bro016
me013|when when when do you leave again?|Q|Bro016
fn002|uh in july.|S|Bro016
fn002|first of july.|S|Bro016
me013|first of july.|S|Bro016
me013|okay.|S|Bro016
me013|and that you figure on actually finishing it in in june.|S|Bro016
me013|because you know you're going to have another bunch of results to fit in there anyway.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
fn002|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|and right now it's kind of important that we actually go forward with experiments.|S|Bro016
fn002|it's not|D|Bro016
me013|so so i i think it's good to pause and to gather everything together and make sure it's in good shape.|S|Bro016
me013|so that other people can get access to it.|S|Bro016
me013|and so that it can go into a report in june.|S|Bro016
me013|but i think to to really work on on fine tuning the report at this point is is probably bad timing i i think.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro016
mn007|well we didn't|D|Bro016
mn007|we just planned to work on it one week on this report.|S|Bro016
mn007|not no more anyway.|S|Bro016
mn007|um|F|Bro016
me013|but you you may really want to add other things later anyway.|S|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|because you|D|Bro016
mn007|huh.|B|Bro016
me013|there's more to go?|Q|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro016
mn007|well|F|Bro016
mn007|so i don't know there are small things that we started to to do.|S|Bro016
mn007|but|D|Bro016
me018|are you discovering anything uh that makes you scratch your head as you write this report?|Q|Bro016
me018|like why did we do that.|S|Bro016
me018|or why didn't we do this.|S|Bro016
mn007|uh|F|Bro016
me018|or|F|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro016
mn007|and|D|Bro016
mn007|actually there were some tables that were also with partial results.|S|Bro016
mn007|we just noticed that.|S|Bro016
mn007|while gathering the result that for some conditions we didn't have everything.|S|Bro016
me018|huh.|B|Bro016
mn007|but anyway.|F|Bro016
mn007|um|F|Bro016
mn007|yeah yeah.|F|Bro016
mn007|we have yeah extracted actually the noises from the speechdat car.|S|Bro016
mn007|and so|F|Bro016
mn007|we can train neural network with speech and these noises.|S|Bro016
mn007|um|F|Bro016
mn007|it's difficult to say what it will give.|S|Bro016
mn007|because when we look at the aurora the t i digits experiments um they have these three conditions that have different noises.|S|Bro016
mn007|and apparently this system perform as well on the seen noises on the unseen noises and on the seen noises.|S|Bro016
mn007|but|D|Bro016
mn007|i think this is something we have to try anyway.|S|Bro016
mn007|so|F|Bro016
mn007|adding the noises from from the speechdat car.|S|Bro016
mn007|um|F|Bro016
me013|that's|D|Bro016
me013|that's uh|D|Bro016
me013|that's permitted?|Q|Bro016
mn007|uh|F|Bro016
mn007|well|F|Bro016
mn007|o g i does did that.|S|Bro016
mn007|um|F|Bro016
mn007|at some point they did that for for the voice activity detector.|S|Bro016
fn002|uh for a v a d.|S|Bro016
mn007|right?|Q|Bro016
mn007|um|F|Bro016
me018|could you say it again.|S|Bro016
me018|what what exactly did they do?|Q|Bro016
mn007|they used some parts of the um italian database to train the voice activity detector i think.|S|Bro016
mn007|it|D|Bro016
me013|yeah i guess the thing is|D|Bro016
me013|yeah.|F|Bro016
me013|i guess that's a matter of interpretation.|S|Bro016
me013|the rules as i understand it is that in principle the italian and the spanish and the english|D|Bro016
me013|no.|S|Bro016
me013|italian and the finnish and the english were development data.|S|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro016
mn007|and spanish yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|on which you could adjust things.|S|Bro016
me013|and the and the german and danish were the evaluation data.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|and then when they finally actually evaluated things they used everything.|S|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro016
mn007|that's right.|S|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
mn007|uh|F|Bro016
me013|uh|F|Bro016
me013|and it is true that the performance uh on the german was|D|Bro016
me013|i mean even though the improvement wasn't so good the the raw performance was really pretty good.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me013|and uh|F|Bro016
me013|it it doesn't appear that there's strong evidence that even though things were somewhat tuned on those three or four languages that that going to a different language really hurt you.|S|Bro016
me013|and the noises were not exactly the same.|S|Bro016
me013|right?|Q|Bro016
me013|because it was taken from a different|D|Bro016
me013|uh|F|Bro016
me013|i mean they were different drives.|S|Bro016
mn007|different cars.|S|Bro016
me013|i mean it was it was actual different cars and so on.|S|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me013|um it's somewhat tuned.|S|Bro016
me013|it's tuned more than you know a a a a|D|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|you'd really like to have something that needed no particular noise at all.|S|Bro016
me013|maybe just some white noise or something like that at most.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|but that's not really what this contest is.|S|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me013|um i guess it's okay.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me018|i think it's|D|Bro016
me013|that's something i'd like to understand before we actually use something from it.|S|Bro016
me013|because it would|D|Bro016
me018|it's probably something that huh the you know the uh experiment designers didn't really think about.|S|Bro016
me018|because i think most people aren't doing trained systems or you know uh systems that are like ours where you actually use the data to build models.|S|Bro016
me018|i mean they just doing signal processing.|S|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro016
me018|so|F|Bro016
me013|well it's true.|S|Bro016
me013|except that uh that's what we used in aurora one.|S|Bro016
me013|and then they designed the things for aurora two knowing that we were doing that.|S|Bro016
me018|yeah.|S|Bro016
me018|that's true.|S|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me018|and they didn't forbid us.|S|Bro016
me018|right?|Q|Bro016
me018|to build models on the data?|Q|Bro016
me013|no.|S|Bro016
me013|but i think i think that it it|D|Bro016
me013|it probably would be the case that if say we trained on italian uh data and then uh we tested on danish data and it did terribly uh that that it would look bad.|S|Bro016
me013|and i think someone would notice.|S|Bro016
me013|and would say well look this is not generalizing.|S|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|i would hope i would hope they would.|S|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|but uh|F|Bro016
me013|it's true.|S|Bro016
me013|you know maybe there's parameters that other people have used.|S|Bro016
me013|you know that they have tuned in some way for other things.|S|Bro016
me013|so it's it's uh|D|Bro016
me013|we should we should|D|Bro016
me013|maybe that's maybe a topic.|S|Bro016
me013|especially if you talk with him when i'm not here.|S|Bro016
me013|that's a topic you should discuss with hynek.|S|Bro016
me013|to you know double check it's okay.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me018|do we know anything about the speakers for each of the uh training utterances?|Q|Bro016
mn007|what do you mean?|Q|Bro016
me018|do you have speaker information?|Q|Bro016
mn007|we we|D|Bro016
me013|social security number.|S|Bro016
me018|that would be good.|S|Bro016
mn007|like we have male female.|S|Bro016
me018|bank pin.|S|Bro016
fn002|huh.|B|Bro016
me018|just male female?|Q|Bro016
mn007|at least.|S|Bro016
mn007|huh.|B|Bro016
me013|what kind of information do you mean?|Q|Bro016
me018|well i was thinking about things like you know gender uh you know gender specific nets and uh vocal tract length normalization.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me018|things like that.|S|Bro016
me018|i i don't i didn't know what information we have about the speakers that we could try to take advantage of.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|huh.|B|Bro016
me013|uh|F|Bro016
me013|right.|F|Bro016
me013|i mean again if you had the whole system you were optimizing that would be easy to see.|S|Bro016
me013|but if you're supposedly just using a fixed back end and you're just coming up with a feature vector i'm not sure|D|Bro016
me013|i mean having the two nets suppose you detected that it was male it was female you come up with different|D|Bro016
me018|well you could put them both in as separate streams or something.|S|Bro016
me018|uh|F|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|maybe.|S|Bro016
me018|i don't know.|S|Bro016
me018|i was just wondering if there was other information we could exploit.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|huh.|B|Bro016
me013|yeah it's an interesting thought.|S|Bro016
me013|maybe having something along the|D|Bro016
me013|i mean you can't really do vocal tract normalization.|S|Bro016
me013|but something that had some of that effect.|S|Bro016
me018|yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|being applied to the data in some way.|S|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
mn007|do you have something simple in mind for i mean vocal tract length normalization?|Q|Bro016
me018|uh no i hadn't i hadn't thought it was thought too much about it really.|S|Bro016
me018|it just something that popped into my head just now.|S|Bro016
me018|and so i i|D|Bro016
me018|i mean you could maybe use the ideas a similar idea to what they do in vocal tract length normalization.|S|Bro016
me018|you know you have some sort of a uh general speech model.|S|Bro016
me018|you know maybe just a mixture of gaussians that you evaluate every utterance against.|S|Bro016
me018|and then you see where each you know utterance like the likelihood of each utterance you divide the the range of the likelihoods up into discrete bins.|S|Bro016
me018|and then each bin's got some knob uh setting.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah but just listen to yourself.|S|Bro016
me013|i mean that uh really doesn't sound like a real time thing with less than two hundred milliseconds uh latency that and where you're not adjusting the statistical engine at all.|S|Bro016
me018|yeah.|B|Bro016
me018|yeah.|B|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me018|yeah.|B|Bro016
me018|that's true.|B|Bro016
me018|right.|B|Bro016
me013|you know that just|D|Bro016
mn007|huh.|B|Bro016
me018|could be expensive.|S|Bro016
me013|i mean.|F|Bro016
me013|yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|no|D|Bro016
me013|well not just expensive.|S|Bro016
me013|i i i don't see how you could possibly do it.|S|Bro016
me013|you can't look at the whole utterance and do anything you know you can only|D|Bro016
me018|oh!|S|Bro016
me013|right?|Q|Bro016
me018|right.|S|Bro016
me013|each frame comes in and it's got to go out the other end.|S|Bro016
me018|right.|S|Bro016
me013|so uh|F|Bro016
me018|so whatever it was it would have to be uh sort of on a per frame basis.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|i mean you can do|D|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me018|yeah.|B|Bro016
me013|fairly quickly you can do male female male female stuff.|S|Bro016
me018|yeah.|B|Bro016
me013|but as far as|D|Bro016
me013|i mean like i thought b b n did a thing with uh uh vocal tract normalization a ways back.|S|Bro016
me013|maybe other people did too.|S|Bro016
me013|with with uh uh trying to identify third formant average third formant using that as an indicator of|D|Bro016
me018|i don't know.|S|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me013|you know third formant|D|Bro016
me013|if you imagine that to first order what happens with uh changing vocal tract is that uh the formants get moved out by some proportion.|S|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|so if you had a first formant that was one hundred hertz before if the fifty if the vocal tract is fifty percent shorter then it would be out at seven fifty hertz.|S|Bro016
me013|and so on.|S|Bro016
me013|so that's a move of two hundred fifty hertz.|S|Bro016
me013|whereas the third formant which might have started off at twenty five hundred hertz you know might be out to thirty seven fifty.|S|Bro016
me013|you know so it's at|D|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me013|although you frequently get less distinct higher formants it's still third formant's kind of a reasonable compromise.|S|Bro016
me013|and|F|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|so i think uh if i recall correctly they did something like that.|S|Bro016
me018|huh.|B|Bro016
me013|and and|F|Bro016
me013|but um that doesn't work for just having one frame or something.|S|Bro016
me018|yeah.|B|Bro016
me013|you know that's more like looking at third formant over over a turn or something like that.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|and|D|Bro016
me018|right.|B|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me013|but on the other hand male female is a is a is a much simpler categorization than figuring out a a factor to uh squish or expand the the spectrum.|S|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|so um|F|Bro016
me013|you could imagine that|D|Bro016
me013|i mean just like we're saying voiced unvoiced is good to know.|S|Bro016
me013|uh male female is good to know also.|S|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|but you'd have to figure out a way to to to uh incorporate it on the fly.|S|Bro016
me013|uh i mean i guess as you say one thing you could do is simply uh have the the male and female output vectors you know nets trained only on males and trained only on females.|S|Bro016
me013|or|D|Bro016
me013|or uh|F|Bro016
me013|you know.|F|Bro016
me013|but|D|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|i don't know if that would really help.|S|Bro016
me013|because you already have males and females.|S|Bro016
me013|and it's uhhuh putting into one net.|S|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me013|is it|D|Bro016
me018|is it balanced?|Q|Bro016
me018|um in terms of gender.|S|Bro016
me018|the data?|Q|Bro016
me013|do you know?|Q|Bro016
mn007|huh.|F|Bro016
mn007|almost.|S|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro016
me018|huh.|B|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|huh.|B|Bro016
me013|okay.|F|Bro016
me013|you're you were saying before.|S|Bro016
mn007|uh yeah.|F|Bro016
mn007|so this noise|D|Bro016
mn007|um|F|Bro016
mn007|yeah the m s g|D|Bro016
mn007|um|F|Bro016
mn007|huh|F|Bro016
mn007|there is something perhaps i could spend some days to look at this thing.|S|Bro016
mn007|because it seems that when we train networks on let's say on timit with m s g features they they look as good as networks trained on p l p.|S|Bro016
mn007|but|F|Bro016
mn007|um|F|Bro016
mn007|when they are used on on the speechdat car data it's not the case.|S|Bro016
mn007|oh well.|S|Bro016
mn007|the m s g features are much worse.|S|Bro016
mn007|and so maybe they're um less more sensitive to different recording conditions.|S|Bro016
me013|shouldn't be.|S|Bro016
mn007|or|D|Bro016
me013|they should be less so.|S|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro016
mn007|but|D|Bro016
me013|right?|Q|Bro016
mn007|huh.|B|Bro016
me013|but let me ask you this.|S|Bro016
me013|what what's the um|D|Bro016
me013|do you recall if the insertions were were higher with m s g?|Q|Bro016
mn007|i don't know.|S|Bro016
mn007|i cannot tell.|S|Bro016
mn007|but|D|Bro016
mn007|it's it|D|Bro016
mn007|the the error rate is higher.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah but you should always look at insertions deletions and substitutions.|S|Bro016
mn007|so i|D|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|so uh|F|Bro016
me013|m s g is very very|D|Bro016
me013|uh p l p is very much like mel cepstrum.|S|Bro016
me013|m s g is very different from both of them.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|so if it's very different then this is the sort of thing|D|Bro016
me013|i mean i'm really glad andreas brought this point up.|S|Bro016
me013|i sort of had forgotten to discuss it.|S|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|you always have to look at how this uh these adjustments uh affect things.|S|Bro016
me013|and even though we're not allowed to do that again we maybe could reflect that back to our use of the features.|S|Bro016
me013|so if it if in fact uh|D|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|the problem might be that the range of the m s g features is quite different than the range of the p l p or mel cepstrum.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|and you might want to change that.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
mn007|but|F|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro016
mn007|but it's it's after|D|Bro016
mn007|well it's tandem features.|S|Bro016
mn007|so|F|Bro016
mn007|huh|F|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro016
mn007|we we have estimation of posteriors with p l p and with m s g as input.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
mn007|so i|D|Bro016
mn007|well.|F|Bro016
mn007|i don't know.|S|Bro016
me013|that means they're between zero and one.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro016
me013|but it it it it doesn't necessarily|D|Bro016
me013|you know they could be|D|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|doesn't tell you what the variance of the things is.|S|Bro016
mn007|huh.|B|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|right?|Q|Bro016
me013|because if you're taking the log of these things it could be|D|Bro016
me013|uh|F|Bro016
me013|knowing what the sum of the probabilities are doesn't tell you what the sum of the logs are.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro016
mn007|so we should look at the likelihood.|S|Bro016
mn007|or or|F|Bro016
mn007|what|D|Bro016
mn007|or|F|Bro016
mn007|well|F|Bro016
mn007|at the log perhaps.|S|Bro016
mn007|and|F|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
me013|or what you know what you're uh the thing you're actually looking at.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|so your your|D|Bro016
me013|the values that are are actually being fed into h t k.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|what do they look like?|Q|Bro016
mn007|but|F|Bro016
me018|and so the uh for the tandem system the values that come out of the net don't go through the sigmoid.|S|Bro016
me018|right?|Q|Bro016
me018|they're sort of the pre nonlinearity values?|Q|Bro016
me013|right.|S|Bro016
mn007|yes.|S|Bro016
me013|so they're kind of like log probabilities is what i was saying.|S|Bro016
me018|and those|D|Bro016
me018|okay.|S|Bro016
me018|and that's what goes into h t k?|Q|Bro016
me013|uh almost.|S|Bro016
me013|but then you actually do a k l t on them.|S|Bro016
me018|okay.|S|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|they aren't normalized after that.|S|Bro016
me013|are they?|Q|Bro016
mn007|huh no.|S|Bro016
mn007|they are not.|S|Bro016
me013|no.|S|Bro016
mn007|no.|S|Bro016
me013|okay.|S|Bro016
me013|so um|F|Bro016
me013|right.|F|Bro016
me013|so the question is yeah whatever they are at that point um are they something for which taking a square root or cube root or fourth root or something like that is is going to be a good or a bad thing.|S|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|uh and that's something that|D|Bro016
me013|nothing nothing else after that is going to|D|Bro016
me013|uh things are going to scale it.|S|Bro016
me013|uh you know subtract things from it.|S|Bro016
me013|scale it from it.|S|Bro016
me013|but nothing will have that same effect.|S|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|anyway uh|F|Bro016
me018|yeah.|F|Bro016
me018|because if if the log probs that are coming out of the m s g are really big the standard insertion penalty is going to have very little effect.|S|Bro016
me013|well the|F|Bro016
me013|right.|S|Bro016
me018|compared to you know a smaller set of log probs.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
me013|no again you don't really look at that.|S|Bro016
me013|it's something that|D|Bro016
me013|and then it's going through this transformation that's probably pretty close to|D|Bro016
me013|it's uh whatever the k l t is doing.|S|Bro016
me013|but it's probably pretty close to what a a a discrete cosine transformation is doing.|S|Bro016
me018|yeah.|B|Bro016
me013|but still it's it's not going to probably radically change the scale of things.|S|Bro016
me013|i would think.|S|Bro016
me013|and uh|F|Bro016
me013|yeah.|F|Bro016
me013|it may be entirely off.|S|Bro016
me013|and and it may be at the very least it may be quite different for m s g than it is for mel cepstrum or p l p.|S|Bro016
me013|so that would be|D|Bro016
me013|so the first thing i'd look at without adjusting anything would just be to go back to the experiment and look at the uh substitutions insertions and deletions.|S|Bro016
me013|and if the if|D|Bro016
me013|the uh|F|Bro016
me013|if there's a fairly large effect of the difference say uh uh the ratio between insertions and deletions for the two cases then that would be uh an indicator that it might might be in that direction.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|anything else?|Q|Bro016
mn007|yeah but|F|Bro016
mn007|my my point was more that it it works sometimes.|S|Bro016
mn007|and|D|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
mn007|but sometimes it doesn't work.|S|Bro016
mn007|so|F|Bro016
me013|well.|F|Bro016
mn007|and it works on t i digits.|S|Bro016
mn007|and on speechdat car it doesn't work.|S|Bro016
mn007|and|D|Bro016
me013|yeah.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|F|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro016
mn007|well.|F|Bro016
me013|but you know some problems are harder than others.|S|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|and|F|Bro016
me013|and uh sometimes you know there's enough evidence for something to work.|S|Bro016
me013|and then it's harder.|S|Bro016
me013|it breaks.|S|Bro016
me013|you know?|Q|Bro016
me013|so it's|D|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|but it but um it it could be that when you say it works maybe we could be doing much better.|S|Bro016
me013|even in t i digits.|S|Bro016
me013|right?|Q|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
mn007|yeah sure.|S|Bro016
mn007|uh|F|Bro016
me013|huh.|B|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro016
mn007|well.|F|Bro016
mn007|there is also the spectral subtraction.|S|Bro016
mn007|which|D|Bro016
mn007|um|F|Bro016
mn007|i think maybe we should uh try to integrate it in in our system.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|S|Bro016
mn007|huh.|B|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|right.|B|Bro016
mn007|but|F|Bro016
mn007|i think that would involve to to huh use a big a already a big bunch of the system of ericsson.|S|Bro016
mn007|because he has spectral subtraction.|S|Bro016
mn007|then it's followed by um other kind of processing that's are dependent on the uh if it's speech or or silence.|S|Bro016
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
mn007|and there is this kind of spectral flattening after if it's silence.|S|Bro016
mn007|and|F|Bro016
mn007|and i i think it's important um to reduce this musical noise and this this increase of variance during silence portions.|S|Bro016
mn007|so|F|Bro016
mn007|well.|F|Bro016
mn007|this was this would involve to take almost everything from from the this proposal.|S|Bro016
mn007|and|F|Bro016
mn007|and then just add some kind of on line normalization in in the neural network.|S|Bro016
mn007|huh.|B|Bro016
me013|okay.|S|Bro016
me013|well this'll be i think something for discussion with hynek next week.|S|Bro016
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro016
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
me013|okay.|B|Bro016
me013|right.|B|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me013|how are uh uh how are things going with what you're doing?|Q|Bro016
me026|oh.|S|Bro016
me026|well um|F|Bro016
me026|i took a lot of time just getting my taxes out of the way.|S|Bro016
me026|multi national taxes.|S|Bro016
me026|so i'm i'm starting to write code now for my work.|S|Bro016
me026|but i don't have any results yet.|S|Bro016
me026|um it would be good for me to talk to hynek i think when he's here.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|S|Bro016
me026|do you know what his schedule will be like?|Q|Bro016
me013|uh he'll be around for three days.|S|Bro016
me013|uh we'll have a lot of time.|S|Bro016
me026|okay.|S|Bro016
me026|so|D|Bro016
me013|so uh|F|Bro016
me026|okay.|S|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|i'll uh|F|Bro016
me013|you know he's|D|Bro016
me013|he'll|D|Bro016
me013|he'll be talking with everybody in this room.|S|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me018|but you said you won't you won't be here next thursday?|Q|Bro016
me013|not thursday and friday.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|because i will be at faculty retreat.|S|Bro016
me018|huh.|B|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me013|i'll try to connect with him and people as as i can on on wednesday.|S|Bro016
me013|but|F|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|oh how'd taxes go?|Q|Bro016
me013|taxes go okay?|Q|Bro016
me026|huh yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|F|Bro016
me013|that's just that's that's one of the big advantages of not making much money is the taxes are easier.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|F|Bro016
me018|unless you're getting money in two countries.|S|Bro016
me013|i think you are.|S|Bro016
me018|they both want their cut.|S|Bro016
me013|aren't you?|Q|Bro016
mn007|huh.|B|Bro016
me026|huh yeah.|S|Bro016
me018|right?|Q|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
me013|huh.|B|Bro016
me013|canada canada wants a cut?|Q|Bro016
me026|uhhuh.|S|Bro016
me013|have to do so you you have to do two returns?|Q|Bro016
me026|huh uh for two thousand i did.|S|Bro016
me026|yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|oh oh.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|for|D|Bro016
me013|that's right.|S|Bro016
me018|but not for this next year?|Q|Bro016
me013|two thousand.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|probably not this next year i guess.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|F|Bro016
me026|um|F|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
me026|uh i'll i'll still have a bit of canadian income.|S|Bro016
me026|but it'll be less complicated.|S|Bro016
me026|because i will not be a considered a resident of canada anymore.|S|Bro016
me026|so i won't have to declare my american income on my canadian return.|S|Bro016
me013|okay.|B|Bro016
me013|all right.|F|Bro016
me013|uh|F|Bro016
me013|barry?|Q|Bro016
me013|do you want to say something about your stuff here?|Q|Bro016
me006|oh.|S|Bro016
me006|um|F|Bro016
me006|right.|S|Bro016
me006|i just um continuing looking at uh uh phonetic events.|S|Bro016
me006|and uh this tuesday going to be uh meeting with john ohala with chuck to talk some more about these uh um phonetic events.|S|Bro016
me006|um came up with uh a plan of attack.|S|Bro016
me006|uh going to execute.|S|Bro016
me006|and|F|Bro016
me006|um|F|Bro016
me006|yeah.|S|Bro016
me006|it's that's pretty much it.|S|Bro016
me013|oh well.|F|Bro016
me013|um why don't you say something about what it is?|Q|Bro016
me006|oh.|S|Bro016
me006|you oh you want you want details.|S|Bro016
me006|huh|F|Bro016
me006|okay.|S|Bro016
me013|well we're all gathered here together.|S|Bro016
me013|i thought we'd you know|D|Bro016
me006|i was hoping i could wave my hands.|S|Bro016
me006|um|F|Bro016
me006|so|F|Bro016
me006|um|F|Bro016
me006|so once|D|Bro016
me006|i i was thinking getting getting us a set of acoustic events to um to be able to distinguish between uh phones and words and stuff.|S|Bro016
me006|and um|F|Bro016
me006|once we|D|Bro016
me006|we would figure out a set of these events that can be you know um hand labeled or or derived uh from the hand labeled phone targets.|S|Bro016
me006|um we could take these events and um do some cheating experiments.|S|Bro016
me006|um where we feed um these events into an s r i system um uh and evaluate its performance on a switchboard task.|S|Bro016
me026|hey barry?|Q|Bro016
me006|uh yeah.|S|Bro016
me026|can you give an example of an event?|Q|Bro016
me006|yeah.|S|Bro016
me006|sure.|S|Bro016
me006|um i i can give you an example of twenty odd events.|S|Bro016
me006|um|F|Bro016
me006|so in this paper um it's talking about phoneme recognition using acoustic events.|S|Bro016
me006|so things like frication or uh nasality.|S|Bro016
me013|whose paper is it?|Q|Bro016
me006|um|F|Bro016
me006|this is a paper by hubener and cardson benson berndsen.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
me013|huh.|B|Bro016
me013|from uh university of hamburg and bielefeld.|S|Bro016
me006|uhhuh.|S|Bro016
me013|okay.|S|Bro016
me006|um|F|Bro016
me018|yeah i think the|D|Bro016
me018|just to expand a little bit on the idea of acoustic event.|S|Bro016
me006|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me018|there's um in my mind anyways there's a difference between um acoustic features and acoustic events.|S|Bro016
me018|and i think of acoustic features as being um things that linguists talk about.|S|Bro016
me018|like um|D|Bro016
me013|so stuff that's not based on data.|S|Bro016
me018|stuff that's not based on data necessarily.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|S|Bro016
me013|oh okay.|S|Bro016
me018|right.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
me018|that's not based on you know acoustic data.|S|Bro016
me013|okay.|B|Bro016
me018|so they talk about features for phones.|S|Bro016
me018|like uh its height.|S|Bro016
me018|its tenseness.|S|Bro016
me006|yeah.|B|Bro016
me018|laxness.|S|Bro016
me018|things like that.|S|Bro016
me006|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me018|which may or may not be all that easy to measure in the acoustic signal.|S|Bro016
me018|versus an acoustic event which is just something in the acoustic signal that is fairly easy to measure.|S|Bro016
me018|um so it's um it's a little different.|S|Bro016
me018|in at least in my mind.|S|Bro016
me013|i mean when we did the spam work i mean there we had we had this notion of an uh auditory auditory event.|S|Bro016
me006|good that's great.|S|Bro016
me013|and uh|F|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|called them avents.|S|Bro016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|uh uh uh with an a at the front.|S|Bro016
me013|uh|F|Bro016
me013|and the the the idea was something that occurred that is important to a bunch of neurons somewhere.|S|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me006|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|um a sudden change or a relatively rapid change in some spectral characteristic will will do sort of this.|S|Bro016
me013|i mean there's certainly a bunch of a bunch of places where you know that neurons are going to fire because something novel has happened.|S|Bro016
me013|that was that was the main thing that we were focusing on there.|S|Bro016
me013|but there's certainly other things beyond what we talked about there that aren't just sort of rapid changes.|S|Bro016
me013|but|F|Bro016
me018|it's kind of like the difference between top down and bottom up.|S|Bro016
me013|yeah.|B|Bro016
me018|i think of the acoustic you know phonetic features as being top down.|S|Bro016
me018|you know you look at the phone.|S|Bro016
me018|and you say this phone is supposed to be you know have this feature this feature and this feature.|S|Bro016
me018|whether those features show up in the acoustic signal is sort of irrelevant.|S|Bro016
me018|whereas an acoustic event goes the other way.|S|Bro016
me018|here's the signal.|S|Bro016
me018|here's some event.|S|Bro016
me006|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me018|what|D|Bro016
me018|and then that you know that may map to this phone sometimes.|S|Bro016
me018|and sometimes it may not.|S|Bro016
me018|it just maybe depends on the context.|S|Bro016
me018|things like that.|S|Bro016
me018|and so it's sort of a different way of looking.|S|Bro016
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me006|yeah.|B|Bro016
me006|so|F|Bro016
me006|yeah.|F|Bro016
me026|okay.|S|Bro016
me006|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me006|um|F|Bro016
me006|using these these events um you know we can we can perform these these uh cheating experiments.|S|Bro016
me006|see how how how good they are um in um in terms of phoneme recognition or word recognition.|S|Bro016
me006|and|F|Bro016
me006|um|F|Bro016
me006|and then from that point on i would uh design robust event detectors um in a similar um spirit that saul has done uh with his graphical models and this this probabilistic and or model that he uses.|S|Bro016
me006|um|F|Bro016
me006|uh try to extend it to um to account for other other phenomena like um c m r co modulation release.|S|Bro016
me006|and|F|Bro016
me006|um|F|Bro016
me006|and maybe also investigate ways to to modify the structure of these models um in a data driven way.|S|Bro016
me006|uh similar to the way that uh jeff jeff uh bilmes did his work.|S|Bro016
me006|um|F|Bro016
me006|and while i'm i'm doing these um event detectors you know i can measure my progress by comparing um the error rates in clean and noisy conditions to something like uh neural nets.|S|Bro016
me006|um|F|Bro016
me006|and|F|Bro016
me006|so|F|Bro016
me006|so once we have these these uh event detectors um we could put them together and and feed the outputs of the event detectors into into the s r i um h m m h m m system.|S|Bro016
me006|and|F|Bro016
me006|um|F|Bro016
me006|and test it on on switchboard or um maybe even aurora stuff.|S|Bro016
me006|and|F|Bro016
me006|that's pretty much the the big picture of of um the plan.|S|Bro016
me013|by the way|F|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|there's uh a couple people who are going to be here.|S|Bro016
me013|i forget if i already told you this.|S|Bro016
me013|but a couple people who are going to be here for six months.|S|Bro016
me006|uhhuh.|B|Bro016
me013|uh|F|Bro016
me013|uh there's a professor kollmeier uh from germany.|S|Bro016
me013|who's uh uh quite big in the uh hearing aid signal processing area.|S|Bro016
me013|and um michael kleinschmidt who's worked with him.|S|Bro016
me013|who also looks at auditory properties inspired by various uh brain function things.|S|Bro016
me006|huh.|B|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me013|um|F|Bro016
me013|um i think they'll be interesting to talk to in this sort of issue.|S|Bro016
me013|as these detectors are are uh developing.|S|Bro016
me006|huh.|B|Bro016
me006|okay.|S|Bro016
me013|so he looks at interesting interesting things in in the different ways of looking at spectra in order to to get various speech properties out.|S|Bro016
me013|so|F|Bro016
me006|okay.|B|Bro016
me013|okay.|F|Bro016
me013|well|F|Bro016
me013|short meeting.|S|Bro016
me013|but that's okay.|S|Bro016
me013|and uh|F|Bro016
me013|we might as well do our digits.|S|Bro016
me013|and like i say i i encourage you to go ahead and meet uh next week with uh uh hynek.|S|Bro016
me013|all right.|S|Bro016
me013|i'll i'll start.|S|Bro016
me013|it's uh one thirty five.|S|Bro016
