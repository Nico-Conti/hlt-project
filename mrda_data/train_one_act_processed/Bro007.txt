me013|okay.|F|Bro007
me013|so|F|Bro007
me013|uh today we're looking at a number of uh things we're trying.|S|Bro007
me013|and uh fortunately for listeners to this uh we lost some of it's visual.|S|Bro007
me013|but um got tables in front of us.|S|Bro007
me013|um what is what does combo mean?|Q|Bro007
mn007|so combo is um a system where we have these features that go through a network.|S|Bro007
mn007|and then this same string of features but low pass filtered with the low pass filter used in the m s g features.|S|Bro007
mn007|and so these low pass filtered goes through m uh another m l p.|S|Bro007
mn007|and then the linear output of these two m l p's are combined just by adding the values and then there is this k l t.|S|Bro007
mn007|um the output is used as uh features as well.|S|Bro007
me013|um so let me try to restate this and see if i have it right.|S|Bro007
me013|there is uh there is the features uh there's the o g i features and then um those features um go through a contextual uh|D|Bro007
me013|l l let's take this bottom one pointed to by the bottom arrow.|S|Bro007
me013|um those features go through a contextualized k l t.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro007
me013|then these features also uh get um low pass filtered.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|so|F|Bro007
mn007|yeah i could perhaps draw this on the blackboard.|S|Bro007
me013|sure.|S|Bro007
me013|yeah.|S|Bro007
me013|yeah.|B|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
fn002|the graph.|S|Bro007
fn002|yeah another one.|S|Bro007
mn007|thank you.|S|Bro007
me013|yeah that's good.|S|Bro007
mn007|so we have these features from o g i that goes through the three paths.|S|Bro007
me013|yeah.|S|Bro007
me013|three okay.|S|Bro007
mn007|the first is a k l t using several frames of the features.|S|Bro007
me013|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|yeah.|B|Bro007
mn007|the second path is uh m l p also using nine frames several frames of features.|S|Bro007
me013|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
mn007|the third path is this low pass filter.|S|Bro007
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
mn007|uh m l p.|S|Bro007
me013|aha!|S|Bro007
me013|aha!|S|Bro007
mn007|adding the outputs just like in the second the the proposal from for the first evaluation.|S|Bro007
me013|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|yeah.|B|Bro007
mn007|and then the k l t and then the two together again.|S|Bro007
me013|no the k l t.|S|Bro007
me013|and those two together.|S|Bro007
fn002|two h t k.|S|Bro007
me013|that's it.|S|Bro007
mn007|um so this is|D|Bro007
me013|okay so that's that's this bottom one.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro007
me013|and so uh and then the the the one at the top.|S|Bro007
me013|and i presume these things that uh are in yellow are in yellow because overall they're the best?|Q|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|that's the reason yeah.|S|Bro007
me013|oh let's focus on them then.|S|Bro007
me013|so what's the block diagram for the one above it?|Q|Bro007
mn007|for the the first yellow line you mean?|Q|Bro007
me013|yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
mn007|so it's uh basically the same except that we don't have this uh low pass filtering so we have only two streams.|S|Bro007
fn002|step.|S|Bro007
mn007|well.|F|Bro007
mn007|there's there's no low low pass processing used as additional feature stream.|S|Bro007
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
mn007|um|F|Bro007
me013|do you um they mentioned made some uh when i was on the phone with sunil they they mentioned some weighting scheme that was used to evaluate all of these numbers.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|uh actually the way things seems to|D|Bro007
mn007|um well it's uh forty percent for t i digit sixty for all the speechdat cars.|S|Bro007
mn007|well all these languages.|S|Bro007
mn007|um the well match is forty medium thirty five and high mismatch twenty five.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro007
me013|um and we don't have the t i digits part yet?|Q|Bro007
mn007|uh no.|S|Bro007
me013|okay.|S|Bro007
mn007|but yeah.|F|Bro007
mn007|generally what you observe with t i digits is that the result are very close whatever the the system.|S|Bro007
me013|okay.|S|Bro007
me013|and so have you put all these numbers together into a single number representing that?|Q|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|i mean not|D|Bro007
mn007|uh not yet.|S|Bro007
mn007|no.|S|Bro007
me013|okay so that should be pretty easy to do and that would be good.|S|Bro007
mn007|huh yeah yeah.|S|Bro007
me013|then we could compare the two and say what was better.|S|Bro007
mn007|huh.|B|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|um and how does this compare to the numbers?|Q|Bro007
me013|oh so o g i two is just the top top row?|Q|Bro007
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|so yeah to|D|Bro007
mn007|actually o g i two is the the baseline with the o g i features.|S|Bro007
mn007|but this is not exactly the result that they have because they've they're still made some changes in the features.|S|Bro007
me013|okay.|B|Bro007
mn007|and well but uh actually our results are better than their results.|S|Bro007
mn007|um i don't know by how much because they did not send us the new results.|S|Bro007
me013|okay.|S|Bro007
me013|uh okay so the one one place where it looks like we're messing things up a bit is in the highly mismatched italian.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro007
mn007|there is something funny happening here because|D|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro007
me013|yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|but there are thirty six and then sometimes we are we are we are around forty two and|D|Bro007
me013|now up.|S|Bro007
me013|uh so one of the ideas that you had mentioned last time was having a a second um silence detection.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|so there are some results here.|S|Bro007
fn002|for the italian.|S|Bro007
mn007|uh so the third and the fifth line of the table|D|Bro007
fn002|for this one.|S|Bro007
me013|so filt is what that is?|Q|Bro007
mn007|filt yeah.|S|Bro007
fn002|yeah.|B|Bro007
mn007|um yeah so it seems for the the well match and mismatched condition.|S|Bro007
mn007|it's uh it brings something.|S|Bro007
mn007|uh but uh actually apparently there are there's no room left for any silence detector at the server side because of the delay.|S|Bro007
mn007|uh well|F|Bro007
me013|oh we can't do it.|S|Bro007
me013|oh okay.|S|Bro007
mn007|no.|S|Bro007
fn002|for that for that we|D|Bro007
me013|oh.|B|Bro007
mn007|uh|F|Bro007
me013|too bad.|S|Bro007
me013|good idea but can't do it.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|okay.|F|Bro007
mn007|except i don't know because they i think they are still working well.|S|Bro007
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
mn007|uh two days ago they were still working on this trying to reduce the delay of the silence detector.|S|Bro007
mn007|so but|F|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro007
mn007|if we had time perhaps we could try to find uh some kind of compromise between the delay that's on the handset and on the server side.|S|Bro007
mn007|perhaps try to reduce the delay on the handset.|S|Bro007
mn007|and|F|Bro007
mn007|but well huh for the moment they have this large delay on the the feature computation and so we don't|D|Bro007
me013|okay.|B|Bro007
me013|so|F|Bro007
me013|all right so for now at least that's not there.|S|Bro007
me013|you have some results with low pass filter cepstrum.|S|Bro007
me013|doesn't have a huge effect but it but it looks like it you know maybe could help in a couple places.|S|Bro007
mn007|i|D|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro007
me013|uh little bit.|S|Bro007
me013|um and um um|F|Bro007
me013|yeah.|F|Bro007
me013|and uh let's see.|F|Bro007
me013|what else did we have in there?|Q|Bro007
me013|uh i guess it makes a um at this point this is|D|Bro007
me013|i i guess i should probably look at these others a little bit.|S|Bro007
me013|uh and you you yellowed these out.|S|Bro007
me013|uh but uh uh|F|Bro007
me013|oh i see yeah that that one you can't use because of the delay.|S|Bro007
me013|those look pretty good.|S|Bro007
me013|um let's see that one.|S|Bro007
me013|well even the just the the second row doesn't look that bad right?|S|Bro007
me013|that's just uh|D|Bro007
mn007|yep.|B|Bro007
me013|yeah?|D|Bro007
me013|and and that looks like an interesting one too.|S|Bro007
fn002|huh yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|uh|F|Bro007
mn007|actually the yeah the second line is uh pretty much like the first line in yellow.|S|Bro007
mn007|except that we don't have this k l t on the first on the left part of the diagram.|S|Bro007
mn007|we just have the features as they are.|S|Bro007
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
mn007|um|F|Bro007
me013|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|yeah so when we do this weighted measure we should compare the two because it might even come out better.|S|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro007
me013|and it's it's it's a little slightly simpler.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|so so there's so i i would put that one also as a as a maybe.|S|Bro007
me013|uh and it|D|Bro007
me013|yeah and it's actually does does significantly better on the uh uh highly mismatched italian.|S|Bro007
me013|so|F|Bro007
me013|and little worse on the on the m m case.|S|Bro007
me013|but|F|Bro007
me013|uh well yeah it's worse than a few things.|S|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
me013|so uh let's see how that that see how that comes out on their their measure.|S|Bro007
me013|and are are we running this uh for t i digits?|Q|Bro007
me013|or uh|D|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro007
me013|now is t i di is that part of the result that they get for the uh development the results that they're supposed to get at the end of end of the month the t i digits are there also?|Q|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|it's included yeah.|S|Bro007
me013|oh okay.|S|Bro007
me013|okay.|B|Bro007
me013|and see what else there is here.|S|Bro007
me013|um oh i see.|S|Bro007
me013|the one i was looking down here at the the the row below the lower yellowed one.|S|Bro007
me013|uh that's uh that's with the reduced uh k l t size reduced dimensionality.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro007
me013|what happens there is it's around the same.|S|Bro007
me013|and so you could reduce the dimension as you were saying before a bit perhaps.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah it's it's significantly worse well but uhhuh.|S|Bro007
me013|it's significantly worse.|S|Bro007
me013|it's it's uh it's it's mostly worse.|S|Bro007
mn007|except for the h m.|S|Bro007
fn002|for many a mismatch it's worse.|S|Bro007
mn007|but|F|Bro007
me013|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|but it is little.|S|Bro007
me013|i mean not not by a huge amount.|S|Bro007
me013|i don't know.|S|Bro007
me013|what are what are the sizes of any of these sets?|Q|Bro007
me013|i i'm i'm sure you told me before but i've forgotten.|S|Bro007
me013|so you know how many words are in uh one of these test sets?|Q|Bro007
mn007|uh|F|Bro007
fn002|i don't remember.|S|Bro007
mn007|um it's it depends well the well matched is generally larger than the other sets.|S|Bro007
me013|about?|Q|Bro007
mn007|and i think it's around two thousand or three thousand words perhaps at least.|S|Bro007
fn002|but words well word i don't know.|S|Bro007
mn007|huh?|Q|Bro007
mn007|the words yeah.|S|Bro007
fn002|sentences.|S|Bro007
mn007|sentences.|S|Bro007
mn007|some sets have five hundred sentences.|S|Bro007
mn007|so|F|Bro007
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|huh.|B|Bro007
me013|so the so the sets so the test sets are between five hundred and two thousand sentences let's say.|S|Bro007
me013|and each sentence on the average has four or five digits?|Q|Bro007
me013|or is it most of them longer or|D|Bro007
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro007
fn002|for the italian even seven digits more or less.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|it it|D|Bro007
fn002|but sometime the sentence have only one digit.|S|Bro007
mn007|seven digits.|S|Bro007
fn002|and sometime uh like uh the number of uh credit cards something like that.|S|Bro007
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
me013|right so between one and sixteen.|S|Bro007
me013|see the i mean the reason i'm asking is is is we have all these small differences and i don't know how seriously to take them right?|S|Bro007
me013|so uh if if you had uh just you know to give an example if you had uh um if you had a thousand words then uh a a tenth of a percent would just be one word.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|right?|Q|Bro007
me013|so so it wouldn't mean anything.|S|Bro007
fn002|yeah.|B|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|oh.|B|Bro007
me013|um so um yeah it be kind of i'd kind of like to know what the sizes of these test sets were actually.|S|Bro007
fn002|the size that we have?|Q|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
mn007|we could we could run run some kind of significance tests.|S|Bro007
me013|yeah since these|D|Bro007
me013|well also just to know the numbers.|S|Bro007
mn007|or|F|Bro007
fn002|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|right.|B|Bro007
me013|so these these are word error rates.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|so this is on how many words?|Q|Bro007
mn007|yep.|B|Bro007
fn002|yeah we have the result that the output of the h t k.|S|Bro007
me013|yeah.|B|Bro007
fn002|the number of of sentences no it's the number isn't.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah sure sure.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah sure.|B|Bro007
me013|yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|so anyway if you could just mail out what those numbers are and then then that that be great.|S|Bro007
fn002|yeah.|S|Bro007
me013|um what else is there here?|Q|Bro007
me013|um see the second second from the bottom it says s i l.|S|Bro007
me013|but this is some different kind of silence or thing or|D|Bro007
me013|what was that?|Q|Bro007
mn007|uh|F|Bro007
fn002|it the the output silence of the m l p.|S|Bro007
mn007|oh yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|i see.|S|Bro007
fn002|it's only one small experiment to know what happened.|S|Bro007
fn002|to apply also to include also the the silence of the m l p we have the fifty six form and the silence to pick up the silence and we include those.|S|Bro007
me013|yes.|B|Bro007
me013|uhhuh uhhuh.|B|Bro007
me013|the silence plus the k l t output?|Q|Bro007
me013|oh so you're only using the silence.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
fn002|yeah because when we apply the k l t|D|Bro007
mn007|no they're i think there is this silence in addition to the um k l t outputs.|S|Bro007
me013|no.|S|Bro007
fn002|in addition yes.|S|Bro007
fn002|in addition|D|Bro007
mn007|it is because we we we just keep uh we don't keep all the dimensions after the k l t.|S|Bro007
mn007|and yeah.|F|Bro007
fn002|and we not we are not sure if we pick we have the silence.|S|Bro007
mn007|so we try to add the silence also in addition to the these twenty eight dimensions.|S|Bro007
me013|i see.|S|Bro007
me013|okay.|B|Bro007
me013|and what and what's o g i forty five?|Q|Bro007
mn007|uh it's it's o g i two.|S|Bro007
me013|the bottom one there?|Q|Bro007
mn007|it's so the it's the features from the first line.|S|Bro007
fn002|it's in fact o g i two.|S|Bro007
mn007|and yeah.|F|Bro007
me013|right but i mean what's the what does the last row mean?|S|Bro007
mn007|so it's uh basically this but without the k l t on the from the left path.|S|Bro007
me013|i thought that was the one i thought that was the second row.|S|Bro007
me013|so what's the difference between the second|D|Bro007
mn007|uh the second line you don't have this combo stuff so you just|D|Bro007
me013|oh.|S|Bro007
mn007|uh|F|Bro007
me013|so this is like the second line but with with the combo stuff.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
fn002|and with the all the output of the combo.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|okay.|B|Bro007
me013|yeah.|B|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
fn002|uh|F|Bro007
me013|okay so|F|Bro007
me013|all right.|F|Bro007
me013|so it looks to me i guess the same.|S|Bro007
me013|given that we have to take the filt ones out of the the running because of this delay problem so it looks to me like the ones you said i agree are are the ones to look at.|S|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
me013|but i just would add the the the second row one.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|and then um if we can um|F|Bro007
mn007|huh.|B|Bro007
me013|oh yeah also when when they're using this weighting scheme of forty thirty five twenty five is that on the percentages or on the raw errors?|Q|Bro007
me013|i guess it's probably on the percentages right?|S|Bro007
mn007|uh i guess yeah.|S|Bro007
me013|yeah okay.|S|Bro007
mn007|i guess yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|huh.|B|Bro007
me013|all right.|B|Bro007
mn007|it's not clear here.|S|Bro007
me013|okay.|S|Bro007
me013|maybe maybe they'll argue about it.|S|Bro007
me013|um okay.|F|Bro007
me013|so if we can know what how many words are in each.|S|Bro007
me013|and then um dave uh dave promised to get us something tomorrow which will be there as far as they've gotten friday.|S|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|and then we'll operate with that.|S|Bro007
me013|and uh how long did it|D|Bro007
me013|i guess if we're not doing all these things if we're only doing um|D|Bro007
me013|um i guess since this is development data it's legitimate to do more than one.|S|Bro007
me013|right?|Q|Bro007
me013|i mean ordinarily if in final test data you don't want to do several and and take the best.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
mn007|huh.|B|Bro007
me013|that's that's that's not proper.|S|Bro007
me013|but if this is development data we could still look at a couple.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|we can.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|sure.|S|Bro007
mn007|but we have to decide.|S|Bro007
mn007|i mean we have to fix the system on this on this data to choose the best.|S|Bro007
me013|yeah.|B|Bro007
mn007|and these|D|Bro007
me013|right.|S|Bro007
me013|but the question is when when do we fix the system.|S|Bro007
mn007|but we could.|S|Bro007
me013|do we fix the system uh tomorrow or do we fix the system on tuesday?|Q|Bro007
mn007|it|D|Bro007
mn007|i think we fixed on tuesday yeah.|S|Bro007
me013|i yeah okay except that we do have to write it up.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|also so|F|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|um|F|Bro007
mn007|uh yeah well.|F|Bro007
mn007|well basically it's this with perhaps some kind of printing and some some other.|S|Bro007
me013|right.|S|Bro007
me013|so maybe what we do is we we we uh as soon as we get the data from them we start the training and so forth.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah but|F|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
me013|but we start the write up right away because as you say there there's only minor differences between these.|S|Bro007
mn007|i think you we could we could start soon yeah.|S|Bro007
me013|yeah.|B|Bro007
mn007|write up something.|S|Bro007
me013|yeah and and i i would you know i would i'd kind of like to see it.|S|Bro007
mn007|um yeah.|F|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
me013|maybe i can i can edit it a bit.|S|Bro007
me013|uh sure.|F|Bro007
me013|the my what in this in this situation is my forte which is english.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|uh so|F|Bro007
mn007|huh.|B|Bro007
me013|uh yeah.|F|Bro007
me013|have have you seen do they have a format for how they want the system descriptions or anything?|Q|Bro007
mn007|uh not really.|S|Bro007
me013|okay.|B|Bro007
mn007|um there is the format of the table which is quite impressive.|S|Bro007
me013|uh i see.|S|Bro007
me013|yes for those who are listening to this and not looking at it uh it's not really that impressive it's just tiny.|S|Bro007
me013|it's all these little categories set a set b set c multi condition clean.|S|Bro007
me013|uh no mitigation.|S|Bro007
me013|wow.|S|Bro007
me013|do you know what no what no mitigation means here?|Q|Bro007
mn007|um it should be the the problem with the error channel error.|S|Bro007
me013|oh that's probably the|D|Bro007
mn007|or|F|Bro007
me013|this is probably channel error stuff.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|huh?|Q|Bro007
me013|oh this is right it says right above here channel channel error resilience.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|yeah.|S|Bro007
me013|so recognition performance is just the top part actually.|S|Bro007
me013|uh and they have yes split between seen data bases and non seen so basically between development and and evaluation.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|and so|F|Bro007
me013|right.|F|Bro007
me013|it's presumed there's all sorts of tuning that's gone on on the what they call seen databases.|S|Bro007
me013|and there won't be tuning for the uh unseen.|S|Bro007
me013|multi condition multi condition.|S|Bro007
me013|so they have looks like they have|D|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
me013|uh uh|F|Bro007
me013|so they splitting up between the t i digits and everything else i see.|S|Bro007
me013|so the everything else is the speechdat car that's the multilingual|D|Bro007
mn007|yeah so it's not divided between languages you mean or|D|Bro007
me013|well it is.|S|Bro007
mn007|it just|D|Bro007
me013|it is.|S|Bro007
me013|but there's also there's these tables over here for the for the t i digits and these tables over here for the car data.|S|Bro007
mn007|oh yeah.|S|Bro007
me013|which is which is i guess all the multilingual stuff.|S|Bro007
me013|and then uh there's they also split up between multi condition and clean only.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
mn007|for t i digits.|S|Bro007
me013|yes.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah actually yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|for the t i digits they want to train on clean and on noisy.|S|Bro007
me013|yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|and yeah.|F|Bro007
me013|so we're doing that also i guess.|S|Bro007
mn007|uh yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|but uh we actually|D|Bro007
mn007|do we have the features?|Q|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro007
mn007|for the clean t i digits but we did not test it yet.|S|Bro007
mn007|uh the clean training stuff.|S|Bro007
me013|okay.|S|Bro007
mn007|huh.|B|Bro007
me013|well anyway sounds like there'll be a lot to do just to work with our partners to fill out the tables over the next uh next few days.|S|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
fn002|yes.|B|Bro007
me013|i guess they have to send it out|D|Bro007
me013|let's see the thirty first is uh uh wednesday.|S|Bro007
me013|and i think the it has to be there by some hour uh european time on wednesday.|S|Bro007
mn007|huh huh.|B|Bro007
me013|so i think basically|D|Bro007
fn002|we lost time uh wednesday maybe because that the difference in the time may be is a long different of the time.|S|Bro007
me013|excuse me?|Q|Bro007
fn002|maybe the thursday the twelfth of the night of the thirty one is is not valid in europe.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
fn002|we don't know is happening.|S|Bro007
me013|yes so i mean i think we have to actually get it done tuesday.|S|Bro007
fn002|tuesday.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah well.|B|Bro007
me013|right.|F|Bro007
me013|because i i think|D|Bro007
mn007|except if if it's the thirty one at midnight.|S|Bro007
me013|uh uh|F|Bro007
mn007|or i don't know.|S|Bro007
mn007|we can still do some work on wednesday morning.|S|Bro007
me013|yeah well.|B|Bro007
mn007|yeah well.|F|Bro007
me013|is but is is it i thought it was actually something like five p m on|D|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro007
fn002|yeah.|B|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
me013|was like i thought it was five p m or something.|S|Bro007
me013|i didn't think it was midnight.|S|Bro007
me013|i thought they said they wanted everything by|D|Bro007
fn002|yeah five p m.|S|Bro007
me013|well so five p m their time is is|D|Bro007
fn002|not five p m three p m.|S|Bro007
me013|if|D|Bro007
me013|three p m.|S|Bro007
fn002|three p m.|S|Bro007
me013|all right that's six in the morning here.|S|Bro007
mn007|it's|D|Bro007
fn002|uh no.|S|Bro007
mn007|no.|S|Bro007
fn002|three three three p m?|Q|Bro007
mn007|no we are wondering about the the the hour that we have to|D|Bro007
mn007|uh i don't know if it's three p m it's|D|Bro007
fn002|oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.|S|Bro007
fn002|three p m here is in europe midnight.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah it's it's midnight but|D|Bro007
me013|yes yes but i didn't think it was midnight that it was due.|S|Bro007
fn002|oh okay.|S|Bro007
me013|i thought it was due at some hour during the day like five p m or something.|S|Bro007
fn002|huh huh.|B|Bro007
fn002|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
fn002|maybe.|D|Bro007
me013|in which case|D|Bro007
me013|so i i uh well we should look.|S|Bro007
me013|but my assumption is that we basically have to be done tuesday.|S|Bro007
me013|um so then next thursday we can sort of have a little aftermath.|S|Bro007
fn002|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|but then then we'll actually have the new data which is the german and the danish.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|but that really will be much less work because uh the system will be fixed.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|so all we'll do is take whatever they have and and uh and run it through the process.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
me013|uh we won't be changing the training on anything.|S|Bro007
me013|so there'll be no new training there'll just be new h t k runs.|S|Bro007
me013|so that's means in some sense we can kind of relax from this after after tuesday.|S|Bro007
me013|and and uh maybe next meeting we can start talking a little bit about where we want to go from here uh in terms of uh the research.|S|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
me013|um you know what things uh did you think of when you were uh doing this process that uh you just didn't really have time to adequately work on?|Q|Bro007
me013|uh uh so|F|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|what?|Q|Bro007
me006|oh stephane always has these great ideas.|S|Bro007
me006|and|D|Bro007
me006|oh but uh we don't have time.|S|Bro007
mn007|sure.|S|Bro007
me013|yeah.|B|Bro007
me006|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|yeah.|B|Bro007
mn007|i'm not sure these are great ideas.|S|Bro007
me013|but they're ideas.|S|Bro007
me013|yeah?|Q|Bro007
me013|oh that was good.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me006|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|and and uh also it's still true that uh i think it's true that that we we at least got fairly consistent improved results by running uh the uh neural net transformation in parallel with the features.|S|Bro007
mn007|but|D|Bro007
me013|rather than uh in sequence which was was your suggestion and that that that seems to have been borne out.|S|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
me013|the fact that none of these are are you know enormous is is is not too surprising .|S|Bro007
me013|most improvements aren't enormous.|S|Bro007
me013|and uh|F|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|some of them are.|S|Bro007
me013|but uh i mean you have something really really wrong and you fix it you can get big and really enormous improvements.|S|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
me013|but uh um because our best improvements over the years that we've gotten from finding bugs.|S|Bro007
me013|but|D|Bro007
me013|anyway.|F|Bro007
me013|okay.|F|Bro007
me013|well i i think i see where we are and everybody knows what they're doing and is there is there anything else we should talk about?|S|Bro007
me013|or or are we done?|Q|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
mn007|i think it's okay.|S|Bro007
mn007|um we|F|Bro007
mn007|so basically we will i think we'll try to to focus on these three architectures.|S|Bro007
mn007|and and perhaps i was thinking also a fourth one with just just a single k l t.|S|Bro007
mn007|because we did not really test that .|S|Bro007
mn007|removing all these k l t's and putting one single k l t at the end.|S|Bro007
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
me013|yeah i mean that would be pretty low maintenance to try it.|S|Bro007
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro007
me013|uh if you can fit it in.|S|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
me013|oh i have yeah i do have one other piece of information which uh i should tell people outside of this group too.|S|Bro007
me013|uh i don't know if we're going to need it uh but uh jeff up at the uh university of washington has uh gotten a hold of a uh uh some kind of server farm of uh of ten uh uh multiprocessor uh i b m machines r s six thousands.|S|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
me013|and and uh so i think each one is four processors or something or i don't know eight hundred megahertz or something.|S|Bro007
me013|and there's four processors in a box and there's ten boxes and there's some kind of|D|Bro007
me013|so if you know he's got a lot of processing power.|S|Bro007
me013|and um|F|Bro007
me013|we'd have to schedule it.|S|Bro007
me013|but if we have some big jobs and we want to want to want to run them he's he's offering it.|S|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
me013|so|F|Bro007
me013|it's uh|D|Bro007
me013|when he was here uh uh he he used not only every machine here but every machine on campus as far as i could tell.|S|Bro007
me013|so|F|Bro007
me013|so in some ways he just got his payback.|S|Bro007
me013|but uh again i i don't know if we'll end up with if we're going to be c p u limited on anything that we're doing in this group.|S|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
me013|but but if if we are that's an offer.|S|Bro007
me013|okay.|F|Bro007
me013|well uh you guys doing great stuff so that's that that's really neat.|S|Bro007
me013|and uh|F|Bro007
me013|we'll uh uh don't think we need to uh|D|Bro007
me013|um oh well the other thing i guess that i will say is that uh the digits that we're going to record momentarily is starting to get are starting to get into a pretty good size collection.|S|Bro007
me013|and um in addition to the speechdat stuff we will have those to work with really pretty soon now.|S|Bro007
me013|so that's that's another source of data.|S|Bro007
me013|um which is under somewhat better control and that we can we can make measurements of the room.|S|Bro007
me013|the uh that you know if we feel there's other measurements we don't have that we'd like to have we can make them.|S|Bro007
me013|and|F|Bro007
me013|uh dave and i were just talking about that a little while ago.|S|Bro007
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro007
me013|so uh that's another another possibility for this this kind of work.|S|Bro007
me013|k uh if nobody has anything else maybe we should go around do do our digits do our digits duty.|S|Bro007
me013|okay.|F|Bro007
me013|okay i'll start.|S|Bro007
