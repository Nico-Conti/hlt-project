me010|okay so here we are.|S|Bed017
me003|once again.|S|Bed017
me010|once again.|S|Bed017
me010|right.|S|Bed017
me010|together.|S|Bed017
me010|um so we haven't had a meeting for a while.|S|Bed017
me010|and and probably won't have one next week.|S|Bed017
me010|i think a number of people are gone.|S|Bed017
me010|um so robert why don't you bring us up to date on where we are with e d u?|Q|Bed017
mn015|um|F|Bed017
mn015|uh in a in a smaller group we had uh talked and decided about continuation of the data collection.|S|Bed017
mn015|so fey's time with us is almost officially over.|S|Bed017
mn015|and she brought us some thirty subjects and collected the data.|S|Bed017
mn015|and ten dialogues have been transcribed.|S|Bed017
mn015|and can be looked at.|S|Bed017
mn015|if you're interested in that talk to me.|S|Bed017
mn015|um and we found another uh cogsci student who's interested in playing wizard for us.|S|Bed017
mn015|here we're going to make it a little bit more complicated for the subjects uh this round.|S|Bed017
mn015|she's actually suggested to look um at the psychology department students.|S|Bed017
mn015|because they have to partake in two experiments in order to fulfill some requirements.|S|Bed017
mn015|so they have to be subjected before they can actually graduate.|S|Bed017
mn015|and um|F|Bed017
mn015|we want to design it so that they really have to think about having some time.|S|Bed017
mn015|two days for example.|S|Bed017
mn015|to plan certain things and figure out which can be done at what time.|S|Bed017
mn015|and|F|Bed017
mn015|um sort of package the whole thing in a in a in a few more complicated um structure.|S|Bed017
mn015|that's for the data collection.|S|Bed017
mn015|as for smartkom i'm the last smartkom meeting i mentioned that we have some problems with the synthesis.|S|Bed017
mn015|which as of this morning should be resolved.|S|Bed017
me010|good.|S|Bed017
mn015|and so|F|Bed017
mn015|should be means they aren't yet.|S|Bed017
mn015|but but i think i have the info now that i need.|S|Bed017
mn015|plus johno and i are meeting tomorrow.|S|Bed017
mn015|so maybe uh uh when tomorrow is over we're done.|S|Bed017
mn015|and we'll never have to look at it again.|S|Bed017
mn015|maybe it'll take some more time.|S|Bed017
mn015|to be realistic.|S|Bed017
mn015|but at least we're we're seeing the end of the tunnel there.|S|Bed017
mn015|that was that.|S|Bed017
mn015|um|F|Bed017
mn015|the uh|D|Bed017
mn015|uh i don't think we need to discuss the formalism.|S|Bed017
mn015|that'll be done officially once we're done.|S|Bed017
mn015|um|F|Bed017
mn015|something happened in on eva's side with the p r m that we're going to look at today.|S|Bed017
mn015|and um|F|Bed017
mn015|we have a visitor from bruchsal from the international university.|S|Bed017
mn015|andreas i think you've met everyone except nancy.|S|Bed017
fe004|sorry.|F|Bed017
mn059|yeah.|S|Bed017
fe004|hi hi.|S|Bed017
mn015|hi hi.|S|Bed017
mn015|and um|F|Bed017
fe004|so when you said andreas i thought you were talking about stolcke.|S|Bed017
fe004|now i know that we aren't.|S|Bed017
fe004|okay.|S|Bed017
mn015|andy you actually go by andy.|S|Bed017
mn015|right?|Q|Bed017
mn059|yeah.|S|Bed017
mn015|oh okay.|S|Bed017
mn059|because there is another andreas around.|S|Bed017
mn015|uh|D|Bed017
fe004|huh.|B|Bed017
mn059|so to avoid some confusion.|S|Bed017
mn015|that will be reuter?|Q|Bed017
mn059|yeah.|S|Bed017
mn015|oh okay.|S|Bed017
mn015|so my scientific director of the e m l is also the dean of the international university.|S|Bed017
mn015|one of his many occupations that just contributes to the fact that he is very occupied.|S|Bed017
mn015|and um|F|Bed017
mn015|the|D|Bed017
mn015|um he might tell us a little bit about what he's actually doing.|S|Bed017
mn015|and why it is somewhat related.|S|Bed017
mn015|and by uh using maybe some of the same technologies that we are using.|S|Bed017
mn015|and um was that enough of an update?|Q|Bed017
me010|i think so.|S|Bed017
mn015|in what order shall we proceed?|Q|Bed017
fn050|okay.|S|Bed017
mn015|maybe you have your online|D|Bed017
fn050|uh|F|Bed017
fn050|yeah sure.|S|Bed017
fn050|um so i've just been looking at um|D|Bed017
fn050|ack!|S|Bed017
fn050|what are you doing?|Q|Bed017
fn050|yeah.|B|Bed017
fn050|okay.|F|Bed017
fn050|um|F|Bed017
fn050|i've been looking at the p r m stuff.|S|Bed017
fn050|um|F|Bed017
fn050|so this is sort of like the latest thing i have on it.|S|Bed017
fn050|and|F|Bed017
fn050|i sort of constructed a couple of classes.|S|Bed017
fn050|like a user class a site class and and you know a time a route and then and a query class.|S|Bed017
fn050|and i tried to simplify it down a little bit.|S|Bed017
fn050|so that i can actually um look at it more.|S|Bed017
fn050|it's the same paper that i gave to jerry last time.|S|Bed017
fn050|um|F|Bed017
fn050|so basically i took out a lot of stuff a lot of the decision nodes.|S|Bed017
fn050|and then tried to|D|Bed017
fn050|the red lines on the um graph are the um relations between the different um classes.|S|Bed017
fn050|like a user has like a query.|S|Bed017
fn050|and then also has you know um reference slots to its preferences.|S|Bed017
fn050|um the special needs and you know money and the user interest.|S|Bed017
fn050|and so|F|Bed017
fn050|this is more or less similar to the flat bayes net that i have you know with the input nodes and all that.|S|Bed017
fn050|and|F|Bed017
fn050|so i tried to construct the dependency models.|S|Bed017
fn050|and|F|Bed017
fn050|a lot of these stuff i got from the flat bayes net.|S|Bed017
fn050|and what they depend on.|S|Bed017
fn050|and it turns out you know the c p t's are really big if i do that.|S|Bed017
fn050|so i tried to see how i can do um put in the computational nodes in between.|S|Bed017
fn050|and what that would look like in a p r m.|S|Bed017
fn050|and so i ended up making several classes.|S|Bed017
fn050|actually you know a class of with different attributes that are the intermediate nodes.|S|Bed017
fn050|and one of them is like time affordability money affordability site availability and the travel compatibility.|S|Bed017
fn050|and so some of these classes are|D|Bed017
fn050|some of these attributes only depend on stuff from say the user.|S|Bed017
fn050|or just from i don't know like the site.|S|Bed017
fn050|like um these here.|S|Bed017
fn050|it's only like user.|S|Bed017
fn050|but if you look at travel compatibility for each of these factors you need to look at a pair of you know what the um preference of the user is.|S|Bed017
fn050|versus you know what type of an event it is.|S|Bed017
fn050|or you know which form of transportation the user has.|S|Bed017
fn050|and whether you know the onsite parking matters to the user in that case.|S|Bed017
fn050|and that makes the scenario a little different in a p r m.|S|Bed017
fn050|because um then you have one user objects.|S|Bed017
fn050|and potentially you can have many different sites in in mind.|S|Bed017
fn050|and so|F|Bed017
fn050|for each of the site you'll come up with this rating of travel compatibility.|S|Bed017
fn050|and they all depend on the same users but different sites.|S|Bed017
fn050|and that makes a|D|Bed017
fn050|i'm i i have been trying to see whether the p r m would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that.|S|Bed017
fn050|and so|F|Bed017
fn050|i guess you end up having fewer number of nodes than in a flat bayes net.|S|Bed017
fn050|because otherwise you would|D|Bed017
fn050|well it's probably the same.|S|Bed017
fn050|but um|F|Bed017
fn050|no you would definitely have|D|Bed017
fn050|be able to re use like um all the user stuff.|S|Bed017
fn050|and not not having to recompute a lot of the stuff.|S|Bed017
fn050|because it's all from the user side.|S|Bed017
fn050|so if you changed sites you you can you know save some work on that.|S|Bed017
fn050|but|F|Bed017
fn050|you know in the case where it depends on both the user and the site then i'm still having a hard time trying to see how um using the p r m will help.|S|Bed017
fn050|um so anyhow using those intermediate nodes then this this would be the class that represent the intermediate nodes.|S|Bed017
fn050|and that would basically it's just another class in the model.|S|Bed017
fn050|with you know references to the user and the site and the time.|S|Bed017
fn050|and then after you group them together this|D|Bed017
fn050|the dependencies would of the queries would be reduced to this.|S|Bed017
fn050|and so you know it's easier to specify the c p t and all.|S|Bed017
fn050|um so i think that's about as far as i've gone on the p r m stuff.|S|Bed017
me010|well|D|Bed017
fn050|right?|Q|Bed017
me010|no.|S|Bed017
me010|so you didn't yet tell us what the output is.|S|Bed017
fn050|the output.|S|Bed017
me010|so what decisions does this make?|Q|Bed017
fn050|okay so it only makes two decisions in this model.|S|Bed017
fn050|and one is basically how desirable a site is.|S|Bed017
fn050|meaning um how good it matches the needs of a user.|S|Bed017
fn050|and the other is the mode of the visit.|S|Bed017
fn050|whether it's the e v a decision.|S|Bed017
fn050|um|F|Bed017
fn050|so instead of um doing a lot of you know computation about you know which one site it wants of the user wants to visit i'll come well try to come up with like sort of a list of sites.|S|Bed017
fn050|and for each site you know where how how well it fits.|S|Bed017
fn050|and basically a rating of how well it fits and what to do with it.|S|Bed017
fn050|so|F|Bed017
fn050|anything else i missed?|Q|Bed017
me010|so that was pretty quick.|S|Bed017
me010|she's uh uh eva's got a little write up on it.|S|Bed017
me010|that uh probably gives the the details to anybody who needs them.|S|Bed017
me010|um|F|Bed017
me010|so|F|Bed017
me010|the you you didn't look at all yet to see if there's anybody has a implementation?|Q|Bed017
fn050|no not yet.|S|Bed017
fn050|um|F|Bed017
me010|okay.|S|Bed017
me010|so one so one of the questions you know about these p r m's is|D|Bed017
fn050|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
me010|uh we aren't going to build our own interpreter.|S|Bed017
me010|so if if we can't find one then we uh go off and do something else and wait until one appears.|S|Bed017
me010|uh so one of the things that eva's going to do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down.|S|Bed017
me010|uh|F|Bed017
me010|the people at stanford write papers as if they had one.|S|Bed017
me010|but um we'll see.|S|Bed017
me010|so anyway so that's a a major open issue.|S|Bed017
me010|if there is an interpreter it looks like you know what eva's got should run.|S|Bed017
me010|and we should be able to actually um try to solve you know the problems.|S|Bed017
me010|to actually take the data and do it.|S|Bed017
me010|uh and we'll see.|S|Bed017
me010|uh i actually think it is cleaner.|S|Bed017
me010|and the ability to instantiate you know instance of people and sites and stuff um will help in the expression.|S|Bed017
me010|whether the inference gets any faster or not i don't know.|S|Bed017
me010|uh it wouldn't surprise me if it if it doesn't.|S|Bed017
fn050|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
me010|you know it's the same kind of information.|S|Bed017
me010|i think there are things that you can express this way which you can't express in a normal belief net.|S|Bed017
me010|uh without going to some incredible hacking.|S|Bed017
me010|of sort of rebuilding it on the fly.|S|Bed017
me010|i mean the notion of instantiating your elements from the ontology and stuff fits this very nicely and doesn't fit very well into the extended belief net.|S|Bed017
me010|so that was one of the main reasons for doing it.|S|Bed017
me010|um|F|Bed017
me010|i don't know.|S|Bed017
me010|so uh people who have thought about the problem like robert|D|Bed017
me010|it looked to me like if eva were able to come up with a you know value for each of a number of uh sites plus its e v a thing.|S|Bed017
me010|that a travel planner should be able to take it from there.|S|Bed017
me010|and you know with some other information about how much time the person has and whatever.|S|Bed017
me010|and then plan a route.|S|Bed017
mn015|uhhuh um well first of all uh uh great looks much cleaner.|S|Bed017
mn015|nnn nnn|D|Bed017
mn015|certain certain beauty in it.|S|Bed017
mn015|so um if beauty is truth then uh we're in good shape.|S|Bed017
mn015|but|F|Bed017
mn015|the um|D|Bed017
mn015|as uh mentioned before we probably should look at the details.|S|Bed017
mn015|so if you have a write up then uh i'd love to read it.|S|Bed017
fn050|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
mn015|and uh|F|Bed017
mn015|because um|D|Bed017
mn015|can you go all the way back to the the very top?|Q|Bed017
fn050|yeah.|S|Bed017
mn015|um uh these these when these are instantiated they take on the same values that we had before?|Q|Bed017
fn050|i can't really see the whole thing.|S|Bed017
mn015|or are they have they changed in a sense?|Q|Bed017
fn050|well i think i basically leave them to similar things.|S|Bed017
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
fn050|some of the things might that might be different maybe like are that the hours for the site.|S|Bed017
mn015|huh|B|Bed017
fn050|and eventually i meant that to mean whether they're open at this hour or not.|S|Bed017
fn050|and status would be you know more or less like whether they're under construction.|S|Bed017
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
fn050|and and or stuff like that.|S|Bed017
mn015|and the uh other question i would have is that presumably from the way the stanford people talk about it you can put the probabilities also on the relations.|S|Bed017
mn015|if|D|Bed017
fn050|which is the structural uncertainty?|Q|Bed017
me010|yeah.|S|Bed017
me010|yeah i that's|D|Bed017
me010|that i think was actually in the previous the ubenth stuff.|S|Bed017
me010|i don't remember whether they carried that over to this or not.|S|Bed017
fe004|huh|B|Bed017
me010|uh structural uncertainty.|S|Bed017
mn015|it's sort of in the definition or in the in daphne's definition of a p r m.|S|Bed017
mn015|is that classes and relations.|S|Bed017
me010|okay.|S|Bed017
mn015|and you're going to have c p t's over the classes and their relations.|S|Bed017
me010|all right.|F|Bed017
mn015|more uncertainty or or|D|Bed017
me010|uh|F|Bed017
fn050|i remember them learning when you know you don't know the structure for sure.|S|Bed017
mn015|i should say|D|Bed017
me010|yeah.|B|Bed017
fn050|but i don't remember reading how you specify.|S|Bed017
me010|right.|B|Bed017
mn015|yeah that would be exactly my question.|S|Bed017
fn050|to start with.|S|Bed017
fn050|yeah.|B|Bed017
mn015|well|F|Bed017
me010|yeah.|B|Bed017
fn050|yeah.|B|Bed017
me010|so uh the the plan is is when daphne gets back we'll get in touch.|S|Bed017
me010|and supposedly um we'll actually get deep seriously connected to to their work.|S|Bed017
me010|and|F|Bed017
mn015|yep.|S|Bed017
me010|somebody will uh you know if it's a group meeting once a week probably someone will go down and whatever.|S|Bed017
me010|so we'll actually figure all this out.|S|Bed017
mn015|okay.|S|Bed017
mn015|okay.|S|Bed017
mn015|then i think the long term perspective is is pretty clear.|S|Bed017
mn015|we get rocking and rolling on this again once we get a package.|S|Bed017
mn015|if when and how.|S|Bed017
mn015|then this becomes foregrounded.|S|Bed017
fn050|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
mn015|profiled.|S|Bed017
mn015|focused again.|S|Bed017
me003|designated?|Q|Bed017
fe004|of course.|S|Bed017
mn015|and um|F|Bed017
mn015|until then we'll come up with a something that's that's way more complicated for you.|S|Bed017
mn015|right?|Q|Bed017
fn050|okay.|S|Bed017
mn015|because this was laughingly easy.|S|Bed017
mn015|right?|Q|Bed017
fn050|actually i had to take out a lot of the complicated stuff.|S|Bed017
fn050|because i i made it really complicated in the beginning.|S|Bed017
fn050|and jerry was like this is just too much.|S|Bed017
me010|yeah so um|F|Bed017
me010|you could from this go on and say suppose there's a group of people traveling together.|S|Bed017
me010|and you wanted to plan something that somehow with some pareto optimal uh uh thing for|D|Bed017
fe004|that's good.|S|Bed017
fe004|that's definitely a job for artificial intelligence.|S|Bed017
me010|uh or|D|Bed017
mn015|well that's not not even something humans|D|Bed017
fe004|except for humans can't really solve it either so.|S|Bed017
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed017
me010|right.|S|Bed017
me010|right.|B|Bed017
me010|well that's the that would that would be a uh you could sell it as a|D|Bed017
fe004|yeah.|B|Bed017
me010|okay uh you don't have to fight about this just give your preferences to the|S|Bed017
fe004|and then you can blame the computer.|S|Bed017
me010|exactly.|S|Bed017
mn015|huh|B|Bed017
fe004|so|F|Bed017
mn015|but what does it uh would a potential result be to to split up and never talk to each other again?|Q|Bed017
mn015|you know.|B|Bed017
fe004|that should be one of them.|S|Bed017
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed017
me010|yeah right.|S|Bed017
me003|that'd be nice.|S|Bed017
fe004|huh|B|Bed017
me010|anyway.|F|Bed017
me010|so so there there are some some uh you know uh elaborations of this.|S|Bed017
me010|that you could try to put in to this structure.|S|Bed017
me010|but i don't think it's worth it now.|S|Bed017
me010|because we're going to see what what else uh what else we're going to do.|S|Bed017
me010|anyway.|S|Bed017
me010|but uh|F|Bed017
me010|it's good yeah.|S|Bed017
me010|and and there were a couple other ideas of of uh things for eva to look at.|S|Bed017
me010|in in the interim.|S|Bed017
mn015|good then we can move on and see what andreas has got out his sleeve.|S|Bed017
mn015|or andy for that matter.|S|Bed017
mn059|okay so uh uh well thanks for having me here first of all.|S|Bed017
mn059|um so maybe just a a little background on on my visit.|S|Bed017
mn059|so uh i'm not really involved in any project that's uh that's relevant to you uh at the moment.|S|Bed017
mn059|uh the the reason is really for me uh to have an opportunity to talk to some other researchers in the field.|S|Bed017
mn059|and and so i'll just sort of give you a real quick introduction to what i'm working on.|S|Bed017
mn059|and um i just hope that you have some comments.|S|Bed017
mn059|or maybe you're interested in it to find out more.|S|Bed017
mn059|and and so i'll be uh happy to talk to you.|S|Bed017
mn059|and and uh i'd also like to find out some more.|S|Bed017
mn059|and and maybe i'll just walk around the office.|S|Bed017
mn059|and|F|Bed017
mn059|and then and ask some some questions uh in a couple days.|S|Bed017
mn059|so i'll be here for uh tomorrow and then uh the remainder of uh next week.|S|Bed017
mn059|okay so um what i started looking at uh to begin with is just uh content management systems uh in general.|S|Bed017
mn059|so|F|Bed017
mn059|um uh what's uh sort of the state of the art there is to um uh you have a bunch of of uh documents or learning units or learning objects.|S|Bed017
mn059|um and you store meta data uh associate to them.|S|Bed017
mn059|so there's some international standards.|S|Bed017
mn059|like the i triple e uh there's an i triple e l o n standard.|S|Bed017
mn059|and um these fields are pretty straightforward you have uh author information you have uh size information format information and so on.|S|Bed017
mn059|uh but they're two uh fields that are um more interesting.|S|Bed017
mn059|one is uh you store keywords associated with the uh with the document.|S|Bed017
mn059|and one is uh you have sort of a um|D|Bed017
mn059|well what is the document about so it's some sort of taxonomic uh ordering of of the of the units.|S|Bed017
mn059|now if you sort of put on your semantic glasses uh you say well that's not all that easy.|S|Bed017
mn059|because there's an implicit um uh assumption behind that.|S|Bed017
mn059|is that uh all the users of this system share the same interpretation of the keyword and the same interpretation of uh whichever taxonomy is used.|S|Bed017
mn059|and uh|F|Bed017
mn059|i think that's a that's a very that's a key point of these systems.|S|Bed017
mn059|and they sort of always brush over this real quickly without really elaborating much of that.|S|Bed017
mn059|and uh as a matter of fact the only thing that apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes.|S|Bed017
mn059|which are very very coarse grain.|S|Bed017
mn059|so you have some like science biology and then|D|Bed017
mn059|but that's really all that we have at the moment.|S|Bed017
mn059|so i think there's a huge um uh need for improvement there.|S|Bed017
mn059|now what this uh a standard like this would give us is we could um sort of uh with a search engine just query uh different repositories all over the world.|S|Bed017
mn059|but we can't really|D|Bed017
mn059|um so what i'm what i try to do is um to have um|D|Bed017
mn059|uh so so the scenario is the following you're working on some sort of project and you encounter a certain problem.|S|Bed017
mn059|now what what we have at our university quite a bit is that uh students um try to program a certain assignment for example.|S|Bed017
mn059|they always run into the same problems.|S|Bed017
mn059|uh and they always come running to us.|S|Bed017
mn059|and they'll say why's it not it's not working.|S|Bed017
mn059|and we always give out the same answer.|S|Bed017
mn059|so we thought well it'd be nice to have a system that could sort of take care of this.|S|Bed017
mn059|and so what i want to build is basically a a smart f a q system.|S|Bed017
mn059|now what you uh need to do here is you need to provide some context information.|S|Bed017
mn059|which is more elaborate than i'm looking for this and this and this keyword.|S|Bed017
mn059|so|F|Bed017
mn059|and i think that i don't need to tell you this.|S|Bed017
mn059|i'm i'm sure you have the same when when somebody utters a sentence in a certain uh context.|S|Bed017
mn059|it and and the same sentence in another context makes a huge difference.|S|Bed017
mn059|so i want to be able to model information like um so in the in the context of in the context of developing distributed systems of at a computer science school.|S|Bed017
mn059|um what kind of software is the person using.|S|Bed017
mn059|which homework assignment is he or she working on at the moment.|S|Bed017
mn059|um maybe what's the background of that student's.|S|Bed017
mn059|um which um which error message was encountered.|S|Bed017
mn059|so this sort of information i think should be transmitted uh when a certain document is retrieved.|S|Bed017
mn059|now|F|Bed017
mn059|um|F|Bed017
mn059|basically giving this um uh|D|Bed017
mn059|so we somehow need to have a formalized um way of writing this down basically.|S|Bed017
mn059|and that's where the shared interpretation of of certain terms and keywords comes in again.|S|Bed017
mn059|and using this and some some uh knowledge about the domain i think you can do some some simple inferences.|S|Bed017
mn059|like you know that when somebody's working about uh working on on servlets for example.|S|Bed017
mn059|he's using java because servlets are used are written in java.|S|Bed017
mn059|so some some inferences like that.|S|Bed017
mn059|now um using this you can infer more information.|S|Bed017
mn059|and you could then match this to the meta data of um off the documents you're you're searching against.|S|Bed017
mn059|so uh what i want to do is basically have some sort of um given these inputs.|S|Bed017
mn059|and then i can compute how many documents match.|S|Bed017
mn059|and use this as a metric in the search.|S|Bed017
mn059|now what i plan to do is i want to uh sort of do a uh uh try to improve the quality of the search results.|S|Bed017
mn059|and i want to do this by having a depth uh um um steepest descent approach.|S|Bed017
mn059|so if i knew which operating system the person was working on would this improve my search result.|S|Bed017
mn059|and and having uh uh a symbolic formalized model of this i could simply compute that.|S|Bed017
mn059|and find out which um which questions are worth um asking.|S|Bed017
mn059|and that's what i then propagate back to the user.|S|Bed017
mn059|and and sort of try to optimize the search in this way.|S|Bed017
mn059|now the big problem that i'm facing right now is um it's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly that that works in the small domain.|S|Bed017
mn059|but the problem is obviously the scalability.|S|Bed017
mn059|and uh uh so robert was mentioning uh earlier today is that uh microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a bayesian network.|S|Bed017
mn059|which does exactly this.|S|Bed017
mn059|but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend.|S|Bed017
mn059|and so uh what i'm what i try to do is basically try to model this uh in a way that you could really combine uh knowledge from very different sources.|S|Bed017
mn059|and and um sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community uh came up with.|S|Bed017
mn059|trying to to have uh an approach how to integrate uh certain uh representation of certain concepts and also some computational rules.|S|Bed017
mn059|um what you can do with those.|S|Bed017
mn059|um|F|Bed017
mn059|what i'm also looking into is a probabilistic approach into this.|S|Bed017
mn059|because document retrievals is a very fuzzy procedure.|S|Bed017
mn059|so it's probably not that easy to simply have a symbolic uh computational model.|S|Bed017
mn059|that that probably isn't expressive enough.|S|Bed017
mn059|so so that's another thing.|S|Bed017
mn059|um which i think you're also uh uh looking into right now.|S|Bed017
mn059|and then um uh sort of as an add on to this whole idea um uh that would be|D|Bed017
mn059|now depending on what the search engine or the content repository depending on which um uh which uh rules and which ontologies it it uses or basically its view of the world uh you can get very different results.|S|Bed017
mn059|so it might make a lot of sense to actually query a lot of different search engines.|S|Bed017
mn059|and there you could have an idea where you actually have sort of a a peer to peer approach.|S|Bed017
mn059|where we're all sort of carrying around our individual bookshelves.|S|Bed017
mn059|and um if you have a question about a homework it's probably makes sense to ask somebody who's in your class with you sort of the guru in the certain area.|S|Bed017
mn059|rather than going to some yahoo like uh search engine.|S|Bed017
mn059|so these are some of the just in a nutshell some of the ideas.|S|Bed017
mn059|and i think a lot of the even though it's a it's a very different domain but i think a lot of the um issues are are fairly similar.|S|Bed017
mn059|so|F|Bed017
mn059|okay.|S|Bed017
fe004|and so some of the i don't know how much you know about the larger heidelberg project.|S|Bed017
fe004|i are you|D|Bed017
mn059|uh i know yeah i know about it.|S|Bed017
fe004|so it seems like a lot of some of the issues are the same.|S|Bed017
fe004|it's like um you know the context based factors that influence how you interpret|D|Bed017
mn059|uhhuh uhhuh.|B|Bed017
fe004|um how to interpret|D|Bed017
fe004|in in this case in knowing wanting to know what kinds of things to ask.|S|Bed017
fe004|we've kind of talked about that.|S|Bed017
fe004|but we haven't worried too much about that end of the discourse.|S|Bed017
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
fe004|but maybe you guys had that in the previous models.|S|Bed017
mn015|well in a in one one huh small difference in a in a way is that he doesn't have to come up with an answer.|S|Bed017
mn015|but he wants to point to the places|D|Bed017
mn059|yeah so so i'm i'm not i'm not building an expert.|S|Bed017
fe004|documents that have the answers.|S|Bed017
mn059|uh i want to build a smart librarian basically.|S|Bed017
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
fe004|right.|S|Bed017
mn059|that can point you to the right reference.|S|Bed017
fe004|right.|S|Bed017
mn059|i don't want to compute the answer.|S|Bed017
mn059|so it's a little bit easier for me.|S|Bed017
mn015|well uh you have to still understand what the content says about itself and then match it to what you think the informational needs.|S|Bed017
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
mn059|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
fe004|so you also don't have to figure out what the content is.|S|Bed017
fe004|you're just taking the keywords as a topic text.|S|Bed017
mn059|i i assume that that there will be learning systems that that tag their their content.|S|Bed017
fe004|as|D|Bed017
fe004|okay.|S|Bed017
mn059|and um um|F|Bed017
fe004|right.|S|Bed017
mn059|and basically what i what i envision is that you rather than just supplying a bunch of keywords you could basically for for an f a q for example you could state sort of like a logic condition when this document applies.|S|Bed017
mn059|so this document explains how to set up your uh mail account on linux or something like this.|S|Bed017
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
mn059|so so something something very specific that you can then|D|Bed017
mn059|but the i think that the key point with these uh learning systems is that uh a learning system is only as good as uh the amount of content it it carries.|S|Bed017
fe004|huh.|B|Bed017
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
mn059|you can have the best learning system with the best search interface.|S|Bed017
mn059|if there's no content inside of it it's not very useful.|S|Bed017
mn059|so i think ultimately because um uh developing these these rules and these inference uh inferences i think is very costly.|S|Bed017
mn059|so um uh i think you must be able to reuse some some existing um domain domain information or or or ontologies that that uh other people wrote.|S|Bed017
mn059|and then try to integrate them.|S|Bed017
mn059|and then also search the entire web basically rather than just the small uh content management system.|S|Bed017
fe004|okay.|B|Bed017
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
mn059|so i think that's that's crucial for for the success of or|D|Bed017
fe004|so you're not|D|Bed017
fe004|i guess i'm trying to figure out how how it maps to the kinds of things that we've talked about in this group and actually associated groups.|S|Bed017
mn059|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
fe004|because some of us do pretty detailed linguistic analyses.|S|Bed017
fe004|and i'm guessing that you you won't be doing that.|S|Bed017
mn059|no.|S|Bed017
fe004|okay.|S|Bed017
fe004|just checking.|S|Bed017
fe004|so okay|F|Bed017
mn015|huh|B|Bed017
mn059|no.|S|Bed017
fe004|so you take the query and and|D|Bed017
me010|on the other hand uh framenet could well be useful.|S|Bed017
me010|so do you know the framenet story?|Q|Bed017
mn059|um yeah.|S|Bed017
mn059|uh not not too much.|S|Bed017
me010|okay.|S|Bed017
mn059|but uh|D|Bed017
me010|oh that's another thing you might want to look into while you're here.|S|Bed017
mn059|i have a rough overview.|S|Bed017
me010|because um you know the standard story is that keyworks keywords evoke frames and the frames may well give you additional keywords.|S|Bed017
me010|or uh if you know that that that a a bunch of keywords uh indicate a frame then you can find documents that actually have the whole frame rather than just uh individual|D|Bed017
mn059|huh huh|B|Bed017
me010|so there's a lot of stuff.|S|Bed017
me010|and people are looking at that.|S|Bed017
me010|most of the work here is just trying to get the frames right.|S|Bed017
me010|there's linguists and stuff.|S|Bed017
me010|and there's a lot of it.|S|Bed017
me010|and they're they're busily working away.|S|Bed017
me010|but there are some application efforts trying to exploit it.|S|Bed017
me010|and this looks it seems to be that this is a place where you might be able to do that.|S|Bed017
mn059|yeah yeah.|S|Bed017
mn059|yeah i'm sure i could learn a lot about um yeah just how to how to come up with these structures.|S|Bed017
fe004|huh|B|Bed017
mn059|because it's it's very easy to whip up something quickly.|S|Bed017
mn059|but it maybe then makes sense to to me but not to anybody else.|S|Bed017
mn059|and and if we want to share and integrate things they must well they must be well designed really.|S|Bed017
mn015|remember the uh prashant story?|Q|Bed017
me010|right.|S|Bed017
mn015|the absolutely no no linguistic background person that the i u sent over here.|S|Bed017
me010|right.|S|Bed017
mn015|and andreas and i tried to come up or we had come up actually with a uh with him working on an interface for framenet as it was back then that would do some of the work for this machine.|S|Bed017
me010|right.|S|Bed017
me010|yeah.|B|Bed017
mn015|which uh never got done because prashant found a happy occupation.|S|Bed017
me010|yeah i know i mean it it he he did what what he did was much more sensible for him.|S|Bed017
mn015|which in the|D|Bed017
me010|i think uh|D|Bed017
mn015|absolutely yeah.|S|Bed017
mn015|but so i'm just saying the uh we had that idea.|S|Bed017
me010|you know|F|Bed017
me010|yeah.|F|Bed017
me010|the idea was there yeah okay.|S|Bed017
mn015|uh to to exploit framenet there as well.|S|Bed017
me010|yeah.|B|Bed017
fe004|huh|B|Bed017
mn015|and um|F|Bed017
me010|yeah actually you guys never|D|Bed017
mn015|and srini's doing information extraction also.|S|Bed017
mn015|right?|Q|Bed017
me010|right.|S|Bed017
mn015|with that framenet base.|S|Bed017
mn059|huh|B|Bed017
me010|yeah.|B|Bed017
me010|so you you guys never sent anybody else from i u.|S|Bed017
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
me010|you were no|D|Bed017
mn059|except except prashant?|Q|Bed017
me010|yeah.|S|Bed017
me010|uh this was supposedly an exchange program.|S|Bed017
mn059|um|F|Bed017
me010|and i we you know it's fine we don't care.|S|Bed017
me010|but it just i'm a little surprised that uh andreas didn't come up with anyone else he wanted to send.|S|Bed017
me010|all right.|B|Bed017
mn059|uh i don't know i mean the uh|D|Bed017
me010|i mean i had forgotten i to be honest with you i'd totally forgotten we had a program.|S|Bed017
fe004|huh|B|Bed017
mn015|uh it's in the program?|Q|Bed017
mn059|uh i i think it's it's really the lack of students uh at i u at the moment.|S|Bed017
me010|yeah.|S|Bed017
me010|yeah.|F|Bed017
me010|no no there was a whole there was a little contract signed.|S|Bed017
me010|it was|D|Bed017
me010|yeah.|B|Bed017
mn059|yeah yeah i think it's it's more the lack of of students really.|S|Bed017
mn059|and we have all these sponsors that are always sort of eager to get some teams.|S|Bed017
me010|yeah i know.|S|Bed017
fe004|huh|B|Bed017
me010|right.|S|Bed017
mn059|but|F|Bed017
me010|right.|B|Bed017
mn059|well i mean if if i were a student i'd love to come here rather than work for some german company or|D|Bed017
me010|yeah.|B|Bed017
me010|right.|B|Bed017
mn015|you are being recorded right now so beware.|S|Bed017
me010|oh right!|S|Bed017
mn059|well i didn't say anybody to anything to offend.|S|Bed017
mn059|well except for the sponsors maybe.|S|Bed017
mn059|but|F|Bed017
me010|right.|B|Bed017
me010|anyway.|B|Bed017
me010|right so i that's that's one of the things that might be worth looking into while you're here.|S|Bed017
mn059|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
me010|uh unfortunately srini who is heavily involved in daml and all this sort of stuff is himself out of town.|S|Bed017
mn059|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
mn059|well i'll go to the uh semantic web workshop uh in two weeks.|S|Bed017
me010|right.|S|Bed017
me010|and|F|Bed017
me010|yeah for for some reason he's not doing that.|S|Bed017
fe004|yeah.|S|Bed017
me010|i don't know why he|D|Bed017
fe004|well he had other things to do.|S|Bed017
me010|oh i who knows?|Q|Bed017
me010|yeah you'll see you'll certainly see a lot of the people there.|S|Bed017
fe004|the uh|D|Bed017
fe004|the other person i thought of is dan gildea.|S|Bed017
fe004|because he did some work on topic spotting|D|Bed017
me010|yeah.|S|Bed017
me010|statistical stuff.|S|Bed017
me010|that would be a very good idea.|S|Bed017
fe004|um which is i mean you i mean i don't depending on how well you want to integrate with that end|D|Bed017
mn059|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
fe004|you know like taking the data and you said the learning systems that figure out|D|Bed017
fe004|we there's someone in icsi who actually has been working on has worked on that kind of stuff.|S|Bed017
fe004|and he's worked with frame net.|S|Bed017
fe004|so you could talk to him about you know both of those things at once.|S|Bed017
mn059|uhhuh uhhuh|B|Bed017
fe004|so|F|Bed017
fe004|and he just finished writing a draft of his thesis.|S|Bed017
fe004|so|F|Bed017
mn059|so uh who is that again?|Q|Bed017
fe004|dan gildea g i l d e a.|S|Bed017
fe004|and he's in one of the rooms on the fifth floor and stuff.|S|Bed017
mn015|who?|Q|Bed017
mn015|i can take you to his office.|S|Bed017
mn015|it's just around the corner.|S|Bed017
fe004|and|F|Bed017
mn059|okay great.|S|Bed017
fe004|huh|B|Bed017
fe004|well if you solve the problem hope you can do one for us too.|S|Bed017
me010|all right was there anything else for this?|Q|Bed017
me010|one of these times soon we're going to hear about construal.|S|Bed017
mn015|yeah i'm sure.|S|Bed017
mn015|i have um i think it was november two thousand three or some|D|Bed017
mn015|no i had something in my calendar.|S|Bed017
me010|oh okay right.|S|Bed017
mn015|um|F|Bed017
me003|wait a second.|S|Bed017
me003|that's a long way away.|S|Bed017
me010|good thinking!|S|Bed017
mn015|uh well maybe i can i can bribe my way out of this.|S|Bed017
mn015|so|F|Bed017
mn015|so i did some double checking.|S|Bed017
mn015|and it seems like spring break in two thousand one|D|Bed017
fe004|talk about changing the topic.|S|Bed017
mn015|no.|S|Bed017
me010|well no but he's he's he's he's as you said he's like the state legislature he's trying to offer us bribes.|S|Bed017
fe004|at least this is a private meeting.|S|Bed017
fe004|right exactly.|S|Bed017
fe004|okay that's the link.|S|Bed017
mn015|this uh oh they refused the budget again?|Q|Bed017
mn015|is it so about citris?|Q|Bed017
mn015|yeah still nothing.|S|Bed017
me010|uh this this this the|D|Bed017
me010|we're uh involved in a literally three hundred million dollar uh program.|S|Bed017
me010|uh with the state of california.|S|Bed017
me010|and the state of california is now a month and a half behind its its legally required date to approve a budget.|S|Bed017
me010|so the budget has not been approved.|S|Bed017
me010|and two days ago there's two you know so two branches of legislature one branch approved it.|S|Bed017
mn059|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
me010|and um|F|Bed017
me010|yesterday day there was this uh uh i thought that the other branch would just approve it.|S|Bed017
me010|but now there's actually a little back sliding to people who who approved it got flak from there.|S|Bed017
me010|uh anyway.|S|Bed017
me010|so um|F|Bed017
me010|oh i have to tell you a wonderful story about this.|S|Bed017
me010|okay?|Q|Bed017
me010|and then we'll go.|S|Bed017
me010|so i it turns out i wound up having lunch today with a guy named tom kalil.|S|Bed017
me010|k i l l.|S|Bed017
me010|k a l i l.|S|Bed017
me010|and uh he now works at berkeley.|S|Bed017
me010|in fact he's hired to run a lot of citris.|S|Bed017
me010|even though we don't have the money they so they've been hiring people right and left.|S|Bed017
me010|so uh they think the money's coming.|S|Bed017
me010|so and he was i think the chief staffer to clinton on technology matters.|S|Bed017
me010|he was in the white house.|S|Bed017
me010|i don't remember what he was saying.|S|Bed017
me010|anyway like that.|S|Bed017
me010|and is now doing all the politics for citris.|S|Bed017
me010|but also has a uh a lot of interest in uh actually doing things for society.|S|Bed017
me010|so digital divide and stuff like that.|S|Bed017
me010|so that's interesting to me but maybe not to you.|S|Bed017
me010|but the really interesting thing was he he he said something about you know i'm interested in things that have high social multiplier.|S|Bed017
me010|something that is of great social value.|S|Bed017
me010|he said for example|S|Bed017
me010|this was his only example.|S|Bed017
me010|if you had a adult literacy program that was as good as an individual tutor.|S|Bed017
me010|and as compelling as a video game.|S|Bed017
me010|then that would have a huge social impact.|S|Bed017
me010|i said oh great that's a good problem to work on.|S|Bed017
me010|anyway so it was nice that uh he's got this view of a that's what you should try to do and b uh language would be a good way to do it.|S|Bed017
me010|so that's|D|Bed017
fe004|huh definitely.|S|Bed017
me010|so anyway that's the end of the story.|S|Bed017
fe004|but for adults and not for the children.|S|Bed017
me010|this was|D|Bed017
me010|yeah i didn't push him on the on the child thing.|S|Bed017
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
me010|but uh|F|Bed017
me010|you know again if if you if you|D|Bed017
fe004|oh.|S|Bed017
me010|um|F|Bed017
me010|and this was this was literacy.|S|Bed017
me010|which actually is somewhat different problem.|S|Bed017
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
me010|maybe easier.|S|Bed017
me010|i don't know.|S|Bed017
me010|so this is reading rather than teaching.|S|Bed017
me010|another project we started on and and didn't get funded for was uh to try to build an automatic tutoring program for kids whose first language wasn't english.|S|Bed017
me010|which is like half the school population in california.|S|Bed017
me010|something like that.|S|Bed017
me010|isn't it?|Q|Bed017
fe004|uhhuh.|S|Bed017
me010|yeah.|S|Bed017
me010|so|F|Bed017
me010|enormous problem in california.|S|Bed017
me010|and the idea was if we're so smart about language understanding and speech understanding couldn't we build uh programs that would be tutors for the kids.|S|Bed017
me010|we think we could.|S|Bed017
me010|anyway so so but this is a slightly different problem.|S|Bed017
fe004|uhhuh.|B|Bed017
me010|and|F|Bed017
me010|um|F|Bed017
me010|i know none of us have the spare time to look at it right now.|S|Bed017
me010|but it it's it's interesting.|S|Bed017
me010|and i may um talk to him some more about is somebody already doing this and stuff like that.|S|Bed017
me010|so anyway that was that was today's little story.|S|Bed017
me003|huh|B|Bed017
mn015|okay so i i did manage to get pull my head out of the sling by sidetracking into citris.|S|Bed017
me010|no no.|S|Bed017
mn015|but uh or temporarily putting it out of the sling.|S|Bed017
me010|right.|B|Bed017
mn015|but i i'll volunteer to put it right back in by stating that i am uh among some other things in the process of writing up stuff that we have been discussing at our daily meetings.|S|Bed017
me010|yeah.|S|Bed017
mn015|and also revising|D|Bed017
mn015|thanks for all the comments.|S|Bed017
mn015|the the original construal proposal.|S|Bed017
mn015|and if i put one and one together i may end up with a number that's greater than one and that i i can potentially present once you get back.|S|Bed017
fe004|greater than two?|Q|Bed017
me010|you're good.|S|Bed017
mn015|nnn sometimes you know the sum is not uh less than the|D|Bed017
fe004|uh right right.|S|Bed017
me010|right.|B|Bed017
me010|right.|B|Bed017
me010|anyway yeah so okay so that'd be great.|S|Bed017
me010|but i'd i think it's it's time again.|S|Bed017
me010|right?|Q|Bed017
mn015|absolutely yeah.|S|Bed017
me010|yeah okay.|S|Bed017
mn015|but um and hopefully all sidetracking um other things will have disappeared soon.|S|Bed017
me010|good.|S|Bed017
me010|yep.|S|Bed017
me010|done?|Q|Bed017
