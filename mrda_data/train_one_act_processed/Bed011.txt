mn015|all right.|B|Bed011
me010|yeah let's get started.|S|Bed011
me010|um hopefully nancy will come.|S|Bed011
me010|if not she won't.|S|Bed011
me045|uh robert do you uh have any way to turn off your uh screensaver on there so that it's not going off every uh|D|Bed011
me045|it seems to have about at two minute|D|Bed011
mn015|yeah i've i uh it's not that i didn't try.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|B|Bed011
mn015|and um i i told it to stay on forever and ever but if it's not plugged in it just doesn't obey my commands.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|S|Bed011
mn015|it has a mind.|S|Bed011
me045|got it.|S|Bed011
fe046|wants to conserve.|S|Bed011
mn015|but i i just you know sort of keep on wiggling.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah okay.|D|Bed011
mn015|but uh we'll just be working on it at intensity so it doesn't happen.|S|Bed011
mn015|we'll see.|B|Bed011
mn015|should we plunge right into it?|Q|Bed011
me010|yeah.|S|Bed011
mn015|so would you like to|D|Bed011
me010|i think so.|S|Bed011
mn015|so what i've tried to do here is list all the decision nodes that we have identified on this side.|S|Bed011
mn015|commented and what they're about and sort of the properties we may um give them.|S|Bed011
mn015|and here are the uh tasks to be implemented via our data collection.|S|Bed011
mn015|so all of these tasks|D|Bed011
mn015|the reading is out of these tasks more or less imply that the user wants to go there sometime or the other.|S|Bed011
mn015|and analogously for example here we have our eva um intention.|S|Bed011
mn015|and these are the data tasks where we can assume the person would like to enter view or just approach the thing.|S|Bed011
mn015|analogously the same on the object information.|S|Bed011
mn015|we can see that you know we have sort of created these tasks before we came up with our decision nodes.|S|Bed011
mn015|so there's a lot of things where we have no analogous tasks and that may or may not be a problem.|S|Bed011
mn015|we can change the tasks slightly if we feel that we should have data for sort of for every decision node.|S|Bed011
mn015|so trying to um implant the intention of going to a place now going to a place later on the same tour.|S|Bed011
mn015|or trying to plant the intention of going sometime on the next tour or the next day or whenever.|S|Bed011
me010|right right.|B|Bed011
mn015|but i think that might be overdoing it a little.|S|Bed011
me010|so yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|so let me pop up a level.|S|Bed011
me010|and uh make sure that we're all oriented the same.|S|Bed011
me010|so what we're going to do today is two related things.|S|Bed011
me010|uh one of them is to work on the semantics of the belief net which is going to be the main inference engine for the system uh making decisions.|S|Bed011
me010|and decisions are going to turn out to be parameter choices for calls on other modules.|S|Bed011
me010|so the natural language understanding thing is uh we think going to only have to choose parameters but you know a fairly large set of parameters.|S|Bed011
me010|so to do that we need to do two things.|S|Bed011
me010|one of which is figure out what all the choices are which we've done a fair amount.|S|Bed011
me010|then we need to figure out what influences its choices.|S|Bed011
me010|and finally we have to do some technical work on the actual belief relations and presumably estimates of the probabilities and stuff.|S|Bed011
me010|but we aren't going to do the probability stuff today.|S|Bed011
me010|technical stuff we'll do uh another day.|S|Bed011
me010|probably next week.|S|Bed011
me010|but we are going to worry about all the decisions and the things that that contribute to them.|S|Bed011
me010|and we're also sort of uh in the same process going to work with fey on what there should be in the dialogues.|S|Bed011
me010|so one of the steps that's coming up real soon is to actually get subjects uh in here and have them actually record like this.|S|Bed011
me010|uh record dialogues more or less.|S|Bed011
me010|and depending on what fey sort of provokes them to say we'll get information on different things.|S|Bed011
me010|so|D|Bed011
mn015|well how people phrase different intentions more or less.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah people with the phrase them.|S|Bed011
mn015|huh?|Q|Bed011
me010|and so uh for you know keith and people worrying about what constructions people use uh we have some we have some ways to affect that by the way the dialogues go.|S|Bed011
me010|so what robert kindly did is to lay out a table of the kinds of uh things that that might come up.|S|Bed011
me010|and the kinds of decisions.|S|Bed011
me010|so the uh uh on the left are decision nodes and discreet values.|S|Bed011
me010|so if if we're right you can get by with um just this middle column worth of decisions.|S|Bed011
me010|and it's not all that many and it's perfectly feasible technically to build belief nets that will do that.|S|Bed011
me010|and he has a handout.|S|Bed011
mn015|yeah.|F|Bed011
mn015|maybe it was too fast plunging in there because we have two updates.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|S|Bed011
mn015|um you can look at this if you want.|S|Bed011
mn015|these are what our subject's going to have to fill out.|S|Bed011
mn015|any comments i can can still be made and the changes will be put in correspondingly.|S|Bed011
fe046|yes.|B|Bed011
mn015|let me summarize in two sentences.|S|Bed011
mn015|mainly for eva's benefit who probably has not heard about the data collection at all.|D|Bed011
fn050|okay.|D|Bed011
mn015|or have you heard about it?|Q|Bed011
fn050|not that much.|S|Bed011
mn015|no.|S|Bed011
fn050|you didn't|D|Bed011
mn015|okay we were going to put this in front of people.|S|Bed011
mn015|they give us some information on themselves.|S|Bed011
fn050|okay.|B|Bed011
mn015|then then they will read uh a task where lots of german words are sort of thrown in between.|S|Bed011
mn015|and um and they have to read isolated proper names.|S|Bed011
mn015|and these change|D|Bed011
me010|i don't see a release|D|Bed011
mn015|no this is not the release form.|S|Bed011
mn015|this is the speaker information form.|S|Bed011
me010|got it.|S|Bed011
me010|okay fine.|S|Bed011
me010|okay.|S|Bed011
mn015|the release form is over there in that box.|S|Bed011
me010|all right fair enough.|S|Bed011
mn015|and um and then they going to have to um um choose from one of these tasks which are listed here.|S|Bed011
mn015|they they pick a couple.|S|Bed011
mn015|say three uh uh six as a matter of fact.|S|Bed011
mn015|six different things they sort of think they would do if they were in heidelberg or traveling someplace.|S|Bed011
mn015|and um and they have a map.|S|Bed011
me045|huh.|B|Bed011
mn015|like this.|S|Bed011
mn015|very sketchy simplified map.|S|Bed011
mn015|and they can take notes on that map.|S|Bed011
mn015|and then they call this computer system that works perfectly and understands everything.|S|Bed011
fn050|okay.|B|Bed011
mn015|and um|F|Bed011
mn015|the yeah the computer system sits right in front of you.|S|Bed011
me045|this is a fictional system obviously.|S|Bed011
me045|huh?|Q|Bed011
mn015|that's fey.|S|Bed011
fe046|i've i understand everything.|S|Bed011
me010|and she does know everything.|S|Bed011
fe046|yes i do.|S|Bed011
mn015|and she has a way of making this machine talk.|S|Bed011
mn015|so she can copy sentences into a window or type really fast.|S|Bed011
mn015|and this machine will use speech synthesis to produce that.|S|Bed011
mn015|so if you ask how do i get to the castle then a several seconds later it'll come out of here in order to get to the castle you do|D|Bed011
mn015|okay?|Q|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
mn015|and um and then after three tasks the system breaks down.|S|Bed011
mn015|and fey comes on the phone as a human operator.|S|Bed011
mn015|and says sorry the system broke down but let's continue.|S|Bed011
mn015|and we sort of get the idea what people do when they think they speak to a machine and what people say when they think they speak to a human or know or assume they speak to a human.|S|Bed011
fn050|okay.|B|Bed011
fn050|huh.|B|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
mn015|that's the data collection.|S|Bed011
mn015|and um and fey has some thirty subjects lined up?|Q|Bed011
mn015|something|D|Bed011
fe046|yeah.|S|Bed011
fe046|and more and more every day.|S|Bed011
mn015|and um and they're ready uh to roll.|S|Bed011
mn015|and we're going to start tomorrow at three?|Q|Bed011
mn015|four?|Q|Bed011
mn015|one?|Q|Bed011
fe046|tomorrow|D|Bed011
fe046|well we don't know for sure.|S|Bed011
fe046|because we don't know whether that person is coming or not.|S|Bed011
mn015|okay.|S|Bed011
fe046|but|F|Bed011
mn015|around four-ish.|S|Bed011
mn015|and um we're still looking for a room on the sixth floor because they stole away that conference room um behind our backs.|S|Bed011
mn015|but|D|Bed011
me010|well there are these uh uh|D|Bed011
me010|oh i see we have to|D|Bed011
me010|yeah it's tricky.|S|Bed011
me010|we'll let's let we'll do that off line okay.|S|Bed011
mn015|yeah but i it's happening.|S|Bed011
mn015|david and and jane and and lila are working on that as we speak.|S|Bed011
me010|okay.|B|Bed011
mn015|okay.|S|Bed011
mn015|that was the uh the data collection in a nutshell.|S|Bed011
mn015|and um i can report a so i did this but i also tried to do this|D|Bed011
mn015|so if i click on here|D|Bed011
mn015|isn't this wonderful?|Q|Bed011
mn015|we get to the uh uh belief net just focusing on on the go there node.|S|Bed011
mn015|uh analogously this would be sort of the reason node and the timing node and so forth.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
mn015|and what what happened is that um design wise i'd sort of noticed that we can we still get a lot of errors from a lot of points to one of these sub go there user go there situation nodes.|S|Bed011
mn015|so i came up with a couple of additional nodes here where um|D|Bed011
mn015|whether the user is thrifty or not and what his budget is currently like is going to result in some financial state of the user.|S|Bed011
mn015|how much will he is he willing to spend?|Q|Bed011
mn015|or can spend.|S|Bed011
mn015|being the same at this just the money available which may influence us whether he wants to go there.|S|Bed011
mn015|if it is you know charging tons of dollars for admission or its going to cost a lot of|D|Bed011
mn015|whatever.|S|Bed011
mn015|twenty two million to fly to international space station you know.|S|Bed011
me010|right.|B|Bed011
mn015|just not all people can do that.|S|Bed011
mn015|so and this actually turned out to be pretty key because having specified sort of these uh this this intermediate level um and sort of noticing that everything that happens here|D|Bed011
mn015|let's go to our favorite endpoint one.|S|Bed011
mn015|is again more or less we have um|D|Bed011
mn015|then the situation nodes contributing to the the endpoint situation node which contributes to the endpoint and so forth.|S|Bed011
mn015|um i can now sort of draw straight lines from these to here meaning it of course goes where the sub s.|S|Bed011
mn015|everything that comes from situation everything that comes from user goes with the sub u.|S|Bed011
mn015|and whatever we specify for the so called keith node or the discourse what comes from the um parser construction parser um will contribute to the d and the ontology to the sub o node.|S|Bed011
mn015|and um one just sort of has to watch which also final decision node so it doesn't make sense to figure out whether he wants to enter view or approach an object if he never wants to go there in the first place.|S|Bed011
mn015|but this makes the design thing fairly simple.|S|Bed011
mn015|and um now all that's left to do then is the c p g's the conditional probabilities for the likelihood of a person having enough money actually wanting to go a place if it costs you know this or that.|S|Bed011
mn015|and um okay.|S|Bed011
mn015|and once um bhaskara has finished his classwork that's where we're going to end up doing.|S|Bed011
mn015|you get involved in that process too.|S|Bed011
mn015|and um and for now uh the the question is how much of these decisions do we want to build in explicitly into our data collection?|Q|Bed011
mn015|so um one could sort of think of|D|Bed011
mn015|you know we could call the see or you know people who visit the zoo.|S|Bed011
mn015|we could call it visit the zoo tomorrow.|S|Bed011
mn015|so we have an intention of seeing something but not now but later.|S|Bed011
me010|right.|B|Bed011
me010|yeah.|F|Bed011
me010|yeah so let's uh see i i think that from one point of view uh um all these places are the same.|S|Bed011
me010|so that that um in terms of the linguistics and stuff there may be a few different kinds of places.|S|Bed011
me010|so i it seems to me that we ought to decide you know what things are are actually going to matter to us.|S|Bed011
me010|and um so the zoo and the university and the castle et cetera um are all big-ish things that um you know have different parts to them and one of them might be fine.|S|Bed011
mn015|huh.|B|Bed011
mn015|huh huh.|B|Bed011
me010|and|D|Bed011
mn015|yeah the the reason why we did it that way as a as a reminder is uh no person is going to do all of them.|S|Bed011
mn015|they're just going to select um according to their preferences.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah yeah.|F|Bed011
mn015|uh yeah i usually visit zoos or i usually visit castles or i usually|D|Bed011
mn015|and then you pick that one.|S|Bed011
me010|right no no.|S|Bed011
me010|but but point is to to to build a system that's got everything in it that might happen you do one thing.|S|Bed011
fe046|they're redundant.|S|Bed011
me010|to build a system that um had the most data on a relatively confined set of things you do something else.|S|Bed011
me010|and the speech people for example are going to do better if they if things come up uh repeatedly.|S|Bed011
me010|now of course if everybody says exactly the same thing then it's not interesting.|S|Bed011
me010|so all i'm saying is there's there's a kind of question of what we're trying to accomplish.|S|Bed011
me010|and i think my temptation for the data gathering would be to uh|D|Bed011
me010|you know and each person is only going to do it once.|S|Bed011
me010|so you don't have to worry about them being bored.|S|Bed011
me010|so if if it's one service one luxury item you know one big-ish place and so forth and so on um then my guess is that that the data is going to be easier to handle.|S|Bed011
me010|now of course you have this i guess possible danger that somehow there're certain constructions that people use uh when talking about a museum that they wouldn't talk about with a university and stuff.|D|Bed011
me010|um but i guess i'm i uh my temptation is to go for simpler.|S|Bed011
me010|you know less variation.|S|Bed011
me010|but i don't know what other people think about this in terms of|D|Bed011
me010|uh|F|Bed011
me045|so i don't exactly understand|D|Bed011
me045|like i i i guess we're trying to limit the detail of our ontology or types of places that someone could go.|S|Bed011
me045|right?|Q|Bed011
me045|but who is it that has to care about this?|Q|Bed011
me045|or what component of the system?|Q|Bed011
me010|oh.|S|Bed011
me010|well uh i think there are two places where it comes up.|S|Bed011
me010|one is uh in the these people who are going to take this and and try to do speech with it.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
me010|uh lots of pronunciations of of the same thing are going to give you better data than you know a few pronunciations of lots more things.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|B|Bed011
me010|that's one.|S|Bed011
me045|so we would rather just ask uh have a bunch of people talk about the zoo.|S|Bed011
me045|uh and assume that that will that the constructions that they use there will give us everything we need to know about these sort of zoo castle whatever type things these bigger places.|S|Bed011
me010|bigger.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah well this is a question for|D|Bed011
me045|and that way you get the speech data of people saying zoo over and over again or whatever too.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|F|Bed011
me045|okay.|S|Bed011
me010|so this is a question for you.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
me010|and you know if we if we do and we probably will actually try to uh build a prototype uh|D|Bed011
me010|probably we could get by with the prototype only handling a few of them anyway.|S|Bed011
me010|so um|F|Bed011
mn015|yeah this was sort of these are all different sort of activities.|S|Bed011
mn015|um but i think i i got the point and i think i like it.|S|Bed011
mn015|we can do put them in a more hierarchical fashion.|S|Bed011
mn015|so go to place and then give them a choice.|S|Bed011
mn015|you know either they're the symphony type or opera type or the tourist site guide type or the nightclub disco type person and they say yeah this is on that go to big-ish place.|S|Bed011
mn015|this is what i would do.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
mn015|and then we have the fix thing and then maybe do something the other day thing.|S|Bed011
mn015|so my question is|D|Bed011
mn015|i guess to some extent we should we just have to try it out and see if it works.|S|Bed011
mn015|it would be challenging in in a sense to try to make it so so complex that they even really should schedule or to plan it uh a more complex thing in terms of|D|Bed011
mn015|okay.|F|Bed011
mn015|you know they should get the feeling that there are these six things they have to do.|S|Bed011
mn015|and they can be done maybe in two days.|S|Bed011
me010|well|F|Bed011
me010|yeah.|F|Bed011
me010|well i think|D|Bed011
mn015|so they make these decisions.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|F|Bed011
mn015|can i go there tomorrow?|Q|Bed011
mn015|or you know influences.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|F|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
me010|well i think it's easy enough to set that up if that's your expectation.|S|Bed011
me010|so the uh system could say well uh we'd like to to set up your program for two days in heidelberg.|S|Bed011
me010|you know let's first think about all the things you might like to do.|S|Bed011
me010|so there in i mean in i i i'm sure that if that's what you did then they would start telling you about that and then you could get into um various things about ordering if you wanted.|S|Bed011
mn015|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed011
mn015|yeah but i think this is part of the instructor's job.|S|Bed011
mn015|and that can be done sort of to say okay now we've picked these six tasks.|S|Bed011
mn015|now you have you can call the system and you have two days.|S|Bed011
mn015|and|D|Bed011
me010|i'm sorry.|S|Bed011
me010|no we have to help we have to decide.|S|Bed011
me010|fey will carry out whatever we decide.|S|Bed011
me010|but we have to decide you know what is the appropriate scenario.|S|Bed011
me010|that's what we're going to talk about yeah.|S|Bed011
mn015|yep yep.|B|Bed011
mn036|but these are two different scenarios entirely.|S|Bed011
mn036|i mean one is a planner the other it kind of give you instructions on the spot.|S|Bed011
mn015|yeah but the i don't i'm not really interested in sort of phase planning capabilities.|S|Bed011
mn015|but it's more the how do people phrase these planning requests?|Q|Bed011
mn015|so are we going to masquerade the system as this as you said simple response system?|Q|Bed011
mn015|i have one question i get one response.|S|Bed011
mn015|or should we allow for a certain level of complexity?|Q|Bed011
mn015|and i think the data would be nicer if we get temporal references.|S|Bed011
me010|well so keith what do you think?|Q|Bed011
me045|well um it seems that|D|Bed011
me045|yeah i mean|D|Bed011
me045|off the top of my head it kind of seems like you would probably just want you know richer data.|S|Bed011
me045|more complex stuff going on.|S|Bed011
me045|people trying to do more complex sets of things.|S|Bed011
me045|i mean you know if our goal is to really sort of be able to handle a whole bunch of different stuff then throwing harder situations at people will get them to do more linguistic more interesting linguistic stuff.|S|Bed011
me045|but i mean i'm i'm not really sure.|S|Bed011
me045|uh because i don't fully understand like what our choices are of ways to do this here yet.|S|Bed011
mn015|i mean we have tested this and|D|Bed011
mn015|have you heard listen to the first two or|D|Bed011
mn015|as a matter of fact the second person is uh is was faced with exactly this kind of setup.|S|Bed011
mn015|and|D|Bed011
me045|i started to listen to one and it was just like um uh sort of depressing.|S|Bed011
me045|i thought i'd just sort of listen to the beginning part and the person was just sort of reading off her script or something.|S|Bed011
me045|and|D|Bed011
mn015|oh okay.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|B|Bed011
mn015|that was the first subject.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|first one wasn't very good.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed011
me045|so um i|D|Bed011
fe046|although|D|Bed011
mn015|um it is already with this it got pretty with this setup and that particular subject it got pretty complex.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
mn015|maybe i suggest we make some fine tuning of these get sort of run through ten or so subjects.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
mn015|and then take a breather.|S|Bed011
mn015|and see whether we want to make it more complex or not depending on what what sort of results we're getting.|S|Bed011
me045|right.|B|Bed011
me045|yeah.|F|Bed011
me045|it in fact um i am just you know today next couple days going to start really diving into this data.|S|Bed011
me045|i've basically looked at one of the files.|S|Bed011
me045|you know one of these|D|Bed011
me045|you gave me those dozens of files.|S|Bed011
me045|and i looked at one of them which was about ten sentences found fifteen twenty different construction types that we would have to look for and so on.|S|Bed011
me045|and like all right well let's start here.|S|Bed011
me045|um so i haven't really gone into the you know looked at all of the stuff that's going on.|S|Bed011
me045|so i don't really|D|Bed011
me045|right i mean once i start doing that i'll have more to say about this kind of thing.|S|Bed011
me010|okay.|S|Bed011
mn015|and and always|D|Bed011
me010|but well but you did say something important which is that um you can probably keep yourself fairly well occupied uh with the simple cases for quite a while.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|S|Bed011
me010|although obviously so so that does suggest that|D|Bed011
me010|uh now i have looked at all the data and it's it's actually at least to an amateur quite redundant.|S|Bed011
me010|that that it was it was very stylized and quite a lot of people said more or less the same thing.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah yeah.|B|Bed011
me045|i um i did sort of scan it at first and noticed that and then looked in detail at one of them.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|B|Bed011
me045|but yeah yeah i noticed that too.|S|Bed011
me010|so we we we want to do more than that.|S|Bed011
mn015|and with this we're getting more.|S|Bed011
me010|okay.|S|Bed011
mn015|no question.|S|Bed011
me010|right.|B|Bed011
me010|so|D|Bed011
mn015|uh do we want to get going beyond more which is sort of the|D|Bed011
me010|well okay so let's let's take let's i|D|Bed011
me010|i think your suggestion is good which is we'll do a uh a batch.|S|Bed011
me010|okay.|S|Bed011
me010|and uh|F|Bed011
me010|fey how long is it going to be till you have ten subjects?|Q|Bed011
me010|couple days?|Q|Bed011
me010|or a week?|Q|Bed011
me010|or i don't i don't have a feel for|D|Bed011
fe046|um i can yeah i mean i i think can probably schedule ten people uh whenever.|S|Bed011
me010|well it's it's up to you.|S|Bed011
me010|i mean i i uh we don't have any huge time pressure.|S|Bed011
me010|it's just when you have|D|Bed011
fe046|how long will it be?|Q|Bed011
fe046|um i i would say maybe two weeks.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|S|Bed011
me010|oh okay.|S|Bed011
me010|so let's do this.|S|Bed011
me010|let's plan next monday okay to have a review of what we have so far.|S|Bed011
me010|and|D|Bed011
mn015|this means audio but|D|Bed011
me010|huh?|Q|Bed011
mn015|no transcriptions of course.|S|Bed011
me010|no we won't have the transcriptions.|S|Bed011
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|but what we should be able to do|D|Bed011
me010|and i don't know if fey if you will have time to do this.|S|Bed011
me010|but it would be great if you could um not transcribe it all but pick out uh some stuff.|S|Bed011
me010|i mean we could uh just sit here and listen to it all.|S|Bed011
me010|are you going to have the audio on the web site?|Q|Bed011
me010|okay.|S|Bed011
mn015|until we reach the gigabyte thing and david johnson kills me and we're going to put it on the web site yeah.|S|Bed011
me010|oh we could get|D|Bed011
me010|i mean you can buy another disk for two hundred dollars.|S|Bed011
me010|right?|Q|Bed011
me010|i mean it's it's not like|D|Bed011
me010|okay.|B|Bed011
me010|so we'll take care of david johnson.|S|Bed011
me010|okay.|S|Bed011
mn015|no he uh he he has been solving all our problems or is wonderful.|S|Bed011
fe046|take care of him.|S|Bed011
me010|okay.|B|Bed011
mn015|so|D|Bed011
me010|all right.|B|Bed011
me010|so we'll buy a disk.|S|Bed011
me010|but anyway so um if you if you can think of a way to uh point us to to interesting things sort of as you're doing this or or something.|S|Bed011
me010|uh make your make notes or something that that this is you know something worth looking at.|S|Bed011
me010|and other than that yeah i guess we'll just have to uh listen|D|Bed011
me010|although i guess it's only ten minutes each.|S|Bed011
me010|right?|Q|Bed011
me010|roughly.|S|Bed011
fe046|well i guess.|S|Bed011
fe046|i'm not sure how long it's actually going to take.|S|Bed011
mn015|the reading task is a lot shorter.|S|Bed011
mn015|that was cut by fifty percent.|S|Bed011
mn015|and the reading|D|Bed011
mn015|nobody's interested in that except for the speech people.|S|Bed011
me010|right.|S|Bed011
me010|no we don't care about that at all.|S|Bed011
mn015|so|D|Bed011
mn015|it's actually like five minutes dialogue.|S|Bed011
me010|my guess is it's going to be ten.|S|Bed011
me010|people|D|Bed011
mn015|ten minutes is long.|S|Bed011
me010|i understand.|S|Bed011
me010|but people people you know uh|D|Bed011
fe046|it feels like a long time.|S|Bed011
fe046|but|F|Bed011
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|B|Bed011
mn015|it feels like forever when you're doing it.|S|Bed011
mn015|but then it turns out to be three minutes and forty five seconds.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|could be.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|okay.|B|Bed011
me010|i was thinking people would you know hesitate and whatever.|S|Bed011
me010|whatever it is we'll we'll deal with it.|S|Bed011
mn015|yeah it's not|D|Bed011
me010|okay so that'll be that'll be um on on the web page.|S|Bed011
mn015|and it's fun.|S|Bed011
mn015|okay.|B|Bed011
me010|that's great.|S|Bed011
me010|um but anyway yeah so i think it's a good idea to start with the sort of relatively straight forward just response system.|S|Bed011
me010|and then if we want to uh get them to start doing uh multiple step planning with a whole bunch of things and then organize them.|S|Bed011
me010|um|D|Bed011
me010|tell them which things are near each other.|S|Bed011
me010|and|F|Bed011
me010|you know any of that stuff.|S|Bed011
me010|uh you know which things would you like to do tuesday morning.|S|Bed011
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|so yeah i that seems pretty straight forward.|S|Bed011
fe046|but were you saying that|D|Bed011
mn015|i need those back by the way.|S|Bed011
me010|okay.|S|Bed011
fe046|yeah.|B|Bed011
me045|okay.|B|Bed011
mn015|that's for|D|Bed011
me010|i'm sorry fey what?|S|Bed011
fe046|that maybe one thing we should do is go through this list and sort of select things that are categories and then offer only one member of that category?|Q|Bed011
me010|that's what i was suggesting for the first round yeah.|S|Bed011
fe046|okay.|S|Bed011
me045|so rather than having zoo and castle|D|Bed011
fe046|and then i mean they could be alternate versions of the same if you wanted data on different constructions.|S|Bed011
me010|they could but but uh they|D|Bed011
me010|yeah but uh but|D|Bed011
fe046|like one person gets the version with the zoo as a choice and the other person gets the|D|Bed011
me010|you could|D|Bed011
me010|but but i i i think in the short run|D|Bed011
mn015|and|D|Bed011
mn015|no the|D|Bed011
mn015|the person don't get it.|S|Bed011
mn015|i mean this is why we did it because when we gave them just three tasks for part a and three tasks for part b|D|Bed011
me010|right.|B|Bed011
me010|yeah.|B|Bed011
fe046|well no they could still choose.|S|Bed011
fe046|they just wouldn't be able to choose both zoo and say touring the castle.|S|Bed011
mn015|exactly.|S|Bed011
mn015|this is limiting the choices but yeah.|S|Bed011
mn015|right.|S|Bed011
mn015|okay sorry.|S|Bed011
mn015|but um i i think this approach will very well work.|S|Bed011
mn015|but the person was able to look at it and say okay this is what i would actually do.|S|Bed011
fe046|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|okay.|B|Bed011
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed011
mn015|okay.|B|Bed011
fe046|he was vicious.|S|Bed011
mn015|okay we got to we got to disallow uh traveling to zoos and uh castles at the same time sort of|D|Bed011
fe046|i mean there they are significantly different but|D|Bed011
mn015|but no they're i mean they're sort of this is where tour becomes you know|D|Bed011
mn015|tourists maybe a bit different.|S|Bed011
fe046|yeah i guess so.|S|Bed011
mn015|and um these are just places where you you enter um much like here.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|B|Bed011
mn015|but we can uh|D|Bed011
me010|yeah in fact if if if you use the right verb for each in common|D|Bed011
me010|like you know attend a theater symphony or opera is is a group.|S|Bed011
me010|and tour the university castle or zoo.|S|Bed011
mn015|uhhuh yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|all of these do have this kind of tour um aspect about the way you would go to them.|S|Bed011
me010|and uh the movie theater is probably also uh is attend et cetera.|S|Bed011
mn015|attend.|S|Bed011
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed011
me010|so it may turn out to be not so many different kinds of things.|S|Bed011
mn015|huh uhhuh.|B|Bed011
me010|and then what one would expect is that that the sentence types would uh their responses would tend to be grouped according to the kind of activity you would expect.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
mn036|but i mean it seem that um there is a difference between going to see something and things like exchange money or dine out.|S|Bed011
me010|oh absolutely.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|B|Bed011
mn036|uh function yeah.|D|Bed011
mn015|yeah this is where|D|Bed011
mn015|yeah.|F|Bed011
mn015|the function stuff is definitely different and the getting information or stuff yeah.|S|Bed011
mn015|okay.|B|Bed011
mn015|but this is open.|S|Bed011
mn015|so since people going to still pick something we're not going to get any significant amount of redundancy.|S|Bed011
mn015|and for reasons we don't want it really in that sense.|S|Bed011
mn015|and um we would be ultimately more interested in getting all the possible ways of people asking oh for different things with or with a computer.|S|Bed011
mn015|and so if you can think of any other sort of high level tasks a tourist may do just always just mail them to us and we'll sneak them into the collection.|S|Bed011
mn015|we're not going to do much statistical stuff with it.|S|Bed011
me010|we don't have enough.|S|Bed011
mn015|no.|S|Bed011
mn015|but it seems like since we since we are getting towards uh subject uh fifty subjects.|S|Bed011
mn015|and if we can keep it up um to a uh sort of five four-ish per week rate we may even reach the one hundred before fey takes off to chicago.|S|Bed011
fe046|that means that one hundred people have to be interested.|S|Bed011
me045|good luck.|S|Bed011
fe046|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|well um these are all people off campus from campus so far.|S|Bed011
fe046|yeah.|S|Bed011
me010|right?|Q|Bed011
fe046|yeah.|S|Bed011
me010|so we yeah we don't know how many we can get next door at the uh shelter for example.|S|Bed011
me045|huh.|B|Bed011
me010|uh for ten bucks probably quite a few.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
me045|that's right.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|so all right so let's go let's go back then to the the chart with all the decisions and stuff and see how we're doing.|S|Bed011
mn015|yep.|B|Bed011
me010|do do people think that you know this is is going to um cover what we need or should we be thinking about more?|Q|Bed011
mn015|okay in terms of decision nodes?|S|Bed011
me010|yep.|S|Bed011
mn015|i mean go there is is a yes or no.|S|Bed011
mn015|right?|Q|Bed011
me010|yep.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
mn015|i'm also interested in in this property uh line here.|S|Bed011
mn015|so if you look at sorry look at that|D|Bed011
mn015|um timing was um i have these three.|S|Bed011
mn015|do we need a final differentiation there?|Q|Bed011
mn015|now later on the same tour sometimes on the next tour?|Q|Bed011
me045|what's this idea of next tour?|Q|Bed011
me045|i mean|D|Bed011
mn015|it's sort of next day.|S|Bed011
mn015|so you're doing something now and you have planned to do these three four things.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
mn015|and you can do something immediately.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
mn015|you could sort of tag it on to that tour.|S|Bed011
me045|or okay.|S|Bed011
mn015|or you can say this is something i would do i want to do sometime in my life basically.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|F|Bed011
me045|okay.|F|Bed011
me045|so so this tour is sort of just like the idea of current round of of touristness or whatever.|S|Bed011
me010|right.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|F|Bed011
me045|okay.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah probably between stops back at the hotel.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|S|Bed011
me045|got it.|S|Bed011
me010|i mean if you if if you wanted precise about it uh you know|D|Bed011
me045|got it.|S|Bed011
me010|uh and i think that's the way tourists do organize their lives.|S|Bed011
me045|sure sure sure.|S|Bed011
me010|you know okay we'll go back to the hotel and then we'll go off.|S|Bed011
me010|and|F|Bed011
me045|okay.|S|Bed011
mn036|so all tours a tour happens only within one day?|Q|Bed011
me010|yes.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|B|Bed011
mn036|so the next tour will be tomorrow?|Q|Bed011
me010|it|D|Bed011
me010|right.|S|Bed011
me010|for this.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|S|Bed011
me045|just to be totally clear.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|B|Bed011
mn015|well my visit to prague there were some nights where i never went back to the hotel.|S|Bed011
mn015|so whether that counts as a two day tour or not we'll have to think.|S|Bed011
me045|you just spend the whole time at u fleku or something.|S|Bed011
mn036|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|i we will we will not ask you more.|S|Bed011
fe046|right.|S|Bed011
mn036|right.|B|Bed011
fe046|that's enough.|S|Bed011
mn015|i don't know.|S|Bed011
mn015|what is the uh the the english uh um cognate if you want for sankt nimmerlandstag?|Q|Bed011
me045|keine ahnung.|S|Bed011
mn015|sort of we'll do it on when you say on that day it means it'll never happen.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|right.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|B|Bed011
mn015|do you have an expression?|Q|Bed011
mn015|probably you|D|Bed011
me045|not that i know of actually.|S|Bed011
mn015|yeah when hell yep we'll do it when hell freezes over.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|B|Bed011
mn015|so maybe that should be another property in there.|S|Bed011
mn036|right.|B|Bed011
fe046|never.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|yeah.|B|Bed011
mn015|okay.|S|Bed011
mn015|um the reason why why do we go there in the first place|D|Bed011
mn015|i e uh it's either uh for sightseeing for meeting people for running errands or doing business.|S|Bed011
mn015|entertainment is a good one in there i think.|S|Bed011
mn015|i agree.|S|Bed011
me045|so business is supposed to uh be sort of it like professional type stuff?|Q|Bed011
me045|right?|Q|Bed011
me045|or something like that?|Q|Bed011
mn015|yep.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|S|Bed011
me045|um|D|Bed011
mn015|i mean this this is uh an old uh johno thing.|S|Bed011
mn015|he sort of had it in there.|S|Bed011
mn015|who is the the is the person?|Q|Bed011
mn015|so it might be a tourist.|S|Bed011
mn015|it might be a business man who's using the system who wants to sort of go to some|D|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
me045|yeah.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah or or both.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|F|Bed011
me045|yeah i mean like for example my my father is about to travel to prague.|S|Bed011
mn015|yep.|B|Bed011
me045|he'll be there for two weeks.|S|Bed011
me045|he is going to uh|D|Bed011
me045|he's there to teach a course at the business school but he also is touring around.|S|Bed011
me045|and so he may have some mixture of these things.|S|Bed011
me010|huh.|B|Bed011
mn015|yep.|B|Bed011
me010|sure.|B|Bed011
mn015|yep.|B|Bed011
me010|right.|B|Bed011
mn015|he would|D|Bed011
mn036|what what do you have in mind in terms of um socializing?|Q|Bed011
mn036|what kind of activities|D|Bed011
mn015|uh just meeting people basically.|S|Bed011
mn036|oh|D|Bed011
mn015|i want to meet someone somewhere which puts a very heavy constraint on the eva.|S|Bed011
mn015|you know because then if you're meeting somebody at the town hall you're not entering it usually.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
mn015|you're just want to approach it.|S|Bed011
me045|so i mean does this capture like where do you put|D|Bed011
me045|exchange money is an errand.|S|Bed011
me045|right?|Q|Bed011
me045|but what about uh|D|Bed011
me010|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
mn015|yep.|S|Bed011
me045|so like go to a movie is now entertainment.|S|Bed011
me045|dine out is|D|Bed011
mn036|socializing i guess.|S|Bed011
me010|no i i|D|Bed011
me010|well i don't know.|S|Bed011
me010|let let well we'll put it somewhere.|S|Bed011
me045|so i mean|D|Bed011
me010|but but um|D|Bed011
me045|right.|B|Bed011
me010|i would say that if dine out is a special uh|D|Bed011
me010|if you're doing it for that purpose then it's entertainment.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|and we'll also as as you'll further along we'll get into business about well you're you know this is going over a meal time.|S|Bed011
me010|do you want to stop for a meal or pick up food or something?|Q|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
me010|and that's different.|S|Bed011
me010|that's that's sort of part of that's not a destination reason that's sort of en passant right.|S|Bed011
me045|right.|S|Bed011
mn015|that goes with the energy depletion function blech.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|right yeah.|B|Bed011
mn015|okay endpoint|D|Bed011
me045|tourist needs food badly.|S|Bed011
me010|right.|B|Bed011
mn015|endpoint is pretty clear.|S|Bed011
mn015|um mode.|S|Bed011
mn015|uh i have found three.|S|Bed011
mn015|drive there walk there uh or be driven which means bus taxi bart.|S|Bed011
me010|okay.|S|Bed011
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed011
mn015|yep.|S|Bed011
me010|obviously taxis are very different than buses.|S|Bed011
me010|but on the other hand the system doesn't have any public transport this the planner system doesn't have any public transport in it yet.|S|Bed011
mn015|so this granularity would suffice i think if we say the person|D|Bed011
mn015|probably based on the utterance we on the situation we can conclude|D|Bed011
mn015|wants to drive there walk there or use some other form of transportation.|S|Bed011
me045|how much of heidelberg can you get around by public transport?|Q|Bed011
me045|i mean in terms of the interesting bits.|S|Bed011
me045|there's lots of bits where you don't really|D|Bed011
me045|i've only was there ten years ago for a day so i don't remember but|D|Bed011
me010|well|D|Bed011
me045|i mean like the sort of the touristy bits|D|Bed011
mn015|everywhere.|S|Bed011
me045|is it like|D|Bed011
me010|you can't get to the philosophers' way very well.|S|Bed011
me010|but|D|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|i mean there are hikes that you can't get to.|S|Bed011
me010|but|D|Bed011
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed011
me045|okay.|B|Bed011
me010|but i think other things you can if i remember right.|S|Bed011
fn050|so is like biking there part of like driving there?|Q|Bed011
mn015|yeah um we actually biking should be should be a separate point because we have a very strong bicycle planning component.|S|Bed011
fn050|or|D|Bed011
me010|oh!|S|Bed011
mn015|so|D|Bed011
fe046|huh that's good.|S|Bed011
mn015|um|D|Bed011
me010|put it in.|S|Bed011
mn015|bicycles should be in there.|S|Bed011
mn015|but|D|Bed011
mn015|will we have|D|Bed011
mn015|i mean is this realistic?|Q|Bed011
mn015|i mean|D|Bed011
me045|yeah.|S|Bed011
me010|okay we can leave it out i guess.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
mn015|we can we can sort of uh drive|D|Bed011
me045|i would i would lump it with walk because hills matter.|S|Bed011
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed011
me045|right?|Q|Bed011
me045|you know.|S|Bed011
me045|things like that.|S|Bed011
mn015|yeah.|D|Bed011
me010|okay.|B|Bed011
me010|skateboards.|S|Bed011
me010|right?|Q|Bed011
mn036|right.|B|Bed011
me010|anyway.|S|Bed011
me010|scooters.|S|Bed011
me010|right?|Q|Bed011
mn015|yep.|B|Bed011
me010|all right.|S|Bed011
mn015|okay length is um you want to get this over with as fast as possible.|S|Bed011
mn015|you want to use some part of what of the time you have.|S|Bed011
mn015|um they can.|S|Bed011
mn015|but we should just make a decision whether we feel that they want to use some substantial or some fraction of their time.|S|Bed011
mn015|you know they want to do it so badly that they are willing to spend uh you know the necessary and plus time.|S|Bed011
me045|huh.|B|Bed011
mn015|and um|F|Bed011
mn015|and you know if we feel that they want to do nothing but that thing then you know we should point out that to the planner that they probably want to use all the time they have.|S|Bed011
mn015|so stretch out that visit for that.|S|Bed011
me010|uhhuh.|S|Bed011
me045|wow!|S|Bed011
me045|it seems like this would be really hard to guess.|S|Bed011
me045|i mean on the part of the system.|S|Bed011
me045|it seems like it|D|Bed011
me045|i mean you're you're talking about rather than having the user decide this you're supposed we're supposed to figure it out?|Q|Bed011
me010|well|F|Bed011
mn015|the user can always say it but it's just sort of we we hand over these parameters if we make if we have a feeling that they are important.|S|Bed011
me045|overrider.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
mn015|and that we can actually infer them to a significant degree or we ask.|S|Bed011
me010|and|F|Bed011
me010|and yeah and part of the system design is that if it looks to be important and you can't figure it out then you ask.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|S|Bed011
mn015|yeah.|B|Bed011
me045|okay.|S|Bed011
me010|but hopefully you don't ask you know all these things all the time.|S|Bed011
me010|or uh so but there's but definitely a back off position to asking.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
me045|right.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
mn015|and if no no part of the system ever comes up with the idea that this could be important no planner is ever going to ask for it.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
mn015|so and i like the idea that you know sort of|D|Bed011
mn015|jerry pushed this idea from the very beginning that it's part of the understanding business to sort of make a good question of what's sort of important in this general picture what you need|D|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
mn015|if you want to simulate it for example what parameters would you need for the simulation?|Q|Bed011
mn015|and timing uh uh length would definitely be part of it.|S|Bed011
mn015|costs?|Q|Bed011
mn015|little money some money lots of money?|Q|Bed011
me010|uhhuh.|S|Bed011
mn015|actually maybe uh uh so|D|Bed011
mn015|yeah okay.|S|Bed011
mn015|huh?|Q|Bed011
me045|you could say some in there.|S|Bed011
mn036|i must say that this one looks a bit strange to me.|S|Bed011
mn036|um maybe it seems like appropriate if i go to las vegas.|S|Bed011
mn036|well but i decide kind of how much money uh i'm willing to lose.|D|Bed011
mn036|but i as a tourist i'll just paying what's what's more or less is required.|S|Bed011
me010|well no.|S|Bed011
me010|i think there are there're different things where you have a choice.|S|Bed011
fe046|huh.|B|Bed011
me010|for example uh this interacts with am i are you willing to take a taxi?|Q|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
me045|dinner.|S|Bed011
me010|or uh you know if if you're going to the opera are you going to look for the best seats or the peanut gallery?|Q|Bed011
mn036|the best seat or or right.|S|Bed011
me010|or you know?|Q|Bed011
me010|whatever.|S|Bed011
me045|okay so|F|Bed011
me010|so i think there are a variety of things in which um|D|Bed011
me010|tourists really do have different styles eating.|S|Bed011
me010|another one.|S|Bed011
me010|you know?|Q|Bed011
me045|yeah.|S|Bed011
mn036|right that's true.|S|Bed011
fe046|right.|S|Bed011
mn015|the what what my sort of sentiment is they're|D|Bed011
mn015|well i i once had to write a a a a charter a carter for a a student organization.|S|Bed011
mn015|and they had wanted me to define what the quorum is going to be.|S|Bed011
mn015|and i looked at the other ones and they always said ten percent of the student body has to be present at their general meeting otherwise it's not a|D|Bed011
mn015|and i wrote in there enough people have to be there.|S|Bed011
mn015|and it was hotly debated but people agreed with me that everybody probably has a good feeling whether it was a farce a joke or whether there were enough people.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
mn015|and if you go to turkey you will find when people go shopping they will say how much cheese do you want.|S|Bed011
mn015|and they say uh enough.|S|Bed011
mn015|and the and the this used all over the place.|S|Bed011
mn015|because the person selling the cheese knows you know that person has two kids and you know a husband that dislikes cheese so this is enough.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
mn015|and um so the middle part is always sort of the the golden way.|S|Bed011
mn015|right?|Q|Bed011
mn015|so you can you can be really make it as cheap as possible or you can say i want uh you know i don't care.|S|Bed011
me045|money is no object.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
me010|yeah.|B|Bed011
mn015|money is no object.|S|Bed011
mn015|or you say i just want to spend enough.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
mn015|or the sufficient or the appropriate amount.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
mn015|but then again this may turn out to be insufficient for our purposes.|S|Bed011
mn015|but well this is my first guess.|S|Bed011
me045|i mean|D|Bed011
mn015|in much the same way as how how you know should the route be?|Q|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
mn015|should it be the easiest route even if it's a little bit longer?|Q|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|D|Bed011
mn015|no steep inclinations?|Q|Bed011
mn015|go the normal way?|Q|Bed011
mn015|whatever that again means uh or do you does the person want to rough it?|Q|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
me045|i mean so there's a couple of different ways you can interpret these things.|S|Bed011
me045|right?|Q|Bed011
me045|you know i want to go there and i don't care if it's really hard.|S|Bed011
me045|or if you're an extreme sport person you know|D|Bed011
me045|i want to go there and i insist on it being the hard way.|S|Bed011
me010|right.|S|Bed011
me045|right?|Q|Bed011
me045|you know so i assume we're going for the first interpretation.|S|Bed011
fe046|right.|B|Bed011
me045|right?|Q|Bed011
me045|something like|D|Bed011
me045|i'll go|D|Bed011
me045|i mean|D|Bed011
me045|i'd|D|Bed011
me045|i don't know.|S|Bed011
me010|no i think he was going for the second one actually.|S|Bed011
me045|it's different from thing to|D|Bed011
me045|yeah?|Q|Bed011
me010|anyway we'll sort yeah we'll sort that out.|S|Bed011
me045|i i|D|Bed011
me045|okay.|S|Bed011
me010|right.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|absolutely.|S|Bed011
mn015|well this is all sort of um top of my head.|S|Bed011
mn015|no no research behind that.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
mn015|um object information.|S|Bed011
mn015|do i do i want to know anything about that object.|S|Bed011
mn015|is either true or false.|S|Bed011
mn015|and if i care about it being open accessible or not i don't think there's any middle ground there.|S|Bed011
mn015|um either i want to know where it is or not.|S|Bed011
mn015|i want to know about it's history or not.|S|Bed011
mn015|or um i want to know about what it's good for or not.|S|Bed011
mn015|maybe one could put scales in there too.|S|Bed011
mn015|so i want to know a lot about it.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah now|D|Bed011
me010|okay.|S|Bed011
me010|i'm sorry!|S|Bed011
me010|go ahead.|S|Bed011
me010|what were you going to say?|Q|Bed011
mn015|one could put scales in there.|S|Bed011
mn015|so i want to know a lot about the history.|S|Bed011
mn015|just a bit|D|Bed011
me010|yeah right.|S|Bed011
me010|well if we|D|Bed011
me010|right.|S|Bed011
me010|so object becomes entity.|S|Bed011
me010|right?|Q|Bed011
mn015|yep that's true.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah but we don't have to do it now.|S|Bed011
mn015|yep.|S|Bed011
mn015|that was the wrong shortcut anyhow.|S|Bed011
me010|and we think that's it interestingly enough that um you know|D|Bed011
me010|or or or something very close to it is going to be uh going to be enough.|S|Bed011
me010|and|D|Bed011
fe046|still wrong.|S|Bed011
mn015|yeah.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|S|Bed011
me010|all right so um so i think the order of things is that um robert will clean this up a little bit although it looks pretty good.|S|Bed011
me010|and|D|Bed011
mn015|what|D|Bed011
mn015|well this is the part that|D|Bed011
me010|huh?|Q|Bed011
mn015|this is the part that needs the work.|S|Bed011
me010|right.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah so|D|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|right.|S|Bed011
me010|so so um in parallel uh three things are going to happen.|S|Bed011
me010|uh robert and eva and bhaskara are going to actually build a belief net that that um has c p t's and you know tries to infer this from various kinds of information.|S|Bed011
me010|and fey is going to start collecting data.|S|Bed011
me010|and we're going to start thinking about uh what constructions we want to elicit.|S|Bed011
me010|and then it may iterate on uh further data collection to elicit|D|Bed011
me045|do you mean do you mean eliciting particular constructions?|Q|Bed011
me045|or do you mean like what kinds of things we want to get people talking about semantically speaking uh|D|Bed011
me010|well yes.|S|Bed011
me010|both.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|S|Bed011
me010|uh and though for us constructions are primarily semantic.|S|Bed011
me010|right?|Q|Bed011
me045|right.|S|Bed011
me010|and and so uh|D|Bed011
me045|sure.|S|Bed011
me045|i mean from my point of view i'm i'm trying to care about the syntax so you know|D|Bed011
me010|well that too.|S|Bed011
me010|but um you know if if we in if we you know make sure that we get them talking about temporal order.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|okay that would be great.|S|Bed011
me010|and if if they use prepositional phrases or subordinate clauses or whatever.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
me045|right okay.|B|Bed011
me010|um|F|Bed011
me010|you know whatever form they use is fine.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|S|Bed011
me010|but i i think that probably we're going to try to look at it as you know what semantic constructions do we do we want them to uh do|D|Bed011
me045|okay.|S|Bed011
me010|you know um caused motion.|S|Bed011
me010|i don't know.|S|Bed011
me010|something like that.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|B|Bed011
me010|uh but uh uh this is actually a conversation you and i have to have about your thesis fantasies and how all this fits into that.|S|Bed011
me045|got it.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
me045|uh yeah okay.|B|Bed011
me010|but uh|D|Bed011
mn015|well i will tell you the german tourist data.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|S|Bed011
mn015|because i have not been able to dig out all the stuff out of the thirty d v ds.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|B|Bed011
mn015|um if you|D|Bed011
me045|is that roughly the equivalent of of what i've seen in english or is it|D|Bed011
mn015|no not at all.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|S|Bed011
mn015|dialogues.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|S|Bed011
mn015|smartkom human.|S|Bed011
mn015|wizard of oz.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|B|Bed011
me045|same|D|Bed011
me045|okay that.|S|Bed011
me045|got it.|S|Bed011
me045|like what what have i got now?|Q|Bed011
me045|i mean i have uh what what i'm what i|D|Bed011
me045|those files that you sent me are the user side of some interaction with fey?|Q|Bed011
mn015|a little bit of data i|D|Bed011
me045|is that what it is or|D|Bed011
mn015|with nothing.|S|Bed011
me010|no no.|S|Bed011
me045|just talking into a box and not hearing anything back.|S|Bed011
mn015|yep.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|S|Bed011
mn015|yep.|S|Bed011
mn015|some data i collected in a couple weeks for training recognizers and email way back when.|S|Bed011
me045|okay okay.|S|Bed011
mn015|nothing to write home about.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|S|Bed011
mn015|and um the|D|Bed011
mn015|see this this this uh ontology node is probably something that i will try to expand.|S|Bed011
mn015|once we have the full ontology a p i what can we expect to get from the ontology?|Q|Bed011
mn015|and hopefully you can sort of also try to find out you know sooner or later in the course of the summer what we can expect to get from the discourse that might you know or the|D|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
me010|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
mn015|not the discourse the utterance as it were uh|D|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
me010|right.|S|Bed011
mn015|in terms of uh|D|Bed011
me010|right but we're not expecting keith to actually build a parser.|S|Bed011
mn015|no no no no no.|S|Bed011
me045|right right.|S|Bed011
me010|okay.|S|Bed011
me010|we are expecting johno to build a parser.|S|Bed011
mn015|yes.|S|Bed011
me010|but that's a|D|Bed011
me045|by the end of the summer too.|S|Bed011
me010|no.|S|Bed011
mn015|no.|S|Bed011
me010|no.|S|Bed011
me010|uh he's he's hoping to do this for his masters' thesis by a year from now.|S|Bed011
mn015|but it's sort of it's|D|Bed011
me045|right.|S|Bed011
me045|huh!|S|Bed011
me045|still pretty formidable actually.|S|Bed011
me010|uh absolutely.|S|Bed011
me010|uh limited.|S|Bed011
me010|i mean you know the idea is is|D|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|well the hope is that the parser itself is uh pretty robust.|S|Bed011
me010|but it's not popular it's only only|D|Bed011
me045|right right.|S|Bed011
me045|existence proof you know.|S|Bed011
me045|set up the infrastructure.|S|Bed011
me010|right.|S|Bed011
me010|it's only|D|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|right.|S|Bed011
me045|um sometime i have to talk to some subset of the people in this group at least about um what sort of constructions i'm looking for.|S|Bed011
me045|i mean you know obviously like just again looking at this one uh thing you know i saw things from sort of as general as argument structure constructions.|S|Bed011
me045|oh you know i have to do verb phrase.|S|Bed011
me045|i have to do uh uh unbounded dependencies.|S|Bed011
me045|you know which have a variety of constructions in uh uh|D|Bed011
me045|instantiate that.|S|Bed011
me045|on the other hand i have to have you know|D|Bed011
me045|there's particular uh fixed expressions or semi fixed expressions like get plus path expression for you know how how do i get there.|S|Bed011
me010|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
me045|how do i get in.|S|Bed011
me045|how do i get away.|S|Bed011
me010|right.|B|Bed011
me045|and all that kind of stuff.|S|Bed011
me045|um so there's a variety of sort of different sorts of constructions.|S|Bed011
me010|absolutely.|S|Bed011
me045|and it you know it's it's sort of like anything goes.|S|Bed011
me045|like|D|Bed011
me010|okay so this is i think we're going to mainly work on with george.|S|Bed011
me010|okay and|D|Bed011
me045|okay.|B|Bed011
me010|let me say what i think is is|D|Bed011
me010|so the idea is uh first of all i misspoke when i said we thought you should do the constructions.|S|Bed011
me010|cause apparently for a linguist that means to do completely and perfectly.|S|Bed011
me010|so what i yeah okay so what what i meant was do a first cut at.|S|Bed011
me045|uh that's what|D|Bed011
me045|yeah yeah.|S|Bed011
me010|okay because uh we do want to get them perfectly but i think we're going to have to do a first cut at a lot of them to see how they interact.|S|Bed011
me045|of course.|S|Bed011
me045|right exactly.|F|Bed011
me045|now it we talked about this before.|S|Bed011
me045|right?|Q|Bed011
me045|and i i it would it would be completely out of the question to really do more than say like oh i don't know ten over the summer.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|B|Bed011
me045|but uh but you know obviously we need to get sort of a general view of what things look like.|S|Bed011
me045|so|D|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|right.|S|Bed011
me010|so the idea is going to be to do|D|Bed011
me010|sort of like nancy did in some of uh these papers where you do enough of them so you can go from top to bottom.|S|Bed011
me010|so you can do you know uh have a complete story of of some piece of dialogue.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
me010|and that's going to be much more useful than having all of the clausal constructions and nothing else or or or something like that.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
me045|sure.|B|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|so that the the trick is going to be to take this and pick a some sort of lattice of constructions.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
me010|some lexical and some phrasal and and you know|D|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
me010|whatever you need in order to uh be able to then uh by hand you know explain some fraction of the utterances.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|and so exactly which ones will partly depend on your research interests and a bunch of other things.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
me045|sure.|S|Bed011
me045|okay.|B|Bed011
me045|but i mean in terms of the sort of level of uh of analysis.|S|Bed011
me045|you know these don't necessarily have to be more complex than like the out of construction in the b c p paper where it's just like you know half a page on each one or something.|S|Bed011
me010|correct.|S|Bed011
me010|oh yeah yeah.|D|Bed011
me010|a half a page is is what we'd like.|S|Bed011
me045|yeah.|B|Bed011
me010|and if if there's something that really requires a lot more than that then it does.|S|Bed011
me010|and we have to do it.|S|Bed011
me010|but|D|Bed011
me045|yeah.|F|Bed011
me045|for the first cut that should be fine yeah.|S|Bed011
me010|yeah.|S|Bed011
mn015|we could sit down and think of sort of the the ideal speaker utterances.|S|Bed011
mn015|and i mean two or three that follow each other.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
mn015|so where we can also sort of once we have everything up and running show the tremendous insane inferencing capabilities of our system.|S|Bed011
me045|uhhuh.|B|Bed011
mn015|so you know as as the smartkom people have.|S|Bed011
mn015|this is sort of their standard demo dialogue which is you know what the system survives and nothing but that.|S|Bed011
