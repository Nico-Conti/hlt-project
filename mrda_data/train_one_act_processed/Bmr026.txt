me011|okay we're on.|S|Bmr026
me011|so i think this is going to be a pretty short meeting because i have four agenda items.|S|Bmr026
me011|three of them were requested by jane who is not going to be at the meeting today.|S|Bmr026
me011|tsk.|B|Bmr026
me011|so the uh first was transcription status.|S|Bmr026
me011|does anyone besides jane know what the transcription status is?|Q|Bmr026
me018|um sort of i do peripherally.|S|Bmr026
me018|um well first of all with i b m i got a note from brian yesterday saying that they finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them a week or week and a half ago.|S|Bmr026
mn014|is that english?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|that's our system.|S|Bmr026
me011|ugh!|S|Bmr026
me018|and that it's gone out to the transcribers.|S|Bmr026
me018|and hopefully next week we'll have the transcription back from that.|S|Bmr026
me018|um jane seems to be um moving right along on the transcriptions from the icsi side.|S|Bmr026
me011|can i have a pen?|Q|Bmr026
me018|she's assigned i think probably five or six more meetings.|S|Bmr026
mn014|yeah i think we're up to m r thirteen or something.|S|Bmr026
me018|yeah so um i guess she's hired some new transcribers.|S|Bmr026
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr026
me018|and|D|Bmr026
me001|which meetings is she transcribing?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|speaking|D|Bmr026
me018|um well we've we've run out of e d us because a certain number of them are um sort of awaiting to go to i b m.|S|Bmr026
me001|okay.|S|Bmr026
mn014|for i b m yeah.|S|Bmr026
me001|okay.|B|Bmr026
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr026
me018|and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here.|S|Bmr026
me001|so we're doing some in parallel.|S|Bmr026
mn017|so does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there's no data back from i b m?|Q|Bmr026
me011|yep.|S|Bmr026
me018|no.|S|Bmr026
me018|oh no no.|S|Bmr026
me011|no no.|S|Bmr026
me018|no.|S|Bmr026
mn017|no?|Q|Bmr026
me018|we're not waiting on them.|S|Bmr026
me011|we haven't done that process.|S|Bmr026
me011|so they're doing the full transcription process.|S|Bmr026
mn017|oh.|S|Bmr026
mn017|oh okay.|S|Bmr026
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me001|so they're just doing their own thing until|D|Bmr026
mn017|because i i need to ask jane whether it's it would be okay for her um some of her people to transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the smartkom data collection which is these short like five or seven minute sessions.|S|Bmr026
me018|we're doing it in parallel yeah.|S|Bmr026
me001|okay.|S|Bmr026
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr026
mn017|um and we want it you know we need|D|Bmr026
mn017|the again we we have a similar uh logistic set up where we are supposed to send the data to munich.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and get it transcribed and get it back.|S|Bmr026
me011|right.|B|Bmr026
mn017|but to get going we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get started.|S|Bmr026
me011|yep sounds familiar.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and so um i wanted to ask jane if if uh you know maybe one of their transcribers could could do|D|Bmr026
mn017|i mean since these are very short that should really be uh|D|Bmr026
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|um it's|D|Bmr026
mn014|there's only two channels.|S|Bmr026
mn014|so it's only|D|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr026
mn017|it's only two|D|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|F|Bmr026
mn014|as the synthesis doesn't have to be transcribed i think.|S|Bmr026
mn017|right|F|Bmr026
mn014|so|F|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|F|Bmr026
mn017|so so it's basically one channel to transcribe.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and it's|D|Bmr026
mn017|one session is only uh like seven|D|Bmr026
me013|so that should have many fewer|D|Bmr026
me013|and it's also not uh a bunch of interruptions with people and all that.|S|Bmr026
mn017|right.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and some of it is read speech so we could give them the the thing that they're reading.|S|Bmr026
me013|right?|Q|Bmr026
me013|so|F|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|and they just may|D|Bmr026
me011|make sure it's right?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|and so um|F|Bmr026
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr026
mn017|um i guess since she's|D|Bmr026
mn017|i was going to ask her but since she's not around i maybe i'll|D|Bmr026
me013|yeah well it certainly seems|D|Bmr026
mn017|uh if if that's okay with you to to you know get that stuff uh to ask her for that then i'll do that.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah if we're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that that's okay because i i um i mean i still have high hopes that the that the i b m pipeline will work out for us so it's|D|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|okay yeah.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|alrighty.|S|Bmr026
me018|oh yeah and also related to the transcription stuff.|S|Bmr026
me018|so i've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date showing what the current status is of the of all the things we've collected.|S|Bmr026
me018|and what stage each meeting is in in terms of whether it's|D|Bmr026
me011|can you mail that out to the list?|Q|Bmr026
me018|uhhuh yeah i will.|S|Bmr026
me018|i|D|Bmr026
me018|that's the thing that i sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages.|S|Bmr026
me018|and so that's where i'm putting it but i'll|D|Bmr026
me011|oh okay okay.|S|Bmr026
me018|i'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it.|S|Bmr026
me011|yeah i haven't done that.|S|Bmr026
me011|so i have lots of stuff to add that's just in my own directory.|S|Bmr026
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me011|i'll try to get to that.|S|Bmr026
me011|okay.|S|Bmr026
me011|so jane also wanted to talk about participant approval but i don't really think there's much to talk about.|S|Bmr026
me011|i'm just going to do it.|S|Bmr026
me011|and uh if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead.|S|Bmr026
me013|you are going to|D|Bmr026
me011|i'm going to send out to the participants uh with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to suggest edits.|S|Bmr026
me011|and then bleep them out.|S|Bmr026
me013|okay.|S|Bmr026
me011|for the ones that we have.|S|Bmr026
me011|um|F|Bmr026
mn014|so but it's just transcripts not the not the audio?|Q|Bmr026
me011|nope they'll have access to the audio also.|S|Bmr026
mn014|okay yeah yep.|S|Bmr026
mn014|uh|F|Bmr026
me011|i mean that's my intention.|S|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me011|because the transcripts might not be right.|S|Bmr026
me018|so|F|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me011|so you want people to be able to listen to them.|S|Bmr026
me018|so um the audio that they're going to have access to will that be the uncompressed version?|Q|Bmr026
me018|or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and|D|Bmr026
me011|oh that's a good point.|S|Bmr026
me011|that's a good point.|S|Bmr026
me011|yeah it's it's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because uh uh it takes too long to do random access decompression.|S|Bmr026
me018|huh.|B|Bmr026
me018|yeah i was just wondering because we're uh running out of the un backed up disk space on|D|Bmr026
me011|well that was the other point.|S|Bmr026
me018|oh was that another one?|Q|Bmr026
me011|yep that's another agenda item.|S|Bmr026
me018|okay.|S|Bmr026
me018|i'll wait.|S|Bmr026
me011|so uh|F|Bmr026
me011|but that is a good point so we'll get to that too.|S|Bmr026
me011|um darpa demo status not much to say.|S|Bmr026
me011|the back end stuff is working out fine.|S|Bmr026
me011|it's more or less ready to go.|S|Bmr026
me011|i've added some stuff that uh indexes by the meeting type m r e d u et cetera.|S|Bmr026
me011|and also by the user i d.|S|Bmr026
me011|so that the front end can then do filtering based on that as well.|S|Bmr026
me011|uh the back end is uh going more slowly as i i think i said before just because i'm not much of a tcl t.k. programmer.|S|Bmr026
me011|and uh dave gelbart says he's a little too busy.|S|Bmr026
me011|so i think don and i are going to work on that and and you and i can just talk about it off line more.|S|Bmr026
me001|right.|B|Bmr026
me011|but uh the back end was pretty smooth.|S|Bmr026
me013|oh.|F|Bmr026
me011|so i think we'll have something.|S|Bmr026
me011|it may not be as as pretty as we might like but we'll have something.|S|Bmr026
me013|i wondered when we would reach dave's saturation point.|S|Bmr026
me013|he's sort of been been volunteering for everything.|S|Bmr026
me013|and and uh|D|Bmr026
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me013|okay!|S|Bmr026
me013|finally said he was too busy.|S|Bmr026
me013|i guess we reached it.|S|Bmr026
me011|yeah he he actually he volunteered but then he then he retracted it.|S|Bmr026
me011|so|F|Bmr026
me011|oh well.|S|Bmr026
me011|um|F|Bmr026
me001|and also um i was just showing andreas i got um an x waves kind of display.|S|Bmr026
me001|and i don't know how much more we can do with it.|S|Bmr026
me001|with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom.|S|Bmr026
me011|oh cool.|S|Bmr026
me001|so right now it's just an x waves.|S|Bmr026
me001|and then you have three windows.|S|Bmr026
me001|but i don't know it looked pretty nice.|S|Bmr026
me001|and i'm sure it think it has potential for a little something.|S|Bmr026
me011|for a demo?|Q|Bmr026
me001|yeah for a demo.|S|Bmr026
me011|yeah sounds good.|S|Bmr026
me001|so|F|Bmr026
me013|okay so again the issue is for july the issue's going to be what can we fit into a windows machine uh and so on.|S|Bmr026
me001|oh.|B|Bmr026
me013|but|F|Bmr026
me001|okay.|S|Bmr026
me011|so it might just be slides.|S|Bmr026
me001|yeah okay.|S|Bmr026
me001|well we'll see um|D|Bmr026
mn014|well yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn014|i've been putting together uh transcriber things for windows.|S|Bmr026
mn014|so|D|Bmr026
mn014|and i installed it on dave gelbart's p c and it worked just fine.|S|Bmr026
mn014|so hopefully that will work.|S|Bmr026
mn017|really?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|so is that|D|Bmr026
mn017|because there's some people um|D|Bmr026
mn017|it would be cool if we could uh get that to work uh at at s r i.|S|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|because the um|D|Bmr026
mn014|yep.|S|Bmr026
mn017|we have we have more windows machines to run the|D|Bmr026
me011|well transcriber is tcl t.k. very generic with snack.|S|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me011|so basically anything you can get snack to run on it will work.|S|Bmr026
mn017|right.|B|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|F|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|F|Bmr026
mn014|but but the problem is the version transcriber works with the snack version is one point six whatever.|S|Bmr026
mn014|and that's not anymore supported.|S|Bmr026
mn014|it's not on on the web page anymore.|S|Bmr026
mn014|but i just wrote an email to to the author of to the snack author.|S|Bmr026
mn014|and he sent me to one point six whatever library.|S|Bmr026
mn014|and so it works.|S|Bmr026
me011|well i thought it was packaged with transcriber.|S|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr026
mn014|but then you can't add our patches.|S|Bmr026
mn014|and then the the new version is is totally different.|S|Bmr026
me011|oh.|S|Bmr026
mn014|and in yeah in terms of of the source code.|S|Bmr026
mn014|you you can't find the tcl files anymore.|S|Bmr026
me011|uh.|B|Bmr026
mn014|it's some whatever wrapped thing.|S|Bmr026
mn017|huh.|D|Bmr026
mn014|and you can't you can't access that.|S|Bmr026
mn014|so you have to install first install tcl then install snack.|S|Bmr026
mn014|and then install the transcriber thing.|S|Bmr026
mn014|and then do the patches.|S|Bmr026
me011|patch.|S|Bmr026
mn017|i i wonder if if we should contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along|D|Bmr026
me011|ugh!|S|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me011|we have.|S|Bmr026
mn017|we have?|Q|Bmr026
me011|yeah it's just hasn't made it into the release yet.|S|Bmr026
mn017|oh.|S|Bmr026
mn017|oh okay.|S|Bmr026
me018|so did you um put the uh the n t version out on the uh meeting recorder page or|D|Bmr026
mn014|no i haven't done that yet.|S|Bmr026
mn014|i'm|D|Bmr026
mn014|oh nope.|S|Bmr026
mn014|but i definitely will do that.|S|Bmr026
me013|so can some of the stuff that don's talking about somehow fit into this?|Q|Bmr026
me013|uh mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the|D|Bmr026
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me001|yeah it's basically ascii files or binary files whatever representation.|S|Bmr026
mn014|so|F|Bmr026
me001|just three different|D|Bmr026
me001|it's a waveform and just a stylized pitch vector basically so it's|D|Bmr026
me001|i mean we could do it in i mean you could do it in a number of different places i'm sure.|S|Bmr026
mn017|so so well|F|Bmr026
mn017|but but it would be cool if the transcriber interface had like another window for the you know maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is that is you know time time synchronous with the waveform.|S|Bmr026
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr026
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me001|yeah that'd be very cool.|S|Bmr026
me013|yes.|B|Bmr026
me011|it'd be easy enough to add that.|S|Bmr026
me011|again it's it's it's more tcl t.k. programming.|S|Bmr026
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me011|so someone who's familiar with tcl t.k. has to do it.|S|Bmr026
mn017|right.|B|Bmr026
mn017|right.|B|Bmr026
me011|but uh it wouldn't be hard to do.|S|Bmr026
mn017|but it would almost be like having another waveform displayed.|S|Bmr026
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me011|yep.|S|Bmr026
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr026
mn017|right.|B|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn014|yeah maybe we could look into that.|S|Bmr026
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me011|but it it seems to me that i|D|Bmr026
mn014|and|D|Bmr026
me011|it doesn't seem like having that real time is that necessary.|S|Bmr026
me011|so it seems to me you could do images.|S|Bmr026
me001|um what do you mean by real time?|Q|Bmr026
me001|do you mean like|D|Bmr026
me018|like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo.|S|Bmr026
me001|okay.|S|Bmr026
me018|is that what you mean?|Q|Bmr026
me011|yeah yeah.|S|Bmr026
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me011|it just seems to me|D|Bmr026
me001|it would be cool to see it.|D|Bmr026
me001|it would be cool like to see to hear it and see it.|S|Bmr026
mn014|and to hear it.|S|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me001|and see the pitch contours also.|S|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me011|sure but i don't think i you can do all that just statically in powerpoint.|S|Bmr026
me001|i think it would lose|D|Bmr026
me001|yeah i mean|D|Bmr026
me011|just record the audio clip and show an image and i think that's|D|Bmr026
me001|right right.|F|Bmr026
me001|i just thought if you meant slides i thought you meant like just like um view graphs or something.|S|Bmr026
me013|you know|D|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr026
me013|so uh|D|Bmr026
me013|no we're talking about on the computer.|S|Bmr026
me001|right.|B|Bmr026
me013|and and um i think when we were talking about this before we had this little demo meeting.|S|Bmr026
me013|we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have.|S|Bmr026
me013|and the more live the better but uh given the crunch of time we may have to retreat from it to some extent.|S|Bmr026
me013|so i think for a lot of reasons i think it would be very nice to have this transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me013|so it'd be a good thing to get in there.|S|Bmr026
me013|but|F|Bmr026
me013|um anyway just looking for ways that we could actually show what you're doing uh in to people.|S|Bmr026
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me013|because a lot of this stuff particularly for communicator uh certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about originally had had to do with prosodics.|S|Bmr026
me013|it'd be nice to show that we can actually get them and see them.|S|Bmr026
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr026
me011|and the last item on the agenda is disk issues yet again.|S|Bmr026
me011|so we're doing okay on backed up.|S|Bmr026
me011|we're we're only about thirty per cent on the second disk.|S|Bmr026
me011|so uh we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical.|S|Bmr026
me011|but we are like ninety five per cent ninety eight per cent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings.|S|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me011|and my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space.|S|Bmr026
me011|but unfortunately we're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data all at once in a lot of different ways.|S|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me018|oh there's a lot of transcribers too.|S|Bmr026
me011|yeah there're a lot of transcribers.|S|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me011|so all of those need to be expanded.|S|Bmr026
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me011|and then people are doing chunking and i want to do uh uh uh the permission forms.|S|Bmr026
me018|right.|B|Bmr026
me011|so i want those to be live so there's a lot of data that has to be around.|S|Bmr026
me011|um and jane was going to talk to uh dave johnson about it.|S|Bmr026
me011|one of the things i was thinking is we we just got these hundred|D|Bmr026
me011|all right excuse me.|S|Bmr026
me011|ten uh sparc blade sun blades.|S|Bmr026
me013|did they come in?|Q|Bmr026
me018|sun blades.|S|Bmr026
me018|yeah.|S|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me018|they came in the other day.|S|Bmr026
me011|they came in but they're not set up yet.|S|Bmr026
me013|oh.|S|Bmr026
me011|and so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those because they'll be in the machine room.|S|Bmr026
me011|they'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines.|S|Bmr026
me011|and if we just need un backed up space we could just hang disks off them.|S|Bmr026
me018|well is there|D|Bmr026
me018|why not just hang them off of abbott?|Q|Bmr026
me018|is there a|D|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me011|because there's no more room in the disk racks on abbott.|S|Bmr026
me018|uh.|S|Bmr026
me018|uh i see.|S|Bmr026
me013|weren't we going to get|D|Bmr026
me013|well maybe it should get another rack.|S|Bmr026
mn017|but you still need to store the disks somehow.|S|Bmr026
me011|well but the sun blades have spare drive bays.|S|Bmr026
mn017|so|D|Bmr026
me018|you can put two|D|Bmr026
me011|just put them in.|S|Bmr026
mn017|oh you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the|D|Bmr026
mn014|internal.|S|Bmr026
me011|sure.|B|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|D|Bmr026
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr026
mn017|oh.|S|Bmr026
me011|because the sun uh these sun blades take commodity hard drives.|S|Bmr026
me011|so you can just go out and buy a p c hard drive and stick it in.|S|Bmr026
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr026
me013|but if abbott is going to be our disk server it it file server it seems like we would want to get it uh a second disk rack or something.|S|Bmr026
mn017|plus we're talking about buying a second uh file server.|S|Bmr026
me011|well i mean there are lots of long term solutions.|S|Bmr026
me011|what i'm looking for is where do we expand the next meeting?|Q|Bmr026
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr026
mn017|i see oh i see.|S|Bmr026
me013|well for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten.|S|Bmr026
me013|mightn't you?|Q|Bmr026
me013|uh you know dave johnson is gone for like ten days.|S|Bmr026
me011|oh i didn't know he had left already.|S|Bmr026
me013|uh well tonight.|S|Bmr026
me011|oh oh well.|S|Bmr026
mn017|you mean he won't set up the|D|Bmr026
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr026
me001|how much space do you need for these?|Q|Bmr026
me013|i don't know.|S|Bmr026
me013|i don't know what his schedule is.|S|Bmr026
me011|you we need about a gig per meeting.|S|Bmr026
me013|i'm just saying he's gone.|S|Bmr026
me018|i i|D|Bmr026
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr026
me001|i have um i have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer.|S|Bmr026
me011|all right!|S|Bmr026
me001|so|F|Bmr026
me011|what's your computer's name?|Q|Bmr026
me001|uh samosa.|S|Bmr026
me013|you had an eighteen gigabyte drive.|S|Bmr026
me001|yeah i had.|S|Bmr026
me001|well it's about i think there's about twelve gig left.|S|Bmr026
me011|so it and you have an x drives installed?|Q|Bmr026
me001|yeah.|S|Bmr026
me011|okay.|S|Bmr026
me001|so i didn't realize it was so critical.|S|Bmr026
me011|and you're you're offering|D|Bmr026
me001|i mean i'm not doing anything on it right now until i get new meetings to or that are new transcriptions coming in i really can't do anything.|S|Bmr026
me011|okay.|S|Bmr026
me018|i i i just gave thilo some about ten gigs the last ten gigs of space that there was on on uh abbott.|S|Bmr026
me001|um not that i can't do anything i|D|Bmr026
me018|uh and uh|F|Bmr026
me018|so but that but|D|Bmr026
me011|which one was that?|Q|Bmr026
me011|x g?|Q|Bmr026
mn014|x g.|S|Bmr026
me018|x g.|S|Bmr026
me011|okay.|S|Bmr026
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|x g?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|that's also where we store the the uh hub five training set waveforms.|S|Bmr026
mn014|oops.|S|Bmr026
me018|no.|S|Bmr026
mn017|right?|Q|Bmr026
me011|but that won't be getting any bigger.|S|Bmr026
me018|i don't think that's on x g.|S|Bmr026
me011|will it?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|right.|S|Bmr026
me018|on x g is only carmen and and stephane's disk.|S|Bmr026
mn014|it's|D|Bmr026
mn017|but i've also been storing i've been storing the feature files there.|S|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|and i guess i can start deleting some because we now know what the best features are.|S|Bmr026
me001|well|F|Bmr026
mn017|and we won't be using the old ones anymore.|S|Bmr026
me018|yeah i i don't think it was on x g.|S|Bmr026
me001|i have a lot of space though.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uh oh thats x.a. oh that's x|D|Bmr026
mn014|isn't that x h?|Q|Bmr026
me018|i|D|Bmr026
me001|i have a lot of space and it's not it's|D|Bmr026
me011|not not for long.|S|Bmr026
me001|there's very little uh|D|Bmr026
me001|yeah.|S|Bmr026
me001|not for long.|S|Bmr026
me001|but i mean it's not going|D|Bmr026
mn017|maybe i'm|D|Bmr026
mn017|oh no i'm sorry.|S|Bmr026
me001|it's not being used often at all.|S|Bmr026
mn014|but i'm using x h h too.|S|Bmr026
me011|yeah it's probably probably only about four gig is on x on your x drive.|S|Bmr026
mn014|so|D|Bmr026
mn017|oh okay.|S|Bmr026
me011|but we'll definitely take it up if you|D|Bmr026
me001|i|D|Bmr026
mn017|i think you're right.|S|Bmr026
me001|i think it's about four or five gig.|S|Bmr026
mn017|it's x h and d|D|Bmr026
me001|because i have four meetings on there.|S|Bmr026
mn017|the|D|Bmr026
mn017|i'm also using d g.|S|Bmr026
mn017|i got that confused.|S|Bmr026
me001|three or four meetings.|S|Bmr026
mn017|okay k.|S|Bmr026
me011|great.|S|Bmr026
me001|so|D|Bmr026
me013|we need|D|Bmr026
me011|okay so that will get us through the next couple days.|S|Bmr026
me013|we need another gigaquad.|S|Bmr026
me011|yep.|S|Bmr026
me011|at least.|S|Bmr026
me013|there should i there should just be a i should have a button.|S|Bmr026
me013|just press press each meeting saying we need more disk space this week.|S|Bmr026
me011|the more disk space button?|Q|Bmr026
me011|yep.|B|Bmr026
me013|skip the rest of the conversation.|S|Bmr026
me018|well we've collected so far something like uh sixty five meetings.|S|Bmr026
me018|and it's about a gig uncompressed.|S|Bmr026
me013|and and how much does each meeting take?|Q|Bmr026
mn014|it's it's a little bit more as i usually don't do not uncompress the all of the p z m and the p d a things.|S|Bmr026
me018|is a little more?|Q|Bmr026
me018|right yeah so if you uncompressed everything it's even more.|S|Bmr026
mn014|so|D|Bmr026
mn014|it's|D|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn014|one point five or something.|S|Bmr026
me018|uh compressed how much are they?|Q|Bmr026
me018|like|D|Bmr026
me011|half a gig.|S|Bmr026
me018|about half?|Q|Bmr026
me011|for all of them.|S|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr026
me018|so we're definitely are storing you know all of those.|S|Bmr026
me018|so there's what?|Q|Bmr026
me018|thirty some gig of just meetings so far?|Q|Bmr026
me013|so so so maybe there's a hundred gig or something.|S|Bmr026
me013|or|D|Bmr026
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me013|i mean because we we have the uncompressed around also.|S|Bmr026
me018|right.|B|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me013|so it's like|D|Bmr026
me018|right.|B|Bmr026
me018|well we we haven't uncompressed all the meetings.|S|Bmr026
me018|but|F|Bmr026
me011|i would like to.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me013|well i mean it's they really are cheap.|S|Bmr026
me013|i mean it's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them.|S|Bmr026
me018|right.|B|Bmr026
me011|yep.|B|Bmr026
me013|but but uh we could you know if you want to get four disks get four disks.|S|Bmr026
me013|i mean it's it's small i mean these things are just a few hundred dollars.|S|Bmr026
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me018|well i sent that message out to i guess you and dave asking for if we could get some disk.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me018|i i sent this out a a day ago.|S|Bmr026
me011|and put it where?|Q|Bmr026
me013|right.|B|Bmr026
me018|but and dave didn't respond so i i don't know how the whole process works.|S|Bmr026
me018|i mean does he just go out and get them and if it's okay and|D|Bmr026
me011|yep.|B|Bmr026
me018|so i was assuming he was going to take over that.|S|Bmr026
me018|but he's probably too busy given that he's leaving.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah i think you need a direct conversation with him.|S|Bmr026
me013|and just say an just ask him that you know what should you do.|S|Bmr026
me013|and in my answer back was are you sure you just want one.|S|Bmr026
me013|so i mean i think that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure well here's what we figure on doing for the next few months.|S|Bmr026
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me011|i know what they want.|S|Bmr026
me011|the sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me011|so they don't want to stack up external drives.|S|Bmr026
me011|um and then they want everything else in the machine room.|S|Bmr026
me013|right.|B|Bmr026
me011|so the question is where are you going to hang them?|Q|Bmr026
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me018|i don't know what the space situation is in the machine room.|S|Bmr026
me011|right.|B|Bmr026
me018|so|D|Bmr026
me013|right.|B|Bmr026
me013|so this is a question that's pretty hard to solve without talking to dave.|S|Bmr026
mn017|the|D|Bmr026
me018|i think part of the reason why dave can't get the the new machines up is because he doesn't have room in the machine room right now.|S|Bmr026
me013|because it|D|Bmr026
mn017|one|D|Bmr026
mn017|huh.|D|Bmr026
me011|yep.|B|Bmr026
mn017|one one one thing to to um to do when you need to conserve space is|D|Bmr026
me018|so he has to re arrange a bunch of stuff.|S|Bmr026
mn017|i bet there are still some old uh like nine gig disks uh around.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and and you know recover the space.|S|Bmr026
me011|yep.|B|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me013|no.|F|Bmr026
me013|i think dave dave knows all these things of course.|S|Bmr026
mn017|right.|B|Bmr026
me013|and so he always has a lot of plans of things that he's going to do to make things better in many ways and runs out of time.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me011|but i i know that generally their first priority has been for backed up disk.|S|Bmr026
me011|and so i think what he's been concentrating on is uh the back the back up system rather than on new disk.|S|Bmr026
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr026
me011|so|F|Bmr026
me013|well.|F|Bmr026
me013|so|D|Bmr026
me011|which|D|Bmr026
me013|but this this is a very specific question for me.|S|Bmr026
me013|basically we can easily get one to four disks.|S|Bmr026
me013|i mean you just go out and get four and we've got the money for it.|S|Bmr026
me013|it's no big deal.|S|Bmr026
me013|uh but the question is where they go?|Q|Bmr026
me013|and i don't think we can solve that here.|S|Bmr026
mn017|maybe we can put some disks in the in that back room there.|S|Bmr026
me013|you just have to ask him.|S|Bmr026
me011|yeah really.|S|Bmr026
me013|attach to|D|Bmr026
me011|popcorn.|S|Bmr026
mn017|to the machine that collects the data.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|so then you could at least temporarily store stuff there.|S|Bmr026
mn017|the only|D|Bmr026
me018|huh.|D|Bmr026
me011|yeah it's just it's not on the net so it's a little awkward.|S|Bmr026
mn017|what do you mean it's not on the net?|Q|Bmr026
me011|it's not|D|Bmr026
mn014|it's not bad.|S|Bmr026
me011|it's behind lots of fire walls that don't allow any services through except s s h.|S|Bmr026
mn017|oh because it's because it's an aciri machine?|Q|Bmr026
me011|yep.|S|Bmr026
mn017|oh oh oh.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me011|and also on the list is to get it into the normal icsi net.|S|Bmr026
me011|but who knows when that will happen?|Q|Bmr026
me018|that might be a good short term solution though.|S|Bmr026
mn017|but that can't be that hard.|S|Bmr026
mn017|i mean|F|Bmr026
me011|no the the problem with that apparently is that they don't currently have a wire running to that back room that goes anywhere near one of the icsi routers.|S|Bmr026
mn017|oh|D|Bmr026
me011|so they actually have to run a wire somewhere.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr026
me013|yeah again you know any one of these things is certainly not a big deal.|S|Bmr026
me013|if there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it's it's everybody everybody has a has|D|Bmr026
me011|but dave has to do all of them.|S|Bmr026
me013|well all of us have long lists of different things we're doing.|S|Bmr026
me013|but at any rate i think that there's a there's a longer term thing and there's immediate need.|S|Bmr026
me013|and i think we need a a conversation with|D|Bmr026
me013|uh maybe maybe after after tea or something you and i can go down and and talk to him about it.|D|Bmr026
me013|just say you know what should we do right now.|S|Bmr026
me018|how long is david going to be gone?|Q|Bmr026
me013|uh eleven days or something.|S|Bmr026
me011|oh my!|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me013|basically tomorrow and all of the week after.|S|Bmr026
me011|and that's all i have.|S|Bmr026
me013|um|F|Bmr026
me013|let's see.|F|Bmr026
me013|the only thing other thing i was going to add was that um uh i talked briefly to mari.|S|Bmr026
me013|and uh we had both been busy with other things so we haven't really connected that much since the last meeting we had here.|S|Bmr026
me013|but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting the friday after next.|S|Bmr026
me013|and i i i wanted to make it um after the next one of these meetings.|S|Bmr026
me013|so something that we want to do next meeting is is uh to put together um a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it um that we've done.|S|Bmr026
me013|i mean just sort of bulletize i mean i can i can dream up text but this is basically going to lead to the annual report.|S|Bmr026
me013|so um if|D|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|D|Bmr026
me011|this is the fifteenth?|Q|Bmr026
me013|um that would|D|Bmr026
me011|so just a week from tomorrow?|Q|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr026
me011|okay.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr026
me013|so uh we can|D|Bmr026
me013|this|D|Bmr026
mn017|is this got to be in the morning?|Q|Bmr026
me013|so that's an|D|Bmr026
me013|um|F|Bmr026
mn017|or|D|Bmr026
mn017|because you know i fridays i have to leave uh like around uh two.|S|Bmr026
mn017|so if it could be before that would be be|D|Bmr026
me013|no no but i i i don't need other folks for the meeting.|S|Bmr026
me013|i can do it.|S|Bmr026
mn017|oh okay all right.|S|Bmr026
me013|all i'm saying is that on|D|Bmr026
mn017|oh i'm sorry i misunderstood.|S|Bmr026
mn017|i thought you are|D|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr026
me013|so what i meant was on the this meeting if i something i i i'm making a major thing in the agenda is i want to help in getting together a list of what it is that we've done so i can tell her.|S|Bmr026
mn017|okay.|B|Bmr026
mn017|all right.|B|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|okay.|B|Bmr026
me013|i think i have a pretty good idea.|S|Bmr026
me013|but but um|F|Bmr026
me013|uh and then the next day uh late in the day i'll be having that that discussion with her.|S|Bmr026
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr026
me013|um so|F|Bmr026
mn017|um uh one thing i mean we in past meetings we had um also you know various variously talked about the um work that uh was happening sort of on the on the recognition side.|S|Bmr026
mn017|um but isn't necessarily related to meetings uh specifically.|S|Bmr026
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|so um and i wondered whether we should maybe have um a separate meeting.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and between you know whoever's interested in that.|S|Bmr026
mn017|because i feel that uh there's plenty of stuff to talk about.|S|Bmr026
mn017|but it would be sort of um maybe the wrong place to do it in this meeting if uh|D|Bmr026
me013|think so?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|well it's that it's just going to be very boring for people who are not you know sort of really interested in the details of the recognition system.|S|Bmr026
me011|i'm interested.|S|Bmr026
mn014|me too.|S|Bmr026
me013|well okay so how many how many people here would not be interested in uh in a meeting about recognition?|Q|Bmr026
me018|jane may not be.|S|Bmr026
me011|jane i think.|S|Bmr026
mn017|well i know well jane|D|Bmr026
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr026
mn017|well you mean in a separate meeting or talking about it in this|D|Bmr026
me011|no.|S|Bmr026
me011|if we talked about it in this meeting.|S|Bmr026
me018|he's wondering how much overlap there will be.|S|Bmr026
mn017|okay.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah so you're|D|Bmr026
me013|so|D|Bmr026
mn017|so|F|Bmr026
mn017|uh uh|F|Bmr026
mn017|liz and jane probably.|S|Bmr026
me013|okay so we're going to have a guy's meeting.|S|Bmr026
me018|good thing liz isn't here.|S|Bmr026
me013|real|D|Bmr026
mn017|uh if you want to put it that way.|S|Bmr026
me001|watch a ball game?|Q|Bmr026
me013|yeah real real real men real men do decoding or something like that.|S|Bmr026
me018|don't listen to this liz.|S|Bmr026
mn017|right.|B|Bmr026
me013|uh|D|Bmr026
mn017|i mean it's sort of i mean when when the talk is about data collection stuff sometimes i've you know i i'm bored.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me011|the nod off?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|so it's i i can sympathize with them not wanting to to to be uh you know if i you know this could|D|Bmr026
me013|it's because you have a|D|Bmr026
me013|so you need a better developed feminine side.|S|Bmr026
mn017|heh!|B|Bmr026
mn017|i'm not sure i want to|D|Bmr026
me013|there's probably going to be a lot of bleeps in this meeting.|S|Bmr026
me011|yeah i would i would guess.|S|Bmr026
me013|uh um|F|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|and|D|Bmr026
me013|i think it must be uh nearing the end of the week.|S|Bmr026
me013|um yeah.|S|Bmr026
me013|i you know i i've heard some comments about like this.|S|Bmr026
me013|that could be.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|D|Bmr026
me013|i mean the|D|Bmr026
me013|um|D|Bmr026
mn017|and we don't have to do it every week.|S|Bmr026
me018|could we|D|Bmr026
mn017|we could do it every other week or so.|S|Bmr026
me018|right i was|D|Bmr026
mn017|you know or whenever we feel like we|D|Bmr026
me018|why don't we alternate this meeting every other week?|Q|Bmr026
me011|or just alternate the focus.|S|Bmr026
me018|that's what i mean.|S|Bmr026
me011|yeah so on even weeks have basic on data.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr026
mn017|we could do that yeah.|S|Bmr026
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|i i personally i'd i'm not in favor of more meetings.|S|Bmr026
mn017|um because uh|D|Bmr026
me013|right.|B|Bmr026
mn017|you know|D|Bmr026
me011|i am.|S|Bmr026
me011|oh|D|Bmr026
me018|but i i don't i mean a lot of times lately it seems like we don't really have enough for a full meeting on meeting recorder.|S|Bmr026
mn017|right.|B|Bmr026
me018|so if we did that|D|Bmr026
me011|well except that we keep going for our full time.|S|Bmr026
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr026
me018|well because we get into these other topics.|S|Bmr026
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|we feel we feel obligated to collect more data.|S|Bmr026
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me018|so if we could alternate the focus of the meeting|D|Bmr026
me011|i don't.|S|Bmr026
me011|let's read digits and go.|S|Bmr026
me013|why don't we just start with that?|Q|Bmr026
me013|and then if we find you know we're just not getting enough done there's all these topics not coming up then we can expand into another meeting.|S|Bmr026
mn017|umm okay.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me013|but i i think that's a great idea.|S|Bmr026
me013|uh so uh um let's chat about it with liz and jane when we get a chance see what they think and|D|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|D|Bmr026
me018|yeah that would be good.|S|Bmr026
me018|i mean andreas and i have various talks in the halls.|S|Bmr026
me018|and there's lots of things you know details and stuff that would i think people would be interested in.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me018|and i'd you know where do we go from here kind of things and|D|Bmr026
me018|so it would be good.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah and you're you're attending the uh the front end meeting as well as the others so you have you have probably one of the best|D|Bmr026
me013|you and i i guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two.|S|Bmr026
me011|bridge.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me013|we are doing recognition in both of them.|S|Bmr026
me013|so|F|Bmr026
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|right.|B|Bmr026
me013|uh|F|Bmr026
mn017|so um|F|Bmr026
me011|okay.|B|Bmr026
mn017|so so we could talk a little bit about that now if if there's some time.|S|Bmr026
me011|no no that would be for next week.|S|Bmr026
mn017|um i so the latest result was that um|D|Bmr026
mn017|um yot i tested the uh the sort of final version of the p l p configuration um on development test data for for this year's hub five test set.|S|Bmr026
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|and the recognition performance was exactly and i mean exactly up to the you know the first decimal same as with the uh mel cepstra front end.|S|Bmr026
me011|huh.|D|Bmr026
me018|for both females and males?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|yes.|S|Bmr026
me018|oh!|S|Bmr026
mn017|uh well there was a little bit of a|D|Bmr026
mn017|overall.|S|Bmr026
mn017|they they were the males i think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really.|S|Bmr026
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|i mean definitely not significant.|S|Bmr026
me013|uhhuh.|D|Bmr026
me018|uhhuh.|D|Bmr026
mn017|and then the really nice thing was that if if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half per cent improvement.|S|Bmr026
me011|wow.|B|Bmr026
mn017|so|D|Bmr026
me011|just with rover?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|with n best rover which is like our new and improved version of rover.|S|Bmr026
me011|uhhuh.|S|Bmr026
mn017|which actually uses the whole n best list from both systems to uh combine that.|S|Bmr026
me013|so except i mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the auto regressive versus the cepstral truncation.|S|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me013|okay.|B|Bmr026
mn017|and the|D|Bmr026
me018|but a per cent and a half.|S|Bmr026
me018|that's|D|Bmr026
me011|yeah it's pretty impressive.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and and so uh after i told the my uh colleagues at s r i about that you know now they definitely want to you know uh have a|D|Bmr026
mn017|next time we have an evaluation they want to do uh you know basically at least the system combination.|S|Bmr026
mn017|um and you know why not?|Q|Bmr026
me013|sure why not?|S|Bmr026
mn017|uh so|F|Bmr026
me011|we clearly got to add a few more features though.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uh what do you mean?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|more features in the sense of front end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles?|Q|Bmr026
me011|no uh front end features.|S|Bmr026
me011|you know we did p l p and mel cepstra.|S|Bmr026
me011|let's you know try rasta and m s g and|D|Bmr026
mn017|oh i mean|D|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|well|F|Bmr026
mn017|right.|B|Bmr026
mn017|so we|D|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|that's the the the|D|Bmr026
mn017|there's one thing uh i mean you don't want to overdo it because every front end|D|Bmr026
mn017|you know if you you know you basically multiply your effort by n where n is a number of different systems.|S|Bmr026
me018|oh.|D|Bmr026
me013|uhhuh.|D|Bmr026
mn017|and um|F|Bmr026
mn017|so so one one compromise would be to only to have the everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and then after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and combine the results and that's a fairly painless um thing.|S|Bmr026
me013|huh.|B|Bmr026
me018|do you think we'd still get the one and a half uh|D|Bmr026
mn017|so|F|Bmr026
mn017|i i think so.|S|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|S|Bmr026
mn017|maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and so if|D|Bmr026
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|you know maybe it's only one per cent or something but that would still be worthwhile doing.|S|Bmr026
mn017|so|F|Bmr026
mn017|um you know just wanted to let you know that that's working out very nicely.|S|Bmr026
me011|cool.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and then we had some results on digits uh with um|D|Bmr026
mn017|we we|D|Bmr026
mn017|so this was uh really really sort of just to get dave going with his um experiments.|S|Bmr026
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|and so uh|D|Bmr026
mn017|but as a result um you know we were sort of wondering why is the hub five system doing so well on the digits.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and the reason is basically there's a whole bunch of read speech data in the hub five training set.|S|Bmr026
me013|right.|B|Bmr026
me011|right.|B|Bmr026
me013|including digits i gather yeah.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and you|D|Bmr026
mn017|and|D|Bmr026
mn017|not all of|D|Bmr026
mn017|no it's actually digits is only a maybe a fifth of it.|S|Bmr026
mn017|the rest is is read is read timit data and uh atis data and wall street journal and stuff like that.|S|Bmr026
me013|a fifth of it is how much?|Q|Bmr026
me013|right.|F|Bmr026
me013|but a a fifth is how much?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|a fifth would be maybe uh two hours something.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah so i mean that's actually not that different from the amount of training that there was.|S|Bmr026
mn017|right.|B|Bmr026
mn017|but it definitely helps to have the other read data in there.|S|Bmr026
me013|so|F|Bmr026
mn017|because we're doing|D|Bmr026
me013|oh yeah?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|you know the error rate is half of what you do if you train only on uh timit uh not timit uh t i digits.|S|Bmr026
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|which is only what?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|two hours something?|Q|Bmr026
me013|right.|B|Bmr026
me011|i don't know.|S|Bmr026
mn017|so uh more read speech data definitely helps.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and you can leave out all the conversational data with no performance penalty.|S|Bmr026
mn017|that's|D|Bmr026
me013|yeah that was the interesting thing.|S|Bmr026
mn017|that was|D|Bmr026
me013|because because uh it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data it would be better.|S|Bmr026
mn017|right right.|B|Bmr026
me013|but but uh|F|Bmr026
mn017|right.|B|Bmr026
me018|well is there even more read speech data around?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|oh yeah.|S|Bmr026
mn017|so we only for the hub five training we're only using uh a fairly small subset of the macrophone data base.|S|Bmr026
me018|uhhuh.|S|Bmr026
mn017|um so you could beef that up and probably do even better.|S|Bmr026
me011|i could also put in uh focus condition zero from hub four from broadcast news which is mostly prepared speech.|S|Bmr026
me018|uhhuh.|D|Bmr026
me011|it's not exactly read speech but it's pretty darn close.|S|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|right.|B|Bmr026
mn017|well i mean that's plenty of read speech data.|S|Bmr026
mn017|i mean wall street journal uh take one example.|S|Bmr026
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me011|that's right.|B|Bmr026
mn017|but um|D|Bmr026
mn017|so you know that might be useful for the people who train the the digit recognizers to to use uh something other than t i digits.|S|Bmr026
me011|yeah.|D|Bmr026
me013|well they been using timit.|S|Bmr026
mn017|okay.|S|Bmr026
me013|that|D|Bmr026
me013|uh they they uh they experimented for a while with a bunch of different data bases with french and spanish and so forth because they're multi lingual tests.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me013|and and uh um and actually the best results they got were uh using timit.|S|Bmr026
me011|huh.|B|Bmr026
me013|uh but uh which so that's what they're they're using now.|S|Bmr026
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr026
me013|but but yeah certainly if we um|D|Bmr026
me013|if we knew what the structure of what we're doing there was.|S|Bmr026
me013|i mean there's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh noise robustness algorithms.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me013|so we don't know exactly which combination we're going to be going with.|S|Bmr026
me013|once we know then the trainable parts of it it'd be great to run lots of lots of stuff through.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|right.|B|Bmr026
mn017|well that was that.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and then i guess chuck and i had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem uh system.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and you want to you want to see where that stands?|Q|Bmr026
me018|well i'm|D|Bmr026
me018|yeah so andreas uh brought over the uh alignments that the s r i system uses.|S|Bmr026
me018|and so i'm in the process of um converting those alignments into uh label files that we can use to train uh a new net with.|S|Bmr026
me018|and uh so then i'll train the net.|S|Bmr026
me018|and|D|Bmr026
mn017|and one side effect of that would be that it's um that the phone set would change.|S|Bmr026
me018|right.|B|Bmr026
mn017|so the m l p would be trained on i think only forty six or forty eight|D|Bmr026
me018|eight.|S|Bmr026
mn017|forty eight phones.|S|Bmr026
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|uh which is smaller than the um than the phone set that that we've been using so far.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|and that that that will probably help actually.|S|Bmr026
me018|so it's a little different.|S|Bmr026
mn017|because um the fewer dimensions uh the less trouble probably with the as far as just the um um|D|Bmr026
mn017|just|D|Bmr026
mn017|you know we want to try things like deltas on the tandem features.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and so you have to multiply everything by two or three.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and so you know fewer dimensions in the phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view.|S|Bmr026
me013|sure.|F|Bmr026
me013|although we i mean it's not that many fewer and and and we take a k l t anyway so we could|D|Bmr026
mn017|right.|F|Bmr026
mn017|exactly.|F|Bmr026
mn017|so so that was the other thing.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|and then we wanted to just limit it to maybe uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um front end.|S|Bmr026
mn017|so that would mean just doing the top i don't know ten or twelve or something of the k l t dimensions.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah and i think and we again check we should check with stephane.|S|Bmr026
me013|my impression was that when we did that before that had very little uh he didn't lose very much.|S|Bmr026
mn017|right.|B|Bmr026
me018|by just taking the top whatever?|Q|Bmr026
me011|yep.|B|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|but then|D|Bmr026
mn017|and then something|D|Bmr026
mn017|once we have the new m l p trained up uh one thing i wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh like a standard hybrid system that is based on you know those features.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uh and uh retrain m l p and also the you know the dictionary that we use for the hub five system.|S|Bmr026
me013|and the and the base starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from from a pretty decent system.|S|Bmr026
mn017|exactly.|S|Bmr026
me018|right.|B|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|so that would basically give us a um more hopefully a a better system.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|um because you know compared to what eric did a while ago where he trained up i think a system based on broadcast news.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and then uh retraining it on switchboard.|S|Bmr026
mn017|or uh and|D|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|but he i think he he didn't he probably didn't use all the training data that was available.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and his dictionary probably wasn't as tuned to um conversational speech as as the as ours is.|S|Bmr026
mn017|so|D|Bmr026
me013|that's that's certainly one thing yeah.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and the dictionary made a huge difference.|S|Bmr026
me013|uh yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|uh we we made some improvements to the dictionary's uh to the dictionary about two years ago.|S|Bmr026
mn017|which resulted in a uh something like a four per cent absolute error rate reduction on switchboard.|S|Bmr026
mn017|which|D|Bmr026
me013|well the other thing is dipping deep into history and into uh our resource management days when we were collaborating with s r i before.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|S|Bmr026
me013|uh it was i think it is was a really key uh starting point for us that we actually got our alignment.|S|Bmr026
me013|when we were working together we got our initial alignments from decipher uh at the time.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me013|uh and later we got away from it because because once we had decent systems going then it was it was typically better to use our own systems.|S|Bmr026
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me013|because they were consistent.|S|Bmr026
me013|but but certainly to start off when we were trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty per cent error uh rate.|S|Bmr026
me013|uh but that was a that was a good good good way to start.|S|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|okay.|B|Bmr026
me013|and we're not quite that bad with our our switchboard systems but it was they certainly aren't as good as s r i's.|S|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me013|so|D|Bmr026
me018|what is the performance on the best switchboard system that we've done?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|right.|B|Bmr026
me018|roughly?|Q|Bmr026
me013|well the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty per cent error.|S|Bmr026
me013|and uh it was|D|Bmr026
me013|i think there's just a whole lot of things that uh no one ever had time for.|S|Bmr026
me013|we never did really fix up the dictionary.|S|Bmr026
me013|uh we always had a list of a half dozen things that we were going to do.|S|Bmr026
me013|and and a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did.|S|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|huh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|but that|D|Bmr026
me013|uh we never did never did any adaptation.|S|Bmr026
mn017|even that that number|D|Bmr026
mn017|right.|F|Bmr026
me013|uh we never did any|D|Bmr026
mn017|and and that number i think was on switchboard one data.|S|Bmr026
mn017|right?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|where the error rate now is in the twenties.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr026
mn017|so um|D|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr026
me013|so we were|D|Bmr026
mn017|that's yet|D|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr026
me013|we were probably at least a factor or two off.|S|Bmr026
mn017|right.|B|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|so it would be so it would be good to sort of uh|D|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|just at least to give us an idea of how well the hybrid system would do.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me013|but i think again it's|D|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr026
me013|it's the it's the conversational speech bit.|S|Bmr026
me013|because our our broadcast news system is actually pretty good.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me013|he knows.|S|Bmr026
mn017|right.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and the other thing that that would help us to evaluate is to see how well the m l p is trained up.|S|Bmr026
mn017|right?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|because it's a pretty good um indicator of that.|S|Bmr026
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|so it's sort of a sanity check of the m l p outputs before we go ahead and train up the uh you know use them as a basis for the tandem system.|S|Bmr026
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me013|it'll still probably be worse.|S|Bmr026
me013|i mean it's it'd be context independent and so on.|S|Bmr026
mn017|no.|S|Bmr026
mn017|sure.|S|Bmr026
me018|should we should we bother with um using the net before doing uh embedded training?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|not|D|Bmr026
mn017|but|D|Bmr026
me013|but|D|Bmr026
me018|i mean should should we even use that?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|oh oh that's a good question.|S|Bmr026
me018|or should i just go straight to|D|Bmr026
mn017|yeah we we weren't sure whether it's worth to just use the alignments um from the s r i recognizer.|S|Bmr026
mn017|or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of embedded training where you realign.|S|Bmr026
me011|try it.|S|Bmr026
me011|you run it.|S|Bmr026
me011|keep keep both versions.|S|Bmr026
me011|see which one's better.|S|Bmr026
me013|uh yeah.|S|Bmr026
me013|i mean i think i agree with|D|Bmr026
me013|i mean basically you would then you proceed with the embedded training.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me013|it's going to take you a while to train at this net anyway.|S|Bmr026
mn017|right.|B|Bmr026
me013|and while it's training you may as well test the one you have and see how it did.|S|Bmr026
mn017|okay.|S|Bmr026
me018|huh.|B|Bmr026
mn017|all right.|B|Bmr026
me011|i could make arguments either way.|S|Bmr026
mn017|but but so i|D|Bmr026
me011|you know it's|D|Bmr026
mn017|well but|D|Bmr026
me011|sort of given up guessing.|S|Bmr026
mn017|but in your experience i mean uh have you seen big improvements in on some tasks with embedded training?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|or was it sort of smallish uh improvements that you got?|Q|Bmr026
me013|uh well it depended on the task.|S|Bmr026
me013|i mean i think in this one i would sort of expect it to be important.|S|Bmr026
mn017|right.|B|Bmr026
me013|because we're coming from uh alignments that were achieved with an extremely different system.|S|Bmr026
mn017|that are from another|D|Bmr026
mn017|right.|B|Bmr026
mn017|right.|B|Bmr026
me011|although i mean we've done it with when we were combining with the cambridge recurrent neural net embedded training made it worse.|S|Bmr026
me013|uh|F|Bmr026
me011|which i've never figured out.|S|Bmr026
me013|right.|S|Bmr026
me013|but i mean|D|Bmr026
me011|i think it's a bug.|S|Bmr026
mn017|so you you started training with outputs from a with alignments that were generated by the cambridge uh system?|Q|Bmr026
me011|yep.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and then|D|Bmr026
mn017|uh uh|F|Bmr026
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr026
mn017|well that might probably just|D|Bmr026
mn017|huh.|F|Bmr026
mn017|that was probably because your initial system i mean your system was worse than cambridge's.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and you um|D|Bmr026
me013|was it?|Q|Bmr026
me013|i don't think it was.|S|Bmr026
me011|no.|S|Bmr026
me011|they were they were comparable.|S|Bmr026
mn017|it wasn't?|Q|Bmr026
me013|no.|S|Bmr026
mn017|really?|Q|Bmr026
me011|they were very close.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|that's weird.|S|Bmr026
me013|excuse me?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|that's that's weird.|S|Bmr026
mn017|no i mean it's weird that it did|D|Bmr026
me013|oh!|S|Bmr026
me011|that's what i said.|S|Bmr026
mn017|i'm sorry.|S|Bmr026
mn017|it's|D|Bmr026
mn017|it's weird that it got worse.|S|Bmr026
me018|that's ambiguous.|S|Bmr026
me013|um no.|S|Bmr026
me013|uh we've i mean and with the numbers o g i numbers task we've seen a number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better.|S|Bmr026
mn017|oh actually it's not that weird.|S|Bmr026
mn017|because we have seen|D|Bmr026
mn017|we have seen cases where acoustic retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than better.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr026
me013|it just|D|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me013|but i but i would i would suspect that something that that had um a very different um feature set for instance.|S|Bmr026
me013|i mean they were using pretty similar feature sets to us.|S|Bmr026
me011|yep.|B|Bmr026
me013|i i would expect that something that had a different feature set would would uh benefit from.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me018|what about uh hidden unit size on this?|Q|Bmr026
me013|oh wait a minute.|S|Bmr026
me013|and the other thing uh|D|Bmr026
me018|oh.|B|Bmr026
me013|sorry.|S|Bmr026
me013|it was the other thing is that what was in common to the cambridge system and our system is they both were training posteriors.|S|Bmr026
me011|right.|B|Bmr026
me013|so i mean uh that's another pretty big difference.|S|Bmr026
me011|uh yeah.|B|Bmr026
me011|that's another big difference.|S|Bmr026
me013|and uh one at least|D|Bmr026
me013|back at|D|Bmr026
mn017|you mean with soft targets?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|or|D|Bmr026
mn017|sorry i'm|D|Bmr026
mn017|i missed|D|Bmr026
mn017|what what's the key issue here?|Q|Bmr026
me013|oh that uh both the cambridge system and our system were were training posteriors.|S|Bmr026
me013|and if we're we're coming from alignments coming from the s r i system it's a likelihood based system.|S|Bmr026
me013|so so that's another difference.|S|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me013|i mean you know there's different front end different different uh um training criterion.|S|Bmr026
me013|uh i would think that in that an embedded uh embedded uh training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me013|but we don't know.|S|Bmr026
mn017|okay.|B|Bmr026
me013|you going to say something?|Q|Bmr026
me018|yeah.|S|Bmr026
me018|i was wondering uh you know what size net i should|D|Bmr026
me018|anybody have any intuitions or suggestions?|Q|Bmr026
me013|uh how much training data?|Q|Bmr026
me018|well i was going to start off with the small train set.|S|Bmr026
me013|and how how many hours is that?|Q|Bmr026
me018|that's why i was|D|Bmr026
me018|i i'm not sure how much that is.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uh i think that has about|D|Bmr026
mn017|well you'd would be gender dependent training.|S|Bmr026
mn017|right?|Q|Bmr026
me018|gender dependent yeah.|S|Bmr026
mn017|so so i think it's uh that's about huh something like thirty hours.|S|Bmr026
me018|thirty hours?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|thirty hours per gender.|S|Bmr026
me011|i'm not sure what this'll mean.|D|Bmr026
me018|in the small training set?|Q|Bmr026
me011|hello?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|i i think so.|S|Bmr026
mn017|i'll|D|Bmr026
me011|excuse me?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|it's definitely less than a hundred.|S|Bmr026
mn017|you know it's more like like thirty forty hours.|S|Bmr026
me011|all right.|S|Bmr026
mn017|something like that.|S|Bmr026
me011|wrong number.|S|Bmr026
me018|they called to tell us that?|Q|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|D|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr026
me013|um so uh after run|D|Bmr026
me018|i mean i didn't want to do too big.|S|Bmr026
me013|right.|S|Bmr026
me018|just|D|Bmr026
me013|so|D|Bmr026
me013|at least a couple thousand hidden units.|S|Bmr026
me013|i mean|D|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me013|it's it's the thing i'll i'll think about it a little more.|S|Bmr026
me013|but it it'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand.|S|Bmr026
me018|huh.|B|Bmr026
me013|you definitely wouldn't want the eight thousand.|S|Bmr026
me013|it's it's more than|D|Bmr026
me018|and a thousand is too small?|Q|Bmr026
me013|oh let me think about it.|F|Bmr026
me013|but i think that that uh at some point there's diminishing returns.|S|Bmr026
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me013|i mean it doesn't actually get worse typically.|S|Bmr026
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me013|but it but but there is diminishing returns.|S|Bmr026
me013|and you're doubling the amount of time.|S|Bmr026
mn017|remember you'll have a smaller output layer so there's going to be fewer parameters there.|S|Bmr026
me011|but not by a lot.|S|Bmr026
me013|not by much.|S|Bmr026
mn017|and then|D|Bmr026
me013|fifty fifty four to forty eight?|Q|Bmr026
me011|vast majority is from the input unit.|S|Bmr026
mn017|okay.|S|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me013|it'll have a very tiny effect.|S|Bmr026
me011|right because you used the context windows.|S|Bmr026
me011|and so the input to hidden is much much larger.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|oh i see.|S|Bmr026
mn017|i see.|S|Bmr026
mn017|yeah of course.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
mn017|yeah.|D|Bmr026
mn017|it's negligible okay.|S|Bmr026
me013|yeah so it's it'd be way way less than ten per cent of the difference.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me013|uh there's uh|D|Bmr026
me013|how how big|D|Bmr026
me013|let's see.|F|Bmr026
me013|what am i trying to think of?|Q|Bmr026
me018|the the net that that we did use already uh was eight thousand hidden units.|S|Bmr026
me018|and that's the one that eric trained up.|S|Bmr026
me013|right.|S|Bmr026
me013|and that was trained up on uh like a hundred and forty hours of of speech.|S|Bmr026
mn017|was that gender dependent or independent?|Q|Bmr026
me018|gender dependent.|S|Bmr026
me013|oh.|S|Bmr026
me013|so that would be like trained on sixty or seventy hours.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me013|so uh|F|Bmr026
me013|yeah definitely not the one thousand uh two thousand|D|Bmr026
me013|i mean the four thousand will be better.|S|Bmr026
me013|and the two thousand will be almost will be faster and almost as good.|S|Bmr026
me011|it'll be faster.|S|Bmr026
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me013|so|F|Bmr026
me018|maybe i'll start off with two thousand just to see.|S|Bmr026
mn017|uhhuh.|B|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr026
mn017|okay.|B|Bmr026
me018|okay.|B|Bmr026
me013|yeah thirty hours is like a hundred and ten thousand uh seconds.|S|Bmr026
me013|uh so that's like eleven eleven million frames.|S|Bmr026
me013|and a two thousand hidden unit net is uh i guess about seven eight hundred thousand parameters.|S|Bmr026
me013|so that's probably that's probably fine.|S|Bmr026
me013|i mean a four thousand is well within the range that you could benefit from.|S|Bmr026
me013|but the two thousand would be faster.|S|Bmr026
me013|so|F|Bmr026
mn017|right.|F|Bmr026
mn017|i actually have to go.|S|Bmr026
mn017|so|F|Bmr026
me013|all right.|S|Bmr026
me013|uncle bernie's rule is ten to one.|S|Bmr026
me013|bernie woodrow's rule of|D|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr026
me013|uncle bernie|D|Bmr026
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me013|yes sir.|S|Bmr026
me011|we're just waiting for you to leave.|S|Bmr026
me011|anything else?|Q|Bmr026
me013|nah.|S|Bmr026
me013|since we have nothing to talk about we only talked for an hour.|S|Bmr026
me011|okay.|S|Bmr026
me013|so|F|Bmr026
me011|if|D|Bmr026
me011|yeah that's right.|S|Bmr026
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr026
me011|uh well we started late.|S|Bmr026
