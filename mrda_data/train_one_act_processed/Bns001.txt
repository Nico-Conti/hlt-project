mn082|uh okay.|F|Bns001
mn082|so then let's start with our weekly meeting.|S|Bns001
mn082|the last time's uh we learned too much i believe.|S|Bns001
mn082|so|F|Bns001
mn082|uh today i have two topics.|S|Bns001
mn082|and the first topic um we have a new member in our group.|S|Bns001
mn082|miguel sanchez.|S|Bns001
mn082|i believe everybody knows him very well in the meantime because he stayed here quite a little time.|S|Bns001
mn021|hi.|S|Bns001
mn082|and i think he is talking to everybody in the meantime.|S|Bns001
mn082|so but anyway i would like that miguel sanchez will introduce himself a little bit concerning his background what he intend to do.|S|Bns001
mn082|and because i discussing with him uh uh many things concerning uh his skills and what the n.s.a. group intends to do.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn082|i hope there will be a match uh then for his future work.|S|Bns001
mn082|and the second topic is then to discuss a proposal in much more detail.|S|Bns001
mn082|i believe we still haven't left our starting position.|S|Bns001
mn082|and um yesterday i also discussed with wilbert some things.|S|Bns001
mn082|and i would like to focus on the question what problem we are going to solve with such a proposal.|S|Bns001
mn082|not so will they have a common activity within the group itself and maybe with other partners outside.|S|Bns001
mn082|but the technical problem.|S|Bns001
mn082|but that's under the second topic.|S|Bns001
mn082|so first i would like that miguel will told us a little bit about his skills and and uh his background.|S|Bns001
mn021|okay.|S|Bns001
mn021|okay.|S|Bns001
mn021|thank you joe.|S|Bns001
mn082|so please.|S|Bns001
mn021|well i uh as all of you know i came from from spain.|S|Bns001
mn021|from the uh polytechnic university of valencia.|S|Bns001
mn021|and uh i um just finished my p.h.d. thesis about uh power saving techniques for wireless networking.|S|Bns001
mn021|uh in fact i have developed an algorithm to control the radio frequency power uh of a wireless transceiver.|S|Bns001
mn021|and uh i've been working also in routing issues especially in the so-called ad hoc wireless networks.|S|Bns001
mn021|where uh you have a set of uh mobile nodes and no other infrastructure.|S|Bns001
mn021|no base stations.|S|Bns001
mn021|so all the routing functions are done by the node by the same nodes.|S|Bns001
mn021|okay?|Q|Bns001
mn021|so nodes act as both end points and routers.|S|Bns001
mn021|uh|F|Bns001
mn021|i've in the study for some time these kind of networks.|S|Bns001
mn021|and uh in fact there are a lot of of research uh articles about this this kind of networks because you know uh huh infrastructure based network network has been a long topic of research.|S|Bns001
mn021|so|F|Bns001
mn021|for example routing on on wired networks is a a topic still to be researched.|S|Bns001
mn021|but it has an important background.|S|Bns001
mn021|but mobile this kind of mobile networks is a little bit uh newer.|S|Bns001
mn021|especially because uh until not so long uh the the things were too heavy to have a computer a wireless transceiver on a more or less portable thing.|S|Bns001
mn021|so with the advent of this new technology low power uh high uh processing capability and wireless uh networking capability in a really small package new kind of devices are are being built and are appearing in the market.|S|Bns001
mn021|and uh well this is more or less what i have done.|S|Bns001
mn021|and the kind of uh things i'm interested is more or less all around this these kind of networks.|S|Bns001
mn021|but i could say uh in general mobile service is not only about uh these specific kind of networks.|S|Bns001
mn021|but in general about uh services uh over mobile or services that can benefit from the uh capability of nodes to move around.|S|Bns001
mn021|and uh well i i've been teaching now for twelve years uh at a computer sciences school in my university.|S|Bns001
mn021|i've been teaching computer networks.|S|Bns001
mn021|and well i am more or less uh knowledgeable about well t.c.p.i.p. networking i.s.o. uh networking.|S|Bns001
mn021|and uh|F|Bns001
mn021|well i'm i'm a computer guy.|S|Bns001
mn021|so i'm really um well i can say uh proudly uh more or less computer skilled.|S|Bns001
mn021|i mean uh operating systems uh programming languages uh networking.|S|Bns001
mn021|so this kind of things i think i'm more or less well-trained.|S|Bns001
mn021|so|F|Bns001
mn021|this is i think um my first presentation.|S|Bns001
mn021|next maybe next meeting i will uh do a small sketch about uh my past work and well presenting some a little bit more detailed approach with some schemes and and some things from previous talks so you can have a better idea of the kind of work i've been doing.|S|Bns001
mn021|okay?|Q|Bns001
mn082|uhhuh.|S|Bns001
mn021|thank you.|S|Bns001
mn082|so thanks miguel.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah we discussed it yesterday that you'll maybe will have a talk next tuesday.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|but give me a sign and send me an abstract so that i can announce it then for the next meeting.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn021|that's okay.|S|Bns001
mn082|um|F|Bns001
mn082|one short other topic is uh claudia did a lot of work concerning the web pages in the meantime.|S|Bns001
fn083|oh.|S|Bns001
fn083|okay.|S|Bns001
mn082|and despite busy stuff with waivers and uh and visas and whatever uh she found the time to um write with what we discussed before and in the form of h.t.m.l. stuff.|S|Bns001
mn082|and we want to put it on the web pages in the next days.|S|Bns001
mn082|so i will send an email then to everybody that they should check their web pages whether they're aligned with um their own views and opinions of what we should what should be presented on the web pages.|S|Bns001
mn082|and any feedback is then well appreciated.|S|Bns001
mn082|no?|D|Bns001
mn021|okay.|B|Bns001
mn082|so|F|Bns001
mn082|let's switch to the project proposal.|S|Bns001
mn082|um i mentioned that it is still|D|Bns001
fn083|uh.|F|Bns001
fn083|sorry.|S|Bns001
fn083|can i|D|Bns001
mn082|yeah?|Q|Bns001
fn083|maybe i can add something.|S|Bns001
mn082|claudia|D|Bns001
fn083|yeah if there's anything else which we what we could add on the web site.|S|Bns001
fn083|so for example if you have a small abstract or some pictures or whatever about the work you did before what you are planning to do here that would be fine.|S|Bns001
mn021|okay.|S|Bns001
fn083|because now we can add some more stuff there.|S|Bns001
fn083|or if you have something or if somebody has some slides or articles whatever he wants to be published there.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|then everybody sees the structure how it is uh structured really structured.|S|Bns001
fn083|yeah.|S|Bns001
fn083|and|F|Bns001
mn082|then maybe you can easy offer some additional input which should be presented then on the web pages.|S|Bns001
fn083|yeah it depends what what everybody wants to do.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
fn083|so|F|Bns001
fn083|about the projects will be something.|S|Bns001
fn083|then about publications will be another point.|S|Bns001
fn083|and yeah additional information about how is life in berkeley and yep i don't know some some hints some web sites or links which are useful when somebody arrives or stuff like that.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah it is.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B|Bns001
mn082|half collection of necessary information.|S|Bns001
mn030|but there's no personal homepage for everybody?|Q|Bns001
mn030|or is it planned or not?|Q|Bns001
mn082|yeah you can have|D|Bns001
mn030|or|F|Bns001
mn082|yeah you can have it.|S|Bns001
mn082|because as uh uh uh|D|Bns001
mn030|i'm not interested in this.|S|Bns001
mn030|that makes work.|S|Bns001
mn082|no.|S|Bns001
mn082|but this is oh uh everybody's obliged to do it for his own you know.|S|Bns001
mn030|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|so there is not uh claudia is not the webmaster here to uh get the collection for for for everything.|S|Bns001
mn030|okay.|S|Bns001
fn083|oh oh no i'm not doing it for everybody.|S|Bns001
mn082|so|F|Bns001
fn083|but what i can|D|Bns001
mn082|this is responsible for uh everybody's responsible for his own.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|F|Bns001
fn083|yeah but but what is planned is that i do something like previous you know layout and give everybody the uh uh the possibility to the chance to put his content inside.|S|Bns001
mn030|sure.|B|Bns001
mn030|okay.|S|Bns001
mn030|his name and so on.|S|Bns001
fn083|so that the layout is for everybody the same.|S|Bns001
mn030|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn021|well like have a blueprint.|S|Bns001
fn083|so about the projects and stuff.|S|Bns001
mn030|okay.|B|Bns001
mn030|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
fn083|so there will be something.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|okay.|S|Bns001
mn082|thanks.|S|Bns001
mn082|so|F|Bns001
mn082|let's switch to the proposal.|S|Bns001
mn082|i ask everybody whether read it in the meantime and understand everything.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|D|Bns001
mn082|everybody say yes?|Q|Bns001
mn082|yeah?|Q|Bns001
mn030|yes.|S|Bns001
mn082|yes.|S|Bns001
mn082|okay.|S|Bns001
mn082|um|F|Bns001
mn082|from my point of view as i mentioned before we still in the starting position.|S|Bns001
mn082|i think the four building blocks on the network level will have really a major impact on on current um available wireless networks and uh also for future generations.|S|Bns001
mn082|and what the missing thing is really what kind of problem we are want to solve with such a project proposal.|S|Bns001
mn082|and wilbert yesterday mentioned and he is right that what kind of maybe service we are really going to offer.|S|Bns001
mn082|the linkage between such kind of application also interactive multimedia application and uh this kind of networking stuff is um maybe not very well aligned.|S|Bns001
mn082|because there will be of course a portion of mobile access to such kind of application.|S|Bns001
mn082|but i think that's not the majority.|S|Bns001
mn082|and that is not the major focus of um this kind of um this kind of application anyway.|S|Bns001
mn082|so i would like to to uh split in principle the discussions of what kind of application tsk um far away.|S|Bns001
mn082|and i would like to more to focus if we have certain kind of vision concerning these building blocks and the network um what kind of problem we are going to solve.|S|Bns001
mn082|what kind of uh um um glue between these four building blocks exists.|S|Bns001
mn082|and what kind of synergy effects in principle as if they work and fit very well together exists for networking stuff.|S|Bns001
mn082|and what kind of service could we provide in that area.|S|Bns001
mn082|we will have these kind of uh really closely working together of these four building blocks.|S|Bns001
mn082|so maybe uh wilbert you can start to oder to to tell the group about what you mentioned yesterday concerning certain kind of ideas.|S|Bns001
mn082|maybe it's a brainstorming um of of these things.|S|Bns001
mn082|and maybe we can comment later on these uh these ideas.|S|Bns001
mn082|and i saw you still discuss with with uh mark right?|S|Bns001
mn082|some stuff.|S|Bns001
mn082|was it also related with with these things?|Q|Bns001
mn081|no.|S|Bns001
mn082|no.|S|Bns001
mn082|okay it was.|S|Bns001
mn081|this afternoon you mean?|Q|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn081|no this was unrelated to to the things of yesterday and last weeks.|S|Bns001
mn082|okay.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|then maybe then one one uh sentence before.|S|Bns001
mn082|i believe everybody fits very well in these kind of things.|S|Bns001
mn082|because from the mathematical description with q.s. in advance me as an expert for quality of service and uh michael as an expert for uh m.p.l.s. and wilbert an expert for for multicast and uh i discussed with miguel it's uh maybe a little bit the shift to active routing.|S|Bns001
mn082|but it is still in the area of routing.|S|Bns001
mn082|so my idea is in principle to have independently of any funding independently of any outer contact such such a core activity in principle.|S|Bns001
mn082|and we can see how much from the outer world can fit in.|S|Bns001
mn082|first of all the first stage is the institution which is behind everybody.|S|Bns001
mn082|that means uh k.p.n. in your case and siemens in our case.|S|Bns001
mn082|and maybe then in the broader world here other partners registered in the proposal|D|Bns001
mn082|tomorrow i will go to cisco for instance.|S|Bns001
mn082|and i will discuss uh all this kind of things.|S|Bns001
mn082|maybe they have certain additional activities and they're interested in the results before.|S|Bns001
mn082|the benefit here is in principle that the results are available.|S|Bns001
mn082|they are not restricted any way.|S|Bns001
mn082|if you have your own common activity that makes a little bit more easier.|S|Bns001
mn082|and uh if there is a technical linkage between such uh um between the outer world and us okay the better it is.|S|Bns001
mn082|but anyway if we come to a certain kind of uh common work within the core of the n.s.a. group i think that's really beneficial to everybody.|S|Bns001
mn082|and uh especially wilbert if you have in mind to go in the huh uh really from the project proposal view i think we can build it on this this core.|S|Bns001
mn082|you know?|Q|Bns001
mn082|and go to the outer world with and and and align it in a certain way.|S|Bns001
mn082|for instance that it also fit maybe to k.p.n. and siemens and in other companies.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|F|Bns001
mn081|yeah and this probably has to be a brainstorm right now.|S|Bns001
mn082|yep.|S|Bns001
mn081|um what i told joachim yesterday was that uh uh for my company the company i work for they are more interested in in an explicit service than in core technology.|S|Bns001
mn081|me on the other hand i'm more interested in uh core service or core technology myself.|S|Bns001
mn081|so i'm i was thinking about uh how i could combine the both of them.|S|Bns001
mn081|k.p.n. was um they're interested in having uh like six people or something working on the project for one year.|S|Bns001
mn081|or maybe uh three people working on the project for two years.|S|Bns001
mn081|and have a kind of a demonstration uh for a specifically u.m.t.s. service.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn081|i was thinking that um as a well not really a u.m.t.s. service but yesterday what i discussed with joachim was uh a little bit based on your ad hoc networking also.|S|Bns001
mn081|that it would be interesting to have a kind of a device where you can switch from a wavelan technology to um u.m.t.s.|S|Bns001
mn081|i think that's uh it's in in the future that will be a main competitor of uh of u.m.t.s.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B|Bns001
mn081|too like the the the lucent uh equipment has a huge scope already.|S|Bns001
mn081|like five hundred feet or or even more sometimes.|S|Bns001
mn081|so that's it's might be interesting for a service to walk into a building or whatever is available on that network.|S|Bns001
mn081|you can switch from u.m.t.s. or uh uh to wavelan technologies.|S|Bns001
mn082|huh.|B|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B|Bns001
mn082|uh maybe i will write a few keywords on the on the whiteboard.|S|Bns001
mn081|sure.|S|Bns001
mn082|okay?|Q|Bns001
mn081|of course it sounds strange for a company that does u.m.t.s. to switch to to be able to switch or provide the service to switch to wavelan.|S|Bns001
mn081|but at the end it makes it easier for your and cheaper for your customers.|S|Bns001
mn081|so if they don't do it somebody else will probably do it.|S|Bns001
mn021|and you can build a a an a a double technology adapter too.|S|Bns001
mn021|so you can market these double technology adapters.|S|Bns001
mn021|and this can be a a potential uh um you know uh income too.|S|Bns001
mn081|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn021|because you just have to license uh uh wavelan technology.|S|Bns001
mn021|you can build uh the whole thing.|S|Bns001
mn081|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn021|this u. u.m.t.s. wavelan mixed together.|S|Bns001
mn081|and|D|Bns001
mn081|yeah something like that could be possible.|S|Bns001
mn081|maybe even a u.m.t.s. to wavelan gateway.|S|Bns001
mn081|or i'm not sure if that's possible like u. if u.m.t.s. contains redirects or whatever like switches.|S|Bns001
mn081|i'm not sure about it.|S|Bns001
mn081|it could be.|S|Bns001
mn021|huh.|B|Bns001
mn021|i think they are using different uh radio technologies.|S|Bns001
mn021|so uh at the physical level they're they're they are not compatible.|S|Bns001
mn081|it's not a problem.|S|Bns001
mn081|no but you could have a u.m.t.s. gateway that translates everything to that uh local.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn081|if you will.|S|Bns001
mn021|that that's right.|S|Bns001
mn082|yet the basic idea is in principle to switch seamlessly between wireless lan technology whatever and u.m.t.s.|S|Bns001
mn082|right?|Q|Bns001
mn081|yes.|S|Bns001
mn082|and you see the benefit that in principle the customer will save a lot of money.|S|Bns001
mn082|because if in-house communication like wavelan or maybe i see it also in the american market some wavelan communication in the outer world will be available the and that is your assumption that the more cost uh extensive um u.m.t.s. connection could be principle used i would like to say over wavelan.|S|Bns001
mn082|and then i have a normal wavelan connection right?|S|Bns001
mn081|yes.|S|Bns001
mn082|and the router and the wavelan connection goes into the core internet elsewhere.|S|Bns001
mn082|and the connection is not dropped between this seamless hand off i would like to say.|S|Bns001
mn081|uhhuh.|S|Bns001
mn082|right?|Q|Bns001
mn082|or what or|D|Bns001
mn081|well.|F|Bns001
mn081|if connection is lost i am i'm not sure if sometimes you'd simply have to drop a connection if you have outstanding connections.|S|Bns001
mn082|what|D|Bns001
mn035|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn081|but that's uh one thing of the internet.|S|Bns001
mn081|right?|Q|Bns001
mn081|it's should be able to unplug a host bring it somewhere else and everything continues like it should be.|S|Bns001
mn081|i'm not sure if it's uh if you really have to uh save a connection for all applications.|S|Bns001
mn081|i i don't think so.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah but if this is the final goal.|S|Bns001
mn082|it should be as much as possible available that you do not have to break the connection if you switch between the subnets' technology.|S|Bns001
mn082|right?|Q|Bns001
mn021|yeah but i i have a point uh regarding the this question is uh the cost function.|S|Bns001
mn021|i mean.|F|Bns001
mn021|uh|F|Bns001
mn021|what about the user who is switching from one let's say zero cost area network to another network where he has to pay?|Q|Bns001
mn021|it is okay for the service to continue when he uh switches from one network to another.|S|Bns001
mn021|but probably the user wants to be aware that he's switching from one place from one network to another.|S|Bns001
mn021|because maybe while he's uh having let's say a video conference uh over the the wavelan oh he's not paying any extra cost.|S|Bns001
mn021|but when he continues with this service on the u.m.t.s. he's having to cover uh an important let's say an important cost or some cost non-null cost.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|non-null.|S|Bns001
mn021|so uh|F|Bns001
mn021|this can be something that probably the user wants to be aware of.|S|Bns001
mn021|of course this doesn't mean that the user wants the connection to be dropped when he switches to the uh uh from the zero cost area network to to the uh um non-null cost area network.|S|Bns001
mn021|but maybe some users want to do this.|S|Bns001
mn021|because they say okay.|S|Bns001
mn021|i'm not willing to pay any back for this service.|S|Bns001
mn021|because i'm just watching uh you know the sports news.|S|Bns001
mn021|so if i switch if if because of my motion i'm switching or i'm going out of the coverage of the of the uh wave uh wireless uh local area network well i i want the service to be uh stopped.|S|Bns001
mn021|and this can be some pattern then that some users will follow.|S|Bns001
mn035|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah but if your|D|Bns001
mn082|uh i believe everybody is aware about the u.s.a.i.a. architecture.|S|Bns001
mn082|and uh this one is here this stuff is here also related to this kind what is mentioned there concerning the end system.|S|Bns001
mn082|and in my uh considered end system there is a certain kind of policy concerning how to use subnets technologies and and all these kind of things.|S|Bns001
mn082|how to use quality of service you know in advance.|S|Bns001
mn082|because you have to pay for certain technologies and maybe for certain services.|S|Bns001
mn082|and that should not be done automatically.|S|Bns001
mn082|but it could be done automatically.|S|Bns001
mn082|but nevertheless there must be a certain kind of um user interaction always possible that you could set up a certain kind of mini database how to deal with all these kind of things.|S|Bns001
mn082|i think that's not a problem.|S|Bns001
mn082|but uh what i i would like to ask wilbert here and we discuss it yesterday is it only the usage of that p.c.m.c.i.a. card where you have instead of g.s.m. today u.m.t.s. and instead of wireless lan today also wireless lan.|S|Bns001
mn082|remember your four and one card uh concerning um|D|Bns001
mn082|what is the name from|D|Bns001
mn082|no.|S|Bns001
mn082|dacom.|S|Bns001
mn081|oh the one i have sitcom?|S|Bns001
mn082|where you can enable four technologies and you plug in in your laptop.|S|Bns001
mn081|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|and then you have every four uh subnet layer technologies available in your laptop.|S|Bns001
mn082|is that the problem?|Q|Bns001
mn082|yeah that's not the problem.|S|Bns001
mn082|right.|S|Bns001
mn081|um|F|Bns001
mn081|well the switching itself could be a problem.|S|Bns001
mn082|why?|Q|Bns001
mn081|well it's a depends.|S|Bns001
mn081|maybe you are.|S|Bns001
mn081|i don't know.|S|Bns001
mn081|so that could be a topic for research.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah but this|D|Bns001
mn081|so maybe you know more about it.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah but this is only the probing to figure out that you get at a certain location the information that a certain coverage of a certain subnet technology is available.|S|Bns001
mn082|and if so then what miguel mentions then you add a certain kind of policy to switch or not to switch to this kind of technology.|S|Bns001
mn081|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|right?|Q|Bns001
mn081|yes.|S|Bns001
mn082|but this is end system related.|S|Bns001
mn082|that's not network related.|S|Bns001
mn082|i see no network related stuff within these in this uh idea.|S|Bns001
mn081|um|F|Bns001
mn082|it's only to set up|D|Bns001
mn082|for me it's like a laptop to plug one p.c.m.c.i.a. and currently will have two p.c.m.c.i.a. cards and i compare g.s.m. with u.m.t.s.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B|Bns001
mn082|and today i would like to have g.s.m.|S|Bns001
mn082|and then i have my g.s.m. connectivity.|S|Bns001
mn082|and i cannot use it other technology.|S|Bns001
mn082|only g.s.m. because the interfaces the driver interface does not permit me to switch between the between different technologies.|S|Bns001
mn082|so if i want to go to wireless lan i have to stop my connection and put in my wireless lan p.c.m.c.i.a. card.|S|Bns001
mn082|and then i can go on and set up the the same connection one more time.|S|Bns001
mn082|and what you have in mind to do it a bit more seamlessly and that makes an only sense for me if both technologies in principle were close together in that sense for application.|S|Bns001
mn082|for instance the application would be that i have my laptop here.|S|Bns001
mn082|and i work here with with my device.|S|Bns001
mn082|any kind of device.|S|Bns001
mn082|and i work here in wireless lan area.|S|Bns001
mn082|and then i go outside and want to go still on leaving the coverage of uh of the uh wireless lan.|S|Bns001
mn082|and at a certain state the device uh receives certain signals that the coverage of u.m.t.s. or g.s.m. is available.|S|Bns001
mn082|and at that state you automatically or based on the certain kind of user profile switched to the um u.m.t.s. or g.s.m. uh network.|S|Bns001
mn082|that's the only senseful application.|S|Bns001
mn082|from my understanding that means only to have a certain kind of control layer for the different drivers.|S|Bns001
mn082|which you also mentioned as a u.s.a.i.a. architecture.|S|Bns001
mn082|and uh then to do the switching for an existing stream or application between these uh transparently to this application between those uh these both technologies.|S|Bns001
mn082|maybe there's more potential.|S|Bns001
mn082|i don't see it.|S|Bns001
mn082|but maybe you have a additional idea.|S|Bns001
mn082|and i don't think that this end system device uh architecture which will come automatically.|S|Bns001
mn082|and i believe there's a lot of activity throughout the world.|S|Bns001
mn082|because this seamlessly communication is always mentioned elsewhere where you where you listen to.|S|Bns001
mn082|so|F|Bns001
mn082|uh|F|Bns001
mn081|if if you can leave it out the network that will be really cool.|S|Bns001
mn081|that's what you what i would like to do.|S|Bns001
mn081|so|F|Bns001
mn081|yes.|F|Bns001
mn021|but when quality of service comes to the uh scene well i think we have a a bigger problem.|S|Bns001
mn021|because maybe this this uh uh seamless migration cannot be seamless at all.|S|Bns001
mn021|because maybe the the quality of service we are getting when we are connected to a certain network let's say high-speed networking cannot be sustained when we are switching to a different technology.|S|Bns001
mn021|so this is another thing that is uh putting a little bit in more trouble our our scheme.|S|Bns001
mn021|or|F|Bns001
mn082|now i would like not to hear only three opinions.|S|Bns001
mn082|but maybe there are also other opinions.|S|Bns001
mn021|okay.|B|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn021|oh sorry.|S|Bns001
mn082|and maybe everybody should uh give a short|D|Bns001
mn035|i think you|D|Bns001
mn082|let us understand built for everybody and their whether their comments.|S|Bns001
mn035|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn035|i think we should|D|Bns001
mn035|in this thing of seamless handoff or handovers should think more maybe in different layers?|Q|Bns001
mn035|so one layer is having the seamless handover.|S|Bns001
mn035|it's clear if a technology doesn't provide that quality of service you can't do magic and have it.|S|Bns001
mn035|there are certain constraints on that.|S|Bns001
mn035|it's true.|S|Bns001
mn035|that's still in mind.|S|Bns001
mn035|but for with the cases there there it is possible.|S|Bns001
mn035|so that should be made possible then?|Q|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn035|so|F|Bns001
mn021|it can be done.|S|Bns001
mn021|it is just huh uh trying to to to to to pinpoint the the possible problems.|S|Bns001
mn035|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn035|there are still enough problems in doing it.|S|Bns001
mn035|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn035|yep.|S|Bns001
mn035|but it might be the wrong thing to promise uh ten megabits to everywhere.|S|Bns001
mn035|there you are.|S|Bns001
mn035|but saying okay if it's a if the technology is okay you can do it.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn021|in fact if you take the slower technology of the ones you are planning to to support you can offer this this uh this throughput as uh the minimum warranty you you can get.|S|Bns001
mn035|yep.|B|Bns001
mn035|yep.|B|Bns001
mn035|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn021|so if everybody is is asking for less than this minimum amount no problem at all.|S|Bns001
mn021|but in this case maybe not too much effort should be put on providing this quality of service.|S|Bns001
mn021|because you just have a usually a huge bandwidth compared on a a with what the user is is using.|S|Bns001
mn035|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn035|yep.|B|Bns001
mn035|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn021|i mean if you have a ten megabits bandwidth and the user is asking two kilobits per second of course you can uh build uh certain reserve mechanisms to warranty the user these two kilobits per second bandwidth.|S|Bns001
mn021|but probably in it isn't it is not worth because you have so many uh available bandwidths that maybe uh it is not a problem.|S|Bns001
fn083|huh?|Q|Bns001
fn083|oh!|S|Bns001
fn083|okay.|S|Bns001
mn082|uh|F|Bns001
mn082|okay.|S|Bns001
mn021|oh okay.|S|Bns001
mn082|good luck.|S|Bns001
mn081|the the thing is that we are looking for a research topic on on those uh four areas.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|and the building blocks.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|multicast not a topic.|S|Bns001
mn081|so|F|Bns001
mn081|so we|D|Bns001
mn082|routing?|Q|Bns001
mn081|so so we went through uh uh to through multicast.|S|Bns001
mn081|so this architecture with|D|Bns001
mn081|well at least no wireless environment or a mobile i.p. environment comparable to uh u.m.t.s. environments we really did not find any well difficulties there.|S|Bns001
mn081|on the blackboard that is.|S|Bns001
mn081|of course in real life there will probably be some problems.|S|Bns001
mn021|have you have you read about this uh barwan project held at berkeley university?|Q|Bns001
mn082|well what you the pointer the pointer you sent yesterday.|S|Bns001
mn081|iceberg?|Q|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|i i didn't find the time yeah to do so.|S|Bns001
mn021|okay.|S|Bns001
mn082|but|F|Bns001
mn082|uh|F|Bns001
mn081|you mean the iceberg project?|Q|Bns001
mn021|barwan.|S|Bns001
mn081|barwan of uh e.s.|D|Bns001
mn021|barwan.|S|Bns001
mn035|how's it start?|Q|Bns001
mn081|i know there's one that's of uh randy katz.|S|Bns001
mn021|uh it was another related project called daedalus.|S|Bns001
mn081|yes.|S|Bns001
mn021|and uh well it seems they what they were doing was some kind of uh things somehow similar to this.|S|Bns001
mn081|they worked together little bit with nokia?|Q|Bns001
mn021|uh don't know.|S|Bns001
mn081|palo alto?|Q|Bns001
mn081|mountain view?|Q|Bns001
mn021|i i i i just uh take a a quick uh look at the at the thing.|S|Bns001
mn021|because i i was uh read about this uh a long time ago.|S|Bns001
mn021|and it the the latest report i i found was in nineteen ninety eight.|S|Bns001
mn021|and in this report well they they they have uh some slides some uh papers some well a lot of things.|S|Bns001
mn081|huh.|B|Bns001
mn021|and well the main thing and the quick uh thing i i was uh looking at was a a video available in m. in m.p.g.m. peg format.|S|Bns001
mn021|and uh|F|Bns001
mn021|well what this video was presenting was a kind of test of of one guy with a portable computer moving across different networks.|S|Bns001
mn021|so starting at the c.s. department at berkeley.|S|Bns001
mn021|and then going out the street.|S|Bns001
mn021|switching to the a campus wide network.|S|Bns001
mn021|uh um i think it's a metricom uh network.|S|Bns001
mn021|which is uh a test|D|Bns001
mn082|a ricochet here right?|S|Bns001
mn021|ricochet.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn021|that's right.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn021|and then finally switching to i think it was city p.d. or something like this.|S|Bns001
mn021|okay?|Q|Bns001
mn021|i as uh as the as the user is moving out of the of the coverage area of this second network.|S|Bns001
mn021|and well what they have built is a a kind of uh proxy structure.|S|Bns001
mn021|so they are they are putting most of the work of this adaptational layer on on the side of the proxies.|S|Bns001
mn021|so the client or the server is not changed.|S|Bns001
mn021|it is the proxy the one that does the work.|S|Bns001
mn081|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn021|okay?|Q|Bns001
mn021|so you can even for example use|D|Bns001
mn021|it's the same?|Q|Bns001
mn082|uh we just discussed a lot about proxies.|S|Bns001
mn021|oh okay.|S|Bns001
mn082|that's a fun.|S|Bns001
mn081|i like them.|S|Bns001
mn081|so|F|Bns001
mn021|okay.|S|Bns001
mn021|i|D|Bns001
mn021|it is just that that well maybe we can we can take a look at oh maybe a more in-depth look at this project.|S|Bns001
mn021|just to see if we are doing the same or if we are doing something similar.|S|Bns001
mn021|it would be important for us to to highlight the differences.|S|Bns001
mn081|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn021|because if not well they can say oh you are doing the same thing.|S|Bns001
mn021|this was done now.|S|Bns001
mn081|or maybe talk to them about operations they thought of but didn't touch yet.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah well we are close.|S|Bns001
mn082|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn082|uh maybe a few comments.|S|Bns001
mn082|first of all um do you mind miguel to write the name of the project on the whiteboard?|Q|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn021|no problem.|S|Bns001
mn082|so that everybody|D|Bns001
mn082|uh i i will send also the pointer which miguel sent to me to everybody so that everybody can take a look to this uh project.|S|Bns001
mn081|i was|D|Bns001
mn082|and uh i don't know what information is available.|S|Bns001
mn082|because i didn't find the time currently to check it out.|S|Bns001
mn030|it's a project of the u.c.|S|Bns001
mn082|but first of|D|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn030|oh yeah.|S|Bns001
mn021|u.c. uh berkeley.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn081|when did you go through this?|Q|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn021|i'll i you uh i seen uh uh reports from nineteen uh ninety six ninety seven and ninety eight.|S|Bns001
mn081|because yesterday i was uh well coincidentally i bumped into this project here.|S|Bns001
mn021|maybe the project|D|Bns001
mn021|uh|F|Bns001
mn081|it's funny.|S|Bns001
mn082|uh sorry?|Q|Bns001
mn082|uh do|D|Bns001
mn081|yeah yesterday i was just surfing a little bit.|S|Bns001
mn082|uhhuh.|S|Bns001
mn082|uh.|S|Bns001
mn081|and then from nokia i came to this that project.|S|Bns001
mn082|uh.|S|Bns001
mn082|okay.|S|Bns001
mn082|i see.|S|Bns001
mn081|so|F|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn081|nokia research.|S|Bns001
mn021|i think that that the leader was uh professor katz.|S|Bns001
mn081|and then|D|Bns001
mn082|okay.|F|Bns001
mn081|that's right.|S|Bns001
mn081|and he's also board in nokia research.|S|Bns001
mn021|okay.|B|Bns001
mn081|so|F|Bns001
mn082|uhhuh.|S|Bns001
mn082|then the second thing is that uh daimler-chrysler research here in palo alto as well as in germany ulm is doing in principle the same with a car.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh.|S|Bns001
mn082|they have a specific antenna for uh g.s.m. oh g.p.s. and and for future extended g. uh g.s.m. networks and wireless lan and and other and other network technology.|S|Bns001
mn082|in the roof of the car they have a lot of servers.|S|Bns001
mn082|in the trunk of the car then they collect data how it is with handoff and all these kind of things.|S|Bns001
mn082|and they are driving around the different areas.|S|Bns001
mn082|and the same car exists here in palo alto uh based on wireless lan g.s.m. and 2x ricochet networks.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn082|they collect the collect collecting a lot of data concerning the seamless handoffs and whether it works very well with speed.|S|Bns001
mn082|and um|F|Bns001
mn082|uh thomas is going to build mobile i.p. stuff in their servers.|S|Bns001
mn082|uh|F|Bns001
mn082|because they want to|D|Bns001
mn082|so i think there is a lot of activities in the area.|S|Bns001
mn082|uh|F|Bns001
mn082|and my third uh comment is uh if we are going something in that direction that is quite different from this thing here.|S|Bns001
mn082|but anyway maybe as a core technology with a real product in mind.|S|Bns001
mn082|i see some difficulty because nobody currently has here certain kind uh of u.m.t.s. know how.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn082|and you need it definitely.|S|Bns001
mn082|because then it must be your uh bible i would like to say that you are very familiar with u.m.t.s. if you want to go in in that way.|S|Bns001
mn082|and as far as i know the u.m.t.s. standardization is not finished yet.|S|Bns001
mn082|ninety percent maybe or eighty percent.|S|Bns001
mn082|i i'm not sure.|S|Bns001
mn082|but uh|F|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn021|let me let me ask you a question about uh u.m.t.s. or or third or possible generation wireless communication systems.|S|Bns001
mn082|that|D|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn021|uh from the point of view of the user uh is there uh something more that nnn that than more speed?|Q|Bns001
mn021|is there any other advantage from the point of view of the user or of of the terminals?|Q|Bns001
mn082|users of of u.m.t. s?|Q|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|you can request certain kind of q.s.|S|Bns001
mn082|you can even request it in g.p.s.|S|Bns001
mn082|but it's not end to end quality of service.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B|Bns001
mn082|it is only um what the gateways get.|S|Bns001
mn021|okay.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|and within the core network there are certain kind of tunnels set up in the core network itself of the access provider.|S|Bns001
mn082|not the internet backbone core.|S|Bns001
mn082|and you use certain kind of tunnel mechanism to combine in principle the base station cluster control.|S|Bns001
mn082|but this is uh is controlled by a certain kind of node.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B|Bns001
mn082|and you have the gateway to the p.d.n. or the public data network.|S|Bns001
mn082|and between both there's a certain kind of tunnel set up.|S|Bns001
mn021|but in fact|D|Bns001
mn021|but in fact now at the g.s.m. level what you have is that every voice channel you use provides a a a pretty fine fixed uh data speed.|S|Bns001
mn021|so we can say that every voice channel has an an uh implied um quality of service.|S|Bns001
mn021|which is nnn ninety six hundred bits per second.|S|Bns001
mn021|full duplex.|S|Bns001
mn082|you mean now for g.s. m?|Q|Bns001
mn021|doesn't it?|Q|Bns001
mn082|or|D|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn021|so|F|Bns001
mn082|yeah what is what means quality of service.|S|Bns001
mn082|a certain degree.|S|Bns001
mn082|right?|Q|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|uh|F|Bns001
mn082|sometimes we have some|D|Bns001
mn021|no but um but not only because of of data speed.|S|Bns001
mn021|but also about delay.|S|Bns001
mn021|you know.|F|Bns001
mn021|because g.s.m. networks were developed to uh with a voice service in mind.|S|Bns001
mn021|uh delay is also considered in these networks.|S|Bns001
mn021|so|F|Bns001
mn021|uh in fact for every voice channel you have uh a pretty fine maximum uh delay and jitter and a a a specified um data speed.|S|Bns001
mn021|so you can scale up scale up this uh this um thing by using several channels.|S|Bns001
mn021|so in fact you have using just g.s.m. technology you have more or less the same building blocks as you can get uh with the u.m.t.s.|S|Bns001
mn021|i mean that one thing is that the technology is a little bit different.|S|Bns001
mn021|that uh the base station thing is different.|S|Bns001
mn021|and maybe uh the the internal routing uh inside the network is different.|S|Bns001
mn021|but from the point of view of the mobile things uh i'm not sure if if|D|Bns001
mn082|it's packaged data oriented.|S|Bns001
mn082|it's not really circuit switched.|S|Bns001
mn082|in u.m.t.s. you have always g.p.s. as a a involvement in the core network.|S|Bns001
mn082|you have in principle the path which still is available for for the g.s.m. network.|S|Bns001
mn082|also they use in principle the same uh the same mechanism.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn082|but you also have a uh packet oriented communication that's on the g.p.s. stuff.|S|Bns001
mn082|and that's also related to u.m.t.s.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah but the you know it is also being uh developed this g. uh p. d.p.r.s. thing g.p.r.s. thing.|S|Bns001
mn082|so|F|Bns001
mn082|that is|D|Bns001
mn021|which is uh uh packet data over g.s.m.|S|Bns001
mn021|so|F|Bns001
mn021|i mean uh i don't see that a a lot of difference.|S|Bns001
mn021|we can expect a lot of differences uh from the uh mobile terminal point of view uh when uh u.m.t.s. be deployed.|S|Bns001
mn021|what i'm trying to say is that is that well uh maybe uh it is not a big problem that any of us uh be uh um were um a u.m.t.s. expert.|S|Bns001
mn021|because uh i i don't see it i think that the u.m.t.s. thing is more a technology issue than a research issue.|S|Bns001
mn021|maybe i'm wrong.|S|Bns001
mn021|just|D|Bns001
mn021|um|F|Bns001
mn082|no i think there's a lot.|S|Bns001
mn021|explaining my|D|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|F|Bns001
mn082|i think there's a lot of research.|S|Bns001
mn082|but the question is is this uh a research in which direction we are going?|Q|Bns001
mn021|i mean to be done here.|S|Bns001
mn082|and because|D|Bns001
mn082|for|D|Bns001
mn021|not not at the|D|Bns001
mn021|of course you know i'm i i agree with you that there are a lot of things to be developed.|S|Bns001
mn021|but but the point is that uh this is probably not here.|S|Bns001
mn021|because uh well you know the the the orientation of our group which is uh networks services and applications not uh wireless technology or the underlying wireless technology.|S|Bns001
mn030|you think more about hardware technology.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn030|so there is a lot of hardware to develop but not|D|Bns001
mn021|you know radio frequency technology.|S|Bns001
mn021|wide band uh c.d.m.a.|S|Bns001
mn021|these kind of things all have a lot of things to be to be uh researched.|S|Bns001
mn021|but uh i don't think this is not something we are doing here.|S|Bns001
mn082|right.|S|Bns001
mn082|but bear in mind the picture is a is a little bit different.|S|Bns001
mn082|the picture i have in mind concerning u.m.t.s. is first of all if you use u.m.t.s. only for voice like you did it or are doing now for g.s.m. it's not worth to have this kind of network.|S|Bns001
mn082|and currently in europe where it will be deployed first i believe it will be very hard in principle to get some money back if you have only for using it for voice.|S|Bns001
mn021|voice.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|because they paid a lot of money.|S|Bns001
mn082|so|F|Bns001
mn082|what is the point?|Q|Bns001
mn082|the point is that you use the u.m.t.s. to connect to the internet and have certain kind of services which are still not available up to now.|S|Bns001
mn082|but the problem is if you have the internet content and you have maybe your small uh um device of maybe only evolution based for for these uh new technologies for for certain mobile phones then you have certain kind of problems.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B|Bns001
mn082|you know?|Q|Bns001
mn082|because you cannot use these things.|S|Bns001
mn082|and wap is not an answer for for these kind of things.|S|Bns001
mn082|you know?|Q|Bns001
mn082|so|F|Bns001
mn082|the i believe there is a lot of research work.|S|Bns001
mn082|and also if you see the end to end scope of the internet from the mobile node up to the certain kind of server correspondent node or whatever you call this destination then you have certain kind of models for instance for the quality of service and all these kind of things.|S|Bns001
mn082|and then is u.m.t.s. only one link where you have certain kind of subnet layer technology.|S|Bns001
mn082|and you have to match these things anyway.|S|Bns001
mn082|it's like a normal ethernet.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B|Bns001
mn082|whatever you see it is only an additional subnet layer technology.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|and you have all the things mapped to the uh to to the to the the internet stuff in principle to this technology.|S|Bns001
mn082|and furthermore you see that the trend is to put more i.p. technology really really i.p. technology and not certain kind of modifications and adaptations to their access network itself.|S|Bns001
mn082|and|F|Bns001
mn082|there's a lot of potential as i believe for for uh certain research work.|S|Bns001
mn082|but the question is first of all do we have the competence to do something like that?|Q|Bns001
mn082|first of all.|S|Bns001
mn082|second we are not hardware builders in that sense to set up certain kind of end systems.|S|Bns001
mn082|we can design them yeah from the protocol layering.|S|Bns001
mn082|and and maybe have some simulations or whatever.|S|Bns001
mn082|but isn't the final outcome really such a device?|Q|Bns001
mn082|prototype linux based.|S|Bns001
mn082|and we go around here and we have maybe a g.p.s. base station sponsored by ericsson.|S|Bns001
mn082|since they are living not so far away.|S|Bns001
mn082|and and maybe wavelan connection here.|S|Bns001
mn082|now a testbed.|S|Bns001
mn082|and then then figure out that it works?|Q|Bns001
mn082|so that's my point.|S|Bns001
mn081|well just to make the list a little bit longer.|S|Bns001
mn082|yep.|S|Bns001
mn081|um you could also think about uh session management.|S|Bns001
mn081|i do along with uh the network applications and services uh as you might know.|S|Bns001
mn081|it's a a|D|Bns001
mn081|if you can do it in the end systems or at specific servers then i'm in favor of that.|S|Bns001
mn081|but session management i mean uh the authentication if you go from one network to the other it's not solved.|S|Bns001
mn081|uh|F|Bns001
mn081|nobody really wants a a guest on your network.|S|Bns001
mn081|unless you get some money through some way uh through some way.|S|Bns001
mn081|then there is also the session management in the sense that a lot of these things at the barwan project as you said go through proxies.|S|Bns001
mn081|there might be kind of handoffs at uh at proxies.|S|Bns001
mn081|like the zip uh zip proxy that we also discussed before a little bit.|S|Bns001
mn081|that that's i think also in the line of uh session management.|S|Bns001
mn081|then there is this uh perfect thing uh the berkeley sockets.|S|Bns001
mn081|it's almost perfect.|S|Bns001
mn081|they kind of skipped uh layer five uh session management or session layer i think.|S|Bns001
mn081|that's um normally with if you do a socket programming it's directly the application protocol on layer four uh t.c.p. socket or layer five for u.d.p. socket.|S|Bns001
mn081|there might also be some research|D|Bns001
mn081|well.|F|Bns001
mn081|could you introduce such a session management?|Q|Bns001
mn081|or|F|Bns001
mn081|what they do right now is they make it part of the application level protocol.|S|Bns001
mn081|that's what they do most often.|S|Bns001
mn081|like with session management for mobile the uh applications such as instant messaging or uh talks and so on uh like zip it's just doing a a reconnect.|S|Bns001
mn081|if they think that the network is different or different capabilities come into play they simply do a reconnect.|S|Bns001
mn081|so it's part of the protocol.|S|Bns001
mn081|that's all what i think about session management.|S|Bns001
mn081|like part of in proxies or is it embedded in application level protocols.|S|Bns001
mn082|but it's really higher level.|S|Bns001
mn082|right?|Q|Bns001
mn082|it's no more related to a network.|S|Bns001
mn081|it's|D|Bns001
mn082|we are leaving the network area.|S|Bns001
mn082|that's dangerous.|S|Bns001
mn081|so how do you want to focus on network services.|S|Bns001
mn082|because if you go to the|D|Bns001
mn082|if you|D|Bns001
mn082|for me that's starting with middleware aspects.|S|Bns001
mn082|you know?|Q|Bns001
mn081|well|D|Bns001
mn082|and|D|Bns001
mn081|so network applications if you look at the name of the group one thing is that um they used to call a a a network that was uh if it was like distributed between two systems connected by a network.|S|Bns001
mn081|if you look at network from the o.z. layer then it's uh level two or something or maybe level three but everything below three.|S|Bns001
mn081|so there are i think two two different interpretations of uh network.|S|Bns001
mn082|no i believe network is if you see it really from from the i.p. protocol suite is then layer one in principle up including layer four.|S|Bns001
mn082|despite the fact that layer four is only residing normally in the end system and in the gateways.|S|Bns001
mn081|but are there network applications then?|Q|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn081|so the the name is network services and applications.|S|Bns001
mn081|so what could be an example of a network application if you look at the o.z. stick?|Q|Bns001
mn082|yeah we have i think some.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|do you see this word application related to a network?|Q|Bns001
mn082|or do you see this word independently?|Q|Bns001
mn082|that was never discussed in detail.|S|Bns001
mn082|network services and applications.|S|Bns001
mn082|so everything in the world.|S|Bns001
mn081|okay.|S|Bns001
mn082|or is the application related to the network?|Q|Bns001
mn082|for my understanding and as far as we discussed so such a long time uh these applications should.|S|Bns001
mn082|for instance ecommerce.|S|Bns001
mn081|okay okay well they will i didn't want to get a discussion now.|S|Bns001
mn082|and it's really really|D|Bns001
mn082|yeah|F|Bns001
mn082|you know?|Q|Bns001
mn082|that|D|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|no no uh that is a typical application i think.|S|Bns001
mn082|which is in principle also a little bit related to uh to the network.|S|Bns001
mn082|but not any application.|S|Bns001
mn082|and we also have the aspects for security.|S|Bns001
mn082|miguel you mentioned here authentication and and triple a..|S|Bns001
mn082|but we do not have any expert anymore.|S|Bns001
mn082|because hannes was an expert for that.|S|Bns001
mn082|so the problem for me it still exists that we have in principle here basic building blocks in the proposal from the networking side.|S|Bns001
mn082|we could have a certain kind of application.|S|Bns001
mn082|and there's a lot of activities in the outside world.|S|Bns001
mn082|and i believe there's a lot of contacts.|S|Bns001
mn082|or there could be a lot of contacts uh with with these people.|S|Bns001
mn082|especially at uh georgia tech.|S|Bns001
mn082|i know on next week on tuesday.|S|Bns001
mn082|tuesday right.|S|Bns001
mn082|we will go to u.c.b.|S|Bns001
mn082|there are three guys.|S|Bns001
mn082|then morgan mentioned one.|S|Bns001
mn082|i do not know exactly um uh what he is doing.|S|Bns001
mn082|but he's also interesting in some kind of collaboration.|S|Bns001
mn082|he's also a professor in the u.c.b.|S|Bns001
mn082|and uh many universities.|S|Bns001
mn082|maybe claudia mentioned duisburg.|S|Bns001
mn082|and uh in principle most of the university have some activities in that area.|S|Bns001
mn082|we will not take care about these one.|S|Bns001
mn082|but we can use them as um for field uh field trial access.|S|Bns001
mn082|and and and maybe some support.|S|Bns001
mn082|and and whatever kind of thing.|S|Bns001
mn082|and we focus really on the networking stuff.|S|Bns001
mn082|and going in more detail in this area.|S|Bns001
mn082|and the alternative is maybe what uh|D|Bns001
mn082|currently we have only uh this uh proposal from wilbert to go more in the smaller scope.|S|Bns001
mn082|figure out some potential from maybe this uh wavelan u.m.t.s. stuff.|S|Bns001
mn082|and and starting from that.|S|Bns001
mn082|or are there other suggestions?|Q|Bns001
mn030|i think we uh have already so much work put into this proposal.|S|Bns001
mn030|why to switch now?|Q|Bns001
mn030|so i don't see the reason for that.|S|Bns001
mn030|maybe the application we suggested is not the best one.|S|Bns001
mn030|so we have to think about an application which which is um um for mobile users more relevant.|S|Bns001
mn030|i don't know.|S|Bns001
mn030|maybe video games.|S|Bns001
mn030|if you are traveling|D|Bns001
mn030|uh it's boring to travel.|S|Bns001
mn030|and then you decide to play a video game with somebody else who's traveling.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah you know it's still mentioned in the proposal.|S|Bns001
mn030|so|F|Bns001
mn082|and|F|Bns001
mn082|um|D|Bns001
mn082|i i'm sure okay that it is the wrong place to get the foundation why we are use this kind of application.|S|Bns001
mn082|but uh and in in the end of the text in the end of the text of the proposal.|S|Bns001
mn082|but it is mentioned that it is only an example.|S|Bns001
mn082|and that we use this application in principle while it is then very very easy to get a certain kind of access to these kind of things.|S|Bns001
mn082|when you have a video game server and and you want to have mobile access you must at least have one in your consortium or as a partner whatever who provides this service.|S|Bns001
mn082|and then we we are playing videos in principle if you have a field trial.|S|Bns001
mn082|and that is i think much more harder than to have a certain kind of certain kind of access to the university.|S|Bns001
mn082|and uh to this server which is run on the campus of the university.|S|Bns001
mn030|okay that's right.|S|Bns001
mn082|and that is the point.|S|Bns001
mn082|you can have this to figure out all the things.|S|Bns001
mn082|and the the um|F|Bns001
mn082|and the the um|F|Bns001
mn082|um now how to say the requirements of this application using this classroom scenario.|S|Bns001
mn082|but nevertheless it's not the best for 3x.|S|Bns001
mn082|and and and and uh|F|Bns001
mn082|networking stuff.|S|Bns001
mn082|you are right.|S|Bns001
mn082|but it does anybody see certain kind of potential here to go on?|Q|Bns001
mn082|and to start the work maybe in this little bit smaller oh uh scope based on these building blocks.|S|Bns001
mn082|because multicast you still uh you mentioned that there is no potential.|S|Bns001
mn082|i think it's described here that the potential if you use it for the mapping to the next generation networks in the wireless access area they are still some potential to map multicast.|S|Bns001
mn082|because they do not use it.|S|Bns001
mn082|and to figure out whether they're useful instead of using certain kind of tunneling mechanism and to set up these tunnels|D|Bns001
mn082|and have the mapping between a p.s.d.n. uh telephone number or whatever kind of number they are using to i.p. addresses and then there's the tunnel i.d.'s|D|Bns001
mn082|and and all this kind of things i think is very beneficial as well for for telecommunication providers.|S|Bns001
mn082|as well as for i.s.p.'s.|S|Bns001
mn082|i i think the potential is still there.|S|Bns001
mn082|you you neglected that.|S|Bns001
mn082|but i don't think that you are right in that sense.|S|Bns001
mn081|well think it works.|S|Bns001
mn081|but uh|D|Bns001
mn081|yes the mapping of course between multicasting and the u.m.t.s. or or whatever.|S|Bns001
mn082|in next generation?|Q|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn081|that's or c.d.m.a. or whatever that's uh yeah probably a thing that has to be find out.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn081|i don't know what statuses.|S|Bns001
mn081|maybe they already did it as part of u.m.t.s.|S|Bns001
mn081|i'm not sure.|S|Bns001
mn081|i don't have a clue.|S|Bns001
mn081|i i only know how it works on copper and like ethernet.|S|Bns001
mn081|and on p.s.p.p.p. over something.|S|Bns001
mn081|and how it works like that.|S|Bns001
mn081|but on the wireless i'm not sure.|S|Bns001
mn082|now what do you see about the|D|Bns001
mn082|um um|F|Bns001
mn082|k.p.n. interests.|S|Bns001
mn082|because i believe if the argument changes as follows that you are here and that you are very familiar with uh the multicast stuff and k.p.n. is very interesting in u.m.t.s. stuff and this is one potential target network environment we are focusing on but only for the uh i.p. layer technology then why do the mapping of also potential mapping of multicast i think must be of major interest for them.|S|Bns001
mn082|right?|Q|Bns001
mn021|one question.|S|Bns001
mn081|yes but if if it's available|D|Bns001
mn081|that means|D|Bns001
mn081|so so if uh if it's already part of the u.m.t.s. standardization then uh it's immediately finished.|S|Bns001
mn081|like okay you can tell k.p.n. well go to ericsson or nokia and buy it.|S|Bns001
mn081|and if it's not in there yet well it could be a suggestion.|S|Bns001
mn081|and then the hardware people will make it part like the etsi or whatever where u. wherever u.m.t.s. is standardized they will well go for it.|S|Bns001
mn082|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn081|of course yeah this this group could do that too.|S|Bns001
mn081|could be.|S|Bns001
mn081|but|F|Bns001
mn021|i have a an important doubt about the i.p. availability over u.m.t.s.|S|Bns001
mn021|i mean you know that the carriers and some manufacturers have done an important effort in developing this web thing.|S|Bns001
mn021|and uh i'm not sure what they plan to do with next generation.|S|Bns001
mn021|i mean are they maintaining are they holding the same web technology?|Q|Bns001
mn021|or are just they discarding this technology?|Q|Bns001
mn021|and forgetting about the thing.|S|Bns001
mn021|i i don't know what will happen.|S|Bns001
mn021|uh i i don't have a clue.|S|Bns001
mn021|probably if after searching a little bit on the on the net i can get the answer.|S|Bns001
mn021|but initially this is something to to to have in mind.|S|Bns001
mn021|i mean because maybe this u.m.t.s. thing will appear on the market without i.p. as a native protocol.|S|Bns001
mn021|and if this is the case well thus seamless integration could be strongly affected.|S|Bns001
mn021|at least uh if you we want to use u.m.t.s.|S|Bns001
mn021|i'm i'm just uh throwing the question.|S|Bns001
mn021|uh i mean looking for an answer.|S|Bns001
mn021|because i don't know if uh some of you have a clue about this.|S|Bns001
mn021|i don't know what what carriers are planning to do about this.|S|Bns001
mn081|i'm not really sure.|S|Bns001
mn081|but i thought i i had the impression that we can throw away our nokia stuff when our web gateways when we even go to g.p.r.s.|S|Bns001
mn081|so|F|Bns001
mn081|let alone u.m.t.s.|S|Bns001
mn082|now wap is ja not only related now to available bandwidth.|S|Bns001
mn081|that's the impression i get.|S|Bns001
mn082|that's not the only thing.|S|Bns001
mn082|it's only the adaptation towards the capabilities of the end device.|S|Bns001
mn082|right?|Q|Bns001
mn081|yeah definitely.|S|Bns001
mn082|so|F|Bns001
mn082|uh i never was a friend|D|Bns001
mn081|but but still a it's a it's a fundamental|D|Bns001
mn082|huh.|D|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn081|uh it's a part of a of design like the the|D|Bns001
mn081|the terminal has a wap stick.|S|Bns001
mn081|and there's a box that has also a a wap stick.|S|Bns001
mn082|so yeah.|D|Bns001
mn081|and they do sometime most cases they do share an i.p. address.|S|Bns001
mn081|but doesn't uh have to deal with i.p. at all.|S|Bns001
mn081|it's just a thirty bit number.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn081|that actually is an assigned number.|S|Bns001
mn081|but it's all only used for identification.|S|Bns001
mn081|that's the only thing.|S|Bns001
mn081|it's stored in a wap cookie.|S|Bns001
mn081|much like h.t.p.|S|Bns001
mn081|in a cookie and from the wap gateway|D|Bns001
mn081|then it will be h.t.p. real h.t.p. or something.|S|Bns001
mn081|so it's it's really a different uh type of connection.|S|Bns001
mn081|it looks a little bit like uh the the well w.m.l. looks a little bit like h.t.m.l.|S|Bns001
mn081|but that's all what's uh|D|Bns001
mn081|it's not i.p. at all.|S|Bns001
mn082|right.|B|Bns001
mn081|because there is a gateway you can access with almost the same microbrowser.|S|Bns001
mn081|the same uh web servers.|S|Bns001
mn081|if they provide the right content uh spit out the right uh w.m.l. language.|S|Bns001
mn081|so it's it's really a different network technology i think.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|it's transparent in principle what you can carry.|S|Bns001
mn082|but|F|Bns001
mn082|anyway you have the gateway.|S|Bns001
mn082|it must be uh the uh uh conversion of the media.|S|Bns001
mn081|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn081|but|D|Bns001
mn082|of the contents in principle.|S|Bns001
mn082|but i don't see that uh|D|Bns001
mn082|it's too late i believe.|S|Bns001
mn082|if wap was available in the beginning of g.s.m. then i think it was there would be a good chance that it is well deployed.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn082|but now the first generation of web-browsers are in the and and uh i would say handies.|S|Bns001
mn082|so that's wrong in the mobile phones.|S|Bns001
mn082|but the the next generation of networks are still available.|S|Bns001
mn082|and the uh the bandwidth constraints are no more applicable.|S|Bns001
mn081|well|F|Bns001
mn081|right now there is still a lot of wap actually.|S|Bns001
mn082|and|D|Bns001
mn081|so that the|D|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn082|yeah but the hype.|S|Bns001
mn082|but|D|Bns001
mn082|pffft|D|Bns001
mn082|uh|F|Bns001
mn081|well users usage.|S|Bns001
mn082|i never saw a user using wap.|S|Bns001
mn082|please raise your hand who is using wap.|S|Bns001
mn081|my colleagues are.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah?|Q|Bns001
mn081|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn081|yeah they are using wap.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah?|Q|Bns001
mn082|okay one of six.|S|Bns001
mn082|so|F|Bns001
mn030|i don't have a mobile phone.|S|Bns001
mn081|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|oh.|S|Bns001
mn035|who is using mobile phones?|Q|Bns001
mn081|well you don't have a mobile phone in in the u.s.a. here.|S|Bns001
mn021|no.|S|Bns001
mn021|no.|S|Bns001
mn081|so that's maybe the reason.|S|Bns001
mn021|not me.|S|Bns001
mn081|and i'm not i doubt that it's not available in germany.|S|Bns001
mn081|it's would be unbelievable to me.|S|Bns001
mn082|now do you yeah do you see the chance for wap?|Q|Bns001
mn082|i don't see it.|S|Bns001
mn081|it it is.|S|Bns001
mn081|in in in sweden it is also there.|S|Bns001
mn081|and in the netherlands it is also available.|S|Bns001
mn021|huh.|B|Bns001
mn081|every provider provides|D|Bns001
mn021|in spain it's available.|S|Bns001
mn021|but uh you know uh my main complaint has been all the time that it is difficult to me to believe that i can do interesting work with a 4 lines display.|S|Bns001
mn021|uh maybe check the lottery result or something like this.|S|Bns001
mn081|oh.|S|Bns001
mn081|yeah but|D|Bns001
mn081|oh!|S|Bns001
mn081|i'm the first one to admit that's a that it is a hype.|S|Bns001
mn021|but|F|Bns001
mn081|but and but i'm i just wanted to say it is being used.|S|Bns001
mn081|but if it makes sense to me and to especially to have wap in in between no.|S|Bns001
mn081|i'm not a supporter of it.|S|Bns001
mn021|huh huh-huh.|B|Bns001
mn081|so they have this optimized protocol to to transmit a few ascii bytes that can refresh the screen with a different animation every well second a few times.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn081|so that's that's true.|S|Bns001
mn081|i immediately agree.|S|Bns001
mn081|but the thing was you just asked well will will it be the same will there be wap for u.m.t.s. and so on q.p.r.s.|S|Bns001
mn021|well|D|Bns001
mn081|and well i don't have the answer.|S|Bns001
mn021|i i don't know what will|D|Bns001
mn081|but i thought it was not.|S|Bns001
mn081|i'm just it's weird it's weird to stop doing it with g.p.r.s.|S|Bns001
mn035|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B|Bns001
mn035|but usually wap shouldn't is so general that it can be used with u.m.t.s.|S|Bns001
mn035|so if you still want to use wap with u.m.t.s. you might be able to do it.|S|Bns001
mn035|but|D|Bns001
mn081|yes.|S|Bns001
mn035|that shouldn't be your only way of|D|Bns001
mn082|there's a you can put the gateway.|S|Bns001
mn081|if you want to do it in a in a mobile phone want to implement it as a light stack or something.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|D|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|D|Bns001
mn081|yes?|Q|Bns001
mn082|yep.|S|Bns001
mn081|sure.|S|Bns001
mn035|but usually that's not the reason to have u.m.t.s.|S|Bns001
mn081|no not not if you have a big uh web pad or something.|S|Bns001
mn035|yep.|S|Bns001
mn081|then you there there's an i.p. stack in it.|S|Bns001
mn082|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn081|and|F|Bns001
mn082|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn082|so maybe i would like to ask claudia|D|Bns001
mn081|huh.|B|Bns001
mn082|you read the proposal in the meantime?|Q|Bns001
fn083|yeah but the task changed really a lot.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|S|Bns001
fn083|so i'd i rather would like to|D|Bns001
mn082|yes that's right.|S|Bns001
mn082|and do you have some comments on it?|Q|Bns001
mn082|from the next this is version zero dot five right yeah.|S|Bns001
fn083|yeah but i'd rather like to follow the discussion before i gave any comments.|S|Bns001
fn083|because it's really the first point is it's much more than it was before i left.|S|Bns001
fn083|so it's like five weeks in between so it's like that whew.|S|Bns001
fn083|that big now.|S|Bns001
mn082|that's right.|S|Bns001
fn083|and it really changed a lot.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
fn083|because the i mean i found the classroom inside.|S|Bns001
fn083|but the thing where i left the discussion was that we are talking about uh a classroom where you know everybody could look on with any kind of device and follow lectures or do exercise or whatever.|S|Bns001
fn083|so|F|Bns001
fn083|now we are talking about something which is much more precise.|S|Bns001
fn083|and the the range of stuff is maybe more narrow than before.|S|Bns001
fn083|so i'd rather like to to follow it a bit and then to get more into the ideas.|S|Bns001
mn082|okay.|S|Bns001
mn081|can i do another one like|D|Bns001
mn081|u.m.t.s. or wireless generally are will be more expensive.|S|Bns001
mn081|and especially u.m.t.s.|S|Bns001
mn081|if they want to get back the money.|S|Bns001
mn081|so is it maybe a research topic to focus on the|D|Bns001
mn081|not really billing of course.|S|Bns001
mn081|i wouldn't|D|Bns001
mn081|but at least the different application of protocol based usage.|S|Bns001
mn081|so you have uh one connection one application uses f.t.p. whatever.|S|Bns001
mn081|bit voice or some other|D|Bns001
mn081|that those type of application you may might want to make more out of a megabit per second or something.|S|Bns001
mn081|could that be something?|Q|Bns001
mn081|or|D|Bns001
mn082|also we want to go more in the triple a. area right?|S|Bns001
mn082|because billing alone|D|Bns001
mn081|or is|D|Bns001
mn081|no well it's|D|Bns001
mn082|or or um billing is related to accounting.|S|Bns001
mn082|accounting is related to authentification and authorization.|S|Bns001
mn081|yeah that's true.|S|Bns001
mn082|so|F|Bns001
mn082|and then you are still at the triple a. service uh activity.|S|Bns001
mn081|yeah that's right.|S|Bns001
mn082|and nobody is has the skills to deal with that.|S|Bns001
mn082|and then we are leaving our scope anyway.|S|Bns001
mn081|okay.|S|Bns001
mn035|my impression on this proposal is that every single block has some research done already.|S|Bns001
mn035|so multicast this means that there are many things done.|S|Bns001
mn035|oh what was it?|Q|Bns001
mn035|maybe i was routing mobility management.|S|Bns001
mn035|but no one actually put them together.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah that's|D|Bns001
mn035|but so that's the big problem.|S|Bns001
mn082|that is a|D|Bns001
mn035|but the problem with this problem might be that it's too big.|S|Bns001
mn035|to put all these big pieces to|D|Bns001
fn083|what do you mean by put together?|Q|Bns001
mn035|so that you really have a complete a complete scenario.|S|Bns001
mn082|as it what i mean the synergy effect right?|S|Bns001
mn082|from from|D|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn035|you have in one scenario multicast quality of service routing and mobile um networking.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
fn083|uh.|B|Bns001
fn083|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn035|not just the islands alone.|S|Bns001
fn083|so why i wasn't|D|Bns001
fn083|well yeah uh hold myself back a bit with comments is uh because when i left the discussion the discussion was what to to have something like a big umbrella about everybody who was at this point here.|S|Bns001
fn083|and so the discussion was much broader than it is maybe right now.|S|Bns001
fn083|and there i had the impression the umbrella was this kind of classroom thing.|S|Bns001
fn083|right?|Q|Bns001
fn083|or wrong?|Q|Bns001
mn082|yeah in principle it is related to the current state.|S|Bns001
mn082|but the networking stuff is more explained in much more detail.|S|Bns001
fn083|yeah yeah yeah it is.|S|Bns001
fn083|of course.|S|Bns001
mn082|and the work packages are better oder what could be derived for work packages is much better aligned.|S|Bns001
fn083|yeah.|B|Bns001
fn083|yeah yeah yeah.|S|Bns001
fn083|that's that's clear.|S|Bns001
mn082|but that has not changed yeah?|S|Bns001
fn083|yeah that's that's clear.|S|Bns001
fn083|but then i don't get|D|Bns001
fn083|because when we were discussion discussing this uh stuff weeks ago uh i had the impression that you know everything of these work packages uh fit together under this one big umbrella.|S|Bns001
fn083|and now it sounds different.|S|Bns001
fn083|so that's what i don't understand.|S|Bns001
fn083|uh but it's also because i missed the last four weeks.|S|Bns001
fn083|so|F|Bns001
mn082|yeah the problem is if you|D|Bns001
fn083|it's a a bit hard for me to follow the development what happened in the last four weeks.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah okay maybe one sentence one sentence.|S|Bns001
fn083|why it changed so.|S|Bns001
mn082|if you're focussing on the argument chain as follows i have an application.|S|Bns001
mn082|this application has certain kind of requirements.|S|Bns001
mn082|these requirements are maybe multicast and and and quality of service and mobility.|S|Bns001
mn082|access and then mobility management.|S|Bns001
mn082|and that is it.|S|Bns001
mn082|i want to focus on it.|S|Bns001
mn082|then you have in mind that or you must have in mind that all other applications and all other networking stuff is not affected by this.|S|Bns001
mn082|that you can use it with every application.|S|Bns001
mn082|and if you introduce some new mechanism in the network that is not related only to interactive multimedia applications like the classroom it must be fit end to end.|S|Bns001
mn082|and if you assume something like we discussed it very hard with with multicast that you assume that multicast will be available at certain portions of the network or if you if you want to have it end to end this mechanism must be applied really for all throughout of the internet.|S|Bns001
mn082|otherwise it makes no sense.|S|Bns001
mn082|and we come to the conclusion okay uh multicast we must deal with both approaches.|S|Bns001
mn082|that you have uh application layer multicast.|S|Bns001
mn082|as well as maybe some other multicast and maybe really multicast.|D|Bns001
mn082|and then the point is how to select these mechanism if you want to have not a certain kind of access to the server elsewhere in the network you want to use any application.|S|Bns001
fn083|so if i understand i it right what has changed is before we were focussing on|D|Bns001
mn082|yeah?|Q|Bns001
mn082|and|D|Bns001
fn083|so because what's difficult for me is what is meant by application.|S|Bns001
fn083|so because i have sometimes the impression that everybody is defining application in different way.|S|Bns001
fn083|so what exactly is mean by application?|Q|Bns001
mn082|the application for instance here that uh the interactive classroom.|S|Bns001
mn082|but elsewhere any application in in in any kind of video audio.|S|Bns001
fn083|yeah.|S|Bns001
fn083|oh okay.|S|Bns001
fn083|so what has changed|D|Bns001
mn082|or whatever kind of game server.|S|Bns001
mn082|what kind of interactive multimedia especially uh downstreaming applications maybe uh video on demand then uh whatever kind of application you can consider.|S|Bns001
fn083|so what has changed is that we're not only focussing on this intelligent classroom but on everything.|S|Bns001
mn082|not on everything.|S|Bns001
mn082|that's not true.|S|Bns001
mn082|but we|D|Bns001
mn082|that's why we say here that we have a certain kind of uh possibility to change in the access networks.|S|Bns001
fn083|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn082|that means the wireless networks.|S|Bns001
mn082|because that provides in principle the mobility.|S|Bns001
mn082|and these|D|Bns001
mn082|and you see that there's a trend to provide i.p. functionality more and more in these kind of networks.|S|Bns001
mn082|but the problem is that you could not focus on this kind of um technology only for the access network.|S|Bns001
mn082|you have to have in mind always the end to end scope.|S|Bns001
mn082|and if you see for instance we have routing algorithm but different protocols and whatever kinds of things|D|Bns001
mn082|especially also for multicast.|S|Bns001
mn082|different things really for different providers.|S|Bns001
mn082|and uh and it's uh very easy to change it maybe in the access network for novel things.|S|Bns001
mn082|for instance that's one provider domain.|S|Bns001
mn082|and you can say well why not use active routing in that provider domain.|S|Bns001
mn082|so it means that packet are delivering information.|S|Bns001
mn082|and you do not have the separation of routing and and and forwarding process.|S|Bns001
mn082|it's impossible to deal with that in the whole internet.|S|Bns001
mn082|because security reasons and whatever kinds of things make it impossible.|S|Bns001
mn082|so how to combine these uh potential um extensions in the um access networks and|D|Bns001
mn082|without losing the end to end scope in the internet.|S|Bns001
mn082|then you can have certain novel features.|S|Bns001
mn082|give the providers like k.p.n. or whatever the the potential in principle to to uh see the building blocks for the future networks.|S|Bns001
mn082|because there's a three third generation like u.m.t.s.a. fourth generation more i.p. related.|S|Bns001
mn082|there will be a fifth generation i'm sure.|S|Bns001
mn082|and then you derive the certain kind of building blocks for this network.|S|Bns001
mn082|if you ever really full i uh uh full i.p. end to end.|S|Bns001
mn082|but nevertheless you can only not only focus on okay i provide this mechanism.|S|Bns001
mn082|because you are accessing a certain kind of server node in the internet using any application.|S|Bns001
mn082|and then this mechanism must fit it there.|S|Bns001
mn082|but nevertheless uh internet backbone is in the meantime based on its success.|S|Bns001
mn082|impossible to change.|S|Bns001
mn082|you see the difficulties with i.p. version six.|S|Bns001
mn082|uh uh you see the difficulties with multicast.|S|Bns001
mn082|they are discussed since you know ten years or whatever.|S|Bns001
mn082|the specification are rather stable and and available.|S|Bns001
mn082|but we have only islands in that.|S|Bns001
mn082|we cannot assume that everything is end to end available.|S|Bns001
mn082|and so you have to to have to have in mind that certain kinds of mechanisms are maybe at a certain stage end to end available.|S|Bns001
mn082|maybe we have a lucky that the islands are connected to each other.|S|Bns001
mn082|or the same applies for m.p.l.s. for instance.|S|Bns001
mn082|maybe they are only portions available.|S|Bns001
mn082|how to deal with that when the islands are not available?|Q|Bns001
mn082|and maybe nothing is available.|S|Bns001
mn082|but you have to select it.|S|Bns001
mn082|because i have a mobile phone a mobile node or whatever kind of device.|S|Bns001
mn082|and i want to contact a certain kind of content in the internet.|S|Bns001
mn082|so is it possible to have certain kind of normal features in the access network without losing the end to end scope of with these difficulties we are dealing with.|S|Bns001
mn082|i always say that the success of internet make it unflexible.|S|Bns001
mn082|it's impossible to change something very easy.|S|Bns001
mn082|it's easy maybe more on the access network as in the internet backbone.|S|Bns001
mn082|so that is uh overall picture that we have in mind with these things.|S|Bns001
mn082|and we can not|D|Bns001
mn082|we we are six people.|S|Bns001
mn082|or seven or whatever.|S|Bns001
mn082|if hannes come.|S|Bns001
mn082|we are not able to solve the problems uh in in uh in the few years or whatever.|S|Bns001
mn082|what the whole internet community has um done in in since uh since a decade.|S|Bns001
mn082|but we can pick up some some um potential and and and to start with something.|S|Bns001
mn082|and that's my missing point.|S|Bns001
mn082|that we have here in principle really the description of this problem i mentioned.|S|Bns001
mn082|and focus really on the reasonable size of the project.|S|Bns001
mn082|maybe in the first stage for the n.s.a. core itself.|S|Bns001
mn082|and maybe possible extension from for instance if k.p.n. say yes that's great.|S|Bns001
mn082|that's the right direction.|S|Bns001
mn082|we will support that.|S|Bns001
mn082|and if siemens say okay great we will support it.|S|Bns001
mn082|and and what it|D|Bns001
mn082|huh university of berlin or something.|S|Bns001
mn082|and maybe university of mannheim or duisburg.|S|Bns001
mn082|or in spain oder whatever.|S|Bns001
mn082|so if we have all the similar project then you have only to take care about that's a little bit aligned.|S|Bns001
mn082|that there's some transparency concerning the results.|S|Bns001
mn082|and and the activities are literally going in the in the same um pace.|S|Bns001
mn082|so that's the basic idea.|S|Bns001
mn082|but really it's to to figure out certain kind of smaller activities where we can start it.|S|Bns001
mn082|that's the point.|S|Bns001
mn082|and if we get some funding back|D|Bns001
mn082|and we have certain uh potential partners in the boat|D|Bns001
mn082|okay we can go to a broader scope of this whole thing yeah.|S|Bns001
mn021|let me let me propose a a a a reasoning way.|S|Bns001
mn021|uh let's assume that we are successful with this proposal.|S|Bns001
mn021|so we get the funding to do whatever what we want to do.|S|Bns001
mn021|so my question is what we want to do is|D|Bns001
mn021|let's assume that we have the funding.|S|Bns001
mn021|what will be our first and or or and second steps?|Q|Bns001
mn021|uh what kind of things uh we uh we will buy?|Q|Bns001
mn021|what kind of things we will uh program or we will deploy?|Q|Bns001
mn021|because answering this these questions we can know much better what the application we want.|S|Bns001
mn021|so let's assume|D|Bns001
mn082|yeah but the problem is that funding is the second step.|S|Bns001
mn081|huh.|B|Bns001
mn081|well i'm not sure.|S|Bns001
mn081|i i i think i agree with him.|S|Bns001
mn081|but uh right now we're looking at a you want to do a big thing instead of a great thing.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn081|so if you assume that it should connect uh really good to siemens and to uh k.p.n. and to the then it starts to get big we should all go to the in the same direction.|S|Bns001
mn081|if you already assume well okay they paid money and now you think okay what what great thing you want to do then it gives you more freedom to think about this great thing you want to do.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah but we have no uh current no public funding.|S|Bns001
mn081|no.|S|Bns001
mn082|okay everybody's paid here.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn035|yeah but but|D|Bns001
mn081|but you but you don't get one if you if you try to to align k.p.n. with siemens for instance.|S|Bns001
fn083|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn035|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn035|but|D|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn035|but for theoretical or for historical reasons a really good question if we would have the money what would we do with that.|S|Bns001
mn081|uh|D|Bns001
mn035|so if we don't know what we would like to do with the money we probably wouldn't get any money to do what we don't know.|S|Bns001
mn082|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn082|that's right.|S|Bns001
mn021|absolutely.|S|Bns001
mn082|that's right.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn035|so that's why i think yeah it's a good question.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|now that's the point why i am focussing on more on the|D|Bns001
mn035|yep.|B|Bns001
mn082|yeah|F|Bns001
mn082|i want to have really the activities.|S|Bns001
mn082|you know what is really the outcome?|S|Bns001
mn082|what is really the problem we are going to solve?|Q|Bns001
mn082|these are my questions.|S|Bns001
mn082|and if we have identified this block then it is possible to raise some money.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn035|that's just the same question just other way around.|S|Bns001
mn021|let let me put an example.|S|Bns001
mn021|you know i some days ago i bought like some of you this kind of things.|S|Bns001
mn021|this is a p.d.a.|S|Bns001
mn021|uh three com uh palm pilot compatible.|S|Bns001
mn035|modernistic stuff.|S|Bns001
mn021|nothing nothing that great.|S|Bns001
mn035|completely useless.|S|Bns001
mn021|but it has some some possibility of being expanded.|S|Bns001
mn021|but the point is uh the only in here the only thing wireless thing i can put on on this is just uh this omnisky modem.|S|Bns001
mn021|which is uh i think it is a subscription based uh thing.|S|Bns001
mn021|you have to pay every every month.|S|Bns001
mn021|and uh of course i cannot imagine that uh tomorrow i'll be able to buy a different thing with four different networks.|S|Bns001
mn021|four different providers on it.|S|Bns001
mn021|maybe i'm wrong.|S|Bns001
mn021|but|D|Bns001
mn021|if i have the funding i say okay well i can buy this or even i can buy a mobile computer.|S|Bns001
mn021|a notebook.|S|Bns001
mn021|okay?|Q|Bns001
mn021|a lot more expensive.|S|Bns001
mn021|but that's okay.|S|Bns001
mn021|i have the funding.|S|Bns001
mn021|then i can add a couple of cards at most.|S|Bns001
mn021|because huh the majority of the of the notebooks only have two p.c. cards uh type two slots.|S|Bns001
mn021|so|F|Bns001
mn021|in in the better case maybe i'm only able to add two different networks to this thing.|S|Bns001
mn021|so uh|F|Bns001
mn021|the difficulty i see is that uh if we are if you want to think in in two three four different technologies um maybe we are uh too advanced too um let's say uh too in advance for the current technology.|S|Bns001
mn021|which is not bad.|S|Bns001
mn021|but uh i'm just saying that it will be able it will|D|Bns001
mn021|sorry.|S|Bns001
mn021|it will be difficult for us to develop a a reasonable test bed with the available technology.|S|Bns001
mn021|if somebody tell us okay now here you have the thing and just put these four networks you want on the thing how can i do it now?|Q|Bns001
mn021|so huh|F|Bns001
mn021|i'm still trying to you know to get used to the uh all the ideas.|S|Bns001
mn021|and to see that all the things are really connecting.|S|Bns001
mn021|because this the uh most difficult thing i see to to to get this alignment to this connection point among the different things we are trying to align.|S|Bns001
mn021|so that's why i was proposing this this question.|S|Bns001
mn021|let's assume we have the funding.|S|Bns001
mn021|now let's proceed.|S|Bns001
mn021|what what kind of things we can buy we can put together we can program?|Q|Bns001
mn021|because oh at the end uh somebody will uh be asking us okay did you do your homework.|S|Bns001
mn021|did you do what you|D|Bns001
mn021|so|F|Bns001
mn082|it's clear.|S|Bns001
mn082|now from my point of view in the beginning one more time if i see the four building blocks and uh i could speak only for my skills i believe to derive a certain kind of q.s. reservation in advance scheme much more uh general as it is done for for u.s.a.i.a.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn082|but mapped then really to desired network subnet layer technologies.|S|Bns001
mn021|but for different networks?|Q|Bns001
mn082|yes.|S|Bns001
mn021|the point is for|D|Bns001
mn082|for|D|Bns001
mn082|no for u.m.t.s.|S|Bns001
mn082|but first of all a generic system.|S|Bns001
mn082|but because you can have several mechanism.|S|Bns001
mn082|really using certain kind of of um um quantitative description.|S|Bns001
mn082|you can have more of a qualitative description.|S|Bns001
mn082|you can have taken into account moving patterns.|S|Bns001
mn082|and and and whatever kind of things.|S|Bns001
mn082|but there are a lot of lot of ways to have certain kind of q.s. reservation in advance.|S|Bns001
mn082|and i see it as definitely is necessary to have this one.|S|Bns001
mn082|if i want be mobile and i want to have not a interruption of my in my application qualities of service.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B|Bns001
mn082|so|F|Bns001
mn082|um|F|Bns001
mn082|but then to go for instance to u.m.t.s. and figure out what is available within u.m.t.s.|S|Bns001
mn082|and if i really have an i.p. application where i need this kind of of quality of service and having in mind that certain kind of q.s. will be available in the rest of the internet|D|Bns001
mn082|so how can i map these things uh to the u.m.t.s. stuff?|Q|Bns001
mn082|and what is the trend towards u.m.t.s. to the first generation?|Q|Bns001
mn082|and how it is possible to map this one to this technology?|Q|Bns001
mn082|and if you have the building blocks identified what is really necessary for q.s. uh q.s. in advance for for mobile systems then you have in principle the ideas for the following generation what you could improve.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn082|because then you are maybe no more related to this kind of thing.|S|Bns001
mn082|i believe the same applies for multicast.|S|Bns001
mn082|and i believe the same applies for routing.|S|Bns001
mn082|so in principle in the beginning there would be a certain kind of uh paperwork anyway.|S|Bns001
mn082|some theoretical examination of these problems.|S|Bns001
mn021|i think so.|S|Bns001
mn082|and then some prototypes must be derived from that.|S|Bns001
mn082|and then maybe we will start here with a certain kind of uh testbed equipment we still have here.|S|Bns001
mn082|we have four uh p.c.'s available.|S|Bns001
mn082|maybe we have to extend it then.|S|Bns001
mn082|and figure out some real scenarios.|S|Bns001
mn082|and maybe then pfff.|S|Bns001
mn021|oh yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|because uh despite the|D|Bns001
mn082|uh uh hopefully then we have with the money also not uh only for the room.|S|Bns001
mn082|that would be great.|S|Bns001
mn082|but there are also some sponsors then then then we add a certain kind of field trial.|S|Bns001
mn082|but i think that's pfff that's years you know.|S|Bns001
mn021|a long way yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|that's years.|S|Bns001
mn021|that's right.|S|Bns001
mn082|but in the beginning we must have a certain kind of theoretical framework with the relevant technology.|S|Bns001
mn082|real technology.|S|Bns001
mn082|maybe you can start with g.p.s. or or u.m.t.s. or whatever.|S|Bns001
mn082|because these technology will definitely available in europe.|S|Bns001
mn082|there's some money spent on it.|S|Bns001
mn082|so that it will be in a certain kind of flavor.|S|Bns001
mn082|it will be available.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B|Bns001
mn082|and it will be also available in the u.s.a.|S|Bns001
mn082|because there is a big uh harmonization effort.|S|Bns001
mn082|despite the fact they are not aligned to each other anyway.|S|Bns001
mn082|but they will have also certain kind of third generation and fourth generation networks.|S|Bns001
mn082|so|F|Bns001
mn082|and after this theoretical framework if this one is aligned okay you have some specification.|S|Bns001
mn082|and you set up some linux or free b.s.d. or whatever kind of prototype.|S|Bns001
mn082|so that is what i have in mind with that.|S|Bns001
mn082|and then okay and then you will see.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn082|the problem is which i see is that it could be fruitful to standardization.|S|Bns001
mn082|that it could be fruitful to some extent to telecommunication providers.|S|Bns001
mn082|but there's not a real product like you say.|S|Bns001
mn082|there's not the selling idea behind it.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B|Bns001
mn082|yeah?|Q|Bns001
mn082|if you go with something what what wilbert mentioned okay let's have this one here we have a new p.c.m.c.i.a. card and and extend something and the end system or what you mentioned here was the seamless four technologies inter working in the end then you have an an a device which you can sell.|S|Bns001
mn082|if you go for a networking pfff um uh improvements in principle and and understanding next generation building blocks uh there's no product.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn082|but it is a long term it's long term i think uh work you can do.|S|Bns001
mn082|and it's more related i believe to the skills.|S|Bns001
mn082|to what is available.|S|Bns001
mn082|and and currently as i see what uh will be available within the n.s.a. group.|S|Bns001
mn021|okay.|S|Bns001
mn082|and uh the point is if we focus on on this networking small more networking stuff and them some application guys came into the boat and they focus on their application stuff whatever this means it might be we have then the active classroom.|S|Bns001
mn082|but it could be another one.|S|Bns001
mn082|that is not representative.|S|Bns001
fn083|yeah but there's something needed to sell it.|S|Bns001
mn082|it's only|D|Bns001
mn082|huh?|Q|Bns001
fn083|and i think|D|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|then then is something available.|S|Bns001
mn082|but i don't know.|S|Bns001
mn082|you know i'm not an application expert.|S|Bns001
mn082|i|D|Bns001
mn082|we have some content.|S|Bns001
mn082|we will then discuss it on next tuesday as i mentioned.|S|Bns001
mn021|bless you.|S|Bns001
fn083|bless you.|S|Bns001
mn082|uh anyway but uh that were is my answer to the question if some money is available.|S|Bns001
mn082|the good thing is that the money is available.|S|Bns001
mn082|because everybody is paid here.|S|Bns001
mn082|so that is money that the the smallest portion of money which is available.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B|Bns001
mn082|but first of all wilbert need more definitely.|S|Bns001
mn082|because maybe then k.p.n. is uh no more interesting to go on with this work.|S|Bns001
mn082|or we can convince with these kind of things which we have in mind.|S|Bns001
mn082|uh companies like k.p.n.|S|Bns001
mn082|so|F|Bns001
mn082|and if we have other suggestions and uh have this as a long term|D|Bns001
mn082|n.s.a. core group activity.|S|Bns001
mn082|and this theoretical framework whether it is finished in half a year or one year doesn't matter in principle.|S|Bns001
mn082|because the road map for the the next generation networks is is uh is for many years.|S|Bns001
mn082|and before u.m.t.s. will be deployed very well i believe uh it will be common uh two thousand four or something like that.|S|Bns001
mn082|so|F|Bns001
mn082|and and have an intermediate project which is related in this direction something like the seamless handover for two technologies or whatever.|S|Bns001
mn082|this is a smaller portion in the more generic framework i would like to say from this proposal.|S|Bns001
mn082|why not go in this way?|Q|Bns001
mn021|okay.|S|Bns001
mn082|i i don't know.|S|Bns001
mn082|but uh that's the point uh we are sitting here together.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn021|but|D|Bns001
mn082|but for for dietmar i think uh uh he mentioned it to me it's very clear that he will go on with a portion of time with this u.s.a.i.a. stuff.|S|Bns001
mn030|that's right.|S|Bns001
mn030|it depends on my|D|Bns001
mn082|in the matical sense.|S|Bns001
mn082|because that means for you in a certain kind a certain extent you are decoupled from networking stuff.|S|Bns001
mn082|because your focusing on the mathematical thing of whether it's a network or other thing.|S|Bns001
mn030|well i'm|D|Bns001
mn082|it doesn't matter.|S|Bns001
mn030|i'm focused on performance evaluation.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn030|and um especially of communication networks.|S|Bns001
mn030|and|F|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn030|i never uh um dealed with um mobile communications.|S|Bns001
mn030|so why not?|Q|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|so|F|Bns001
mn030|so that's uh to open my mind.|S|Bns001
mn082|there is it still ongoing activity with uh maybe a portion of time at the university of berlin berlin.|S|Bns001
mn082|and independently whether i will leave the uh uh i.c.s.i. in in the mid of december or not i will still focus on on on these q.s. in advance schemes.|S|Bns001
mn082|uh also within siemens.|S|Bns001
mn082|and also with some project there.|S|Bns001
mn082|and i believe your routing stuff is also available.|S|Bns001
mn021|huh huh.|B|Bns001
mn082|uh|F|Bns001
mn082|and when you when you will go back to spain right?|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah sure.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah so and and that's why in principle the skills will be always available i guess.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn021|and and|D|Bns001
mn082|if there is a certain type of project in the home countries and then the uh institutions and|D|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn021|not only this.|S|Bns001
mn021|we can even use this platform to to get some european projects in the future.|S|Bns001
mn021|because you know sometimes uh it's a good thing.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|maybe.|S|Bns001
mn082|currently no money is available you know.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah but uh this will i think this will improve over time i'm sure.|S|Bns001
mn021|so uh|F|Bns001
mn021|probably.|S|Bns001
mn021|you know this kind of joint work of different countries companies universities this is usually the best uh the best place to to put a project on.|S|Bns001
mn021|because it is involving different partners from different points of of europe.|S|Bns001
mn082|now i will not prevent anybody from getting some cake.|S|Bns001
mn082|and we are sitting here together.|S|Bns001
mn082|it's uh very uh very slow in principle.|S|Bns001
mn082|but my last question is for wilbert.|S|Bns001
mn082|wilbert you i i think you got the basic idea.|S|Bns001
mn082|because it was mostly discussed with you here from this current available scrap project proposal.|S|Bns001
mn082|don't you think that k.p.n. could be convinced to go on this way what i mentioned before?|Q|Bns001
mn082|there's no way.|S|Bns001
mn081|no.|S|Bns001
mn082|they needed definitely in principle some kind of service or device or product or whatever.|S|Bns001
mn081|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn081|that's right now the the status.|S|Bns001
mn081|yes.|S|Bns001
mn082|can we both have together maybe i think it's a little bit more easier a discussion on thursday?|Q|Bns001
mn081|i'm out for one a week and a half.|S|Bns001
mn081|so on wednesday thursday friday i have a workshop at stanford.|S|Bns001
mn082|okay.|S|Bns001
mn081|and next week i have a week on holiday.|S|Bns001
mn082|okay.|S|Bns001
mn082|maybe that's enough time for you to consider a little bit more in this direction.|S|Bns001
mn081|could be.|S|Bns001
mn082|and then we could have uh discussion.|S|Bns001
mn082|and maybe this one is an overall work in principle where everybody could hook in and and get certain kind of small portions to solve it.|S|Bns001
mn081|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn081|so so the only solution would for for k.p.n. would be that there is a a project in this area.|S|Bns001
mn082|and|D|Bns001
mn081|so that makes sense to do in this this i mean the bay area.|S|Bns001
mn021|huh huh.|B|Bns001
mn081|with a group of uh a few people.|S|Bns001
mn081|like four or something.|S|Bns001
mn081|and that connects to this project.|S|Bns001
mn081|so one somebody or two some bodies can be found uh founded or get money to join this project.|S|Bns001
mn081|but that the other four should build a service on top of it that has a clear business focus.|S|Bns001
mn082|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn081|it means uh a a u.m.t.s. service basically.|S|Bns001
mn082|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn082|can you consider also in the meantime some potential u.m.t.s. services besides this one?|Q|Bns001
mn081|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn081|yeah but you see the the they ask something pretty strange.|S|Bns001
mn082|and|D|Bns001
mn081|they they want something pretty strange from me that i think of a service.|S|Bns001
mn081|a network service.|S|Bns001
mn081|there are sixty million billion people in the in the world that think of services all day.|S|Bns001
mn081|and try to make a lot of money with it in the form of start-ups or whatever.|S|Bns001
mn081|and just think of a service like that if i could do this.|S|Bns001
mn082|no but uh fff maybe based on this one and you see the networking stuff.|S|Bns001
mn082|that it is a little bit more evolved and than in the the core network technology in the access network i would like to say.|S|Bns001
mn081|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn082|and this is aligned then as much as possible to the internet.|S|Bns001
mn082|that's the basic idea.|S|Bns001
mn082|that you can have a certain kind of service which make use of these novel things.|S|Bns001
mn081|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn082|because normally i i believe the the the people are either on the application layer.|S|Bns001
mn081|i you know|D|Bns001
mn082|that means higher than layer four.|S|Bns001
mn082|or they are on layer one to up to layer four.|S|Bns001
mn082|and the service people are considering|D|Bns001
mn082|okay u.m.t.s.|S|Bns001
mn082|you have some location information.|S|Bns001
mn082|and maybe you are have the infrastructure in the car.|S|Bns001
mn082|so if i provide a certain kind of service independently what the network is offering you know.|S|Bns001
mn082|because they do not consider it very well.|S|Bns001
mn082|they know there is a certain kind of location information.|S|Bns001
mn082|and you have a g.p.s.|S|Bns001
mn082|and they know okay it's based on satellite.|S|Bns001
mn082|and there's u.m.t.s. that is based on base station.|S|Bns001
mn082|there's all that they consider.|S|Bns001
mn082|and then assume okay i can do that.|S|Bns001
mn082|and the networking guy said okay it would be great to have multicast and all these kind of things in the network.|S|Bns001
mn082|but do not consider really what a sense of benefit uh for applications.|S|Bns001
mn082|there were new old application make use of it.|S|Bns001
mn082|and how can new application arise.|S|Bns001
mn082|which we haven't considered up to now based on this new network function l.a.t. enrich enriched network function l.a.t.|S|Bns001
mn082|so i think it's worth to to consider something in that way.|S|Bns001
mn081|well until now i have been trying to think about it.|S|Bns001
mn081|but uh to me|D|Bns001
mn081|what i have every every time i encountered it it is all this is all pretty close by.|S|Bns001
mn081|like the industry is already behind this.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah what is our|D|Bns001
mn081|so they they want to make this available pretty soon.|S|Bns001
mn081|so i'm just trying to think uh more ahead like uh use the wireless device as a only as a signalling thing or something.|S|Bns001
mn081|so so whenever you come in with your uh g.s.m. phone and there is a p.c. available like everything will be directed to the the bigger device or something.|S|Bns001
mn081|so more services like that.|S|Bns001
mn081|i think they are working pretty hard to get i.p. available very good and efficiently from uh two mobile devices or wireless devices.|S|Bns001
mn082|not currently there is a technology split.|S|Bns001
mn081|a thing|D|Bns001
mn082|of course you have i.p. in the mobile device.|S|Bns001
mn082|but if you see the strange protocols text.|S|Bns001
mn082|there's i.p. over i.p. and tunnels and and whatever.|S|Bns001
mn082|so but it's uh looks very strange to me.|S|Bns001
mn082|because you have different numbering screens concerning you have a phone number.|S|Bns001
mn082|you have to map it to i.p. addresses.|S|Bns001
mn082|and and so on.|S|Bns001
mn082|but for me you have not the end to end parts of for for i.p. functionality.|S|Bns001
mn082|we are far away from that.|S|Bns001
mn082|and if you take a really look to the g.p.r.s. protocols texts and i believe also they apply for u.m.t.s. but i'm not|D|Bns001
mn082|uh very familiar with that.|S|Bns001
mn082|and the next generations access network is will come soon.|S|Bns001
mn082|you see it's every three years or four years they will have a new generation.|S|Bns001
mn081|and there's a we|D|Bns001
mn082|but anyway you|D|Bns001
mn081|our group might want to focus on the uh i.p. over ether no nets.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn081|or something like|D|Bns001
mn081|or over ether.|S|Bns001
mn082|why?|Q|Bns001
mn082|what kind what kind i.p. over what do you call it?|Q|Bns001
mn081|no nets.|S|Bns001
mn082|no net?|Q|Bns001
mn081|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn082|that would be great.|S|Bns001
mn081|over|D|Bns001
mn081|like only over ether.|S|Bns001
mn081|carefully integrated for net.|S|Bns001
mn081|but there is no net.|S|Bns001
mn081|if you want to do make like also for wireless devices end to end i.p. available that could be a vision.|S|Bns001
mn081|like|F|Bns001
mn082|can you repeat it?|Q|Bns001
mn081|well so he he says well i.p. to i.p. or end to end i.p. is far well it's far away.|S|Bns001
mn081|um|F|Bns001
mn081|so you what you might want to do is well get u.m.t.s. out there.|S|Bns001
mn081|and just do uh i.p.'s playing over radio.|S|Bns001
mn082|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn082|something like that is my final vision.|S|Bns001
mn081|like like s.d.h.i.p. over fiber or w.d.w.d.m.|S|Bns001
mn082|uhhuh.|B|Bns001
mn081|this gets rid of the s.d.h.|S|Bns001
mn081|or well start with get rid of the a.t.m. first.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|a.t.m. stuff.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn081|and then get rid of s.d.h.|S|Bns001
mn082|there's the problem is is you see that the providers uh have always there broken view for for the management.|S|Bns001
mn082|if you have different kind of protocols texts and network management system and the billing system and all these kinds of things which is besides the networking stuff in principle but you still need it is uh not aligned.|S|Bns001
mn081|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|we have it for different islands.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh huh.|D|Bns001
mn082|and and|F|Bns001
mn082|well that's my final vision you know.|S|Bns001
mn082|if you have really then i.p. networks at a certain generation where you have really the physical media and where necessary uh additional maclear protocols.|S|Bns001
mn082|and then you have really always end to end.|S|Bns001
mn082|it makes you things much more simple much more easier.|S|Bns001
mn021|uh|F|Bns001
mn082|uh but is far far away you know.|S|Bns001
mn021|unless unless we speak about quality of service.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|B|Bns001
mn021|which is not uh embedded on on i.p. services.|S|Bns001
mn082|yeah but you have the extension for the uh quality of service mechanism.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah but|D|Bns001
mn082|which you have to map then to the underlying technology.|S|Bns001
mn021|yeah but for example nobody's really using r.s.v.p.|S|Bns001
mn082|and|F|Bns001
mn082|yeah but maybe in the lan interface it makes.|S|Bns001
mn082|since to use it|D|Bns001
mn081|uh you guys do that discussion later on please.|S|Bns001
mn082|and and but|D|Bns001
mn082|yeah.|S|Bns001
mn081|uh?|Q|Bns001
mn082|but i think we we will miss the cake.|S|Bns001
mn021|okay sorry sorry.|S|Bns001
mn081|r.s.v.p.|S|Bns001
mn082|and i think we should stop now but please everybody|D|Bns001
mn082|short|D|Bns001
mn082|uh|D|Bns001
mn082|go on with considerations and potential.|S|Bns001
mn082|and and uh|F|Bns001
mn082|um we didn't make much progress today in the meeting.|S|Bns001
mn082|but anyway this kind of activity lives from all from the input of all.|S|Bns001
mn082|and so i really|D|Bns001
mn082|if somebody has an idea send an email.|S|Bns001
mn082|and then i would like to enforce everybody|D|Bns001
mn082|not that i'm doing everything.|S|Bns001
mn082|i could not i didn't have the time in the past.|S|Bns001
mn082|and i will not have it in the future.|S|Bns001
mn082|and maybe i will stay here only four weeks or five weeks.|S|Bns001
mn082|so it would be really not the best thing if the activity is dead when i am leaving.|S|Bns001
mn082|and if i stay longer of course we can go on.|S|Bns001
mn082|but nevertheless i rely heavily uh also from the contributions of everybody.|S|Bns001
mn082|and it's in their own interest.|S|Bns001
mn021|uhhuh huh.|B|Bns001
mn021|that's right.|S|Bns001
mn082|so if there is certain kind of idea or questions or whatever we are only a small group of people.|S|Bns001
mn082|we can easily join on a white board and and start a discussion.|S|Bns001
mn021|well if klaus|D|Bns001
mn082|it must not be on every tuesday you know.|S|Bns001
mn021|okay.|S|Bns001
mn082|at a certain time.|S|Bns001
mn082|and i try to motivate the people.|S|Bns001
mn082|that it's free.|S|Bns001
mn082|that's a starting.|S|Bns001
mn082|that's a ramp.|S|Bns001
mn082|and we can go in different directions.|S|Bns001
mn082|and if you have a real focus on the certain novel thing for the services or u.m.t.s. or whatever great.|S|Bns001
mn082|if not the long term and then these things must be nevertheless must be defined in much more detail.|S|Bns001
