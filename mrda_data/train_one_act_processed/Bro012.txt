me018|okay we're on.|S|Bro012
me013|okay so uh had some interesting mail from uh dan ellis.|S|Bro012
me013|actually i think he he redirected it to everybody also.|S|Bro012
me013|so uh the p d a mikes uh have a big bunch of energy at at uh five hertz.|S|Bro012
me013|uh|F|Bro012
me013|where this came up was that uh i was showing off these wave forms that we have on the web.|S|Bro012
me013|and and uh i just sort of hadn't noticed this but that the major major component in the wave in the second wave form in that pair of wave forms is actually the air conditioner.|S|Bro012
me013|so|F|Bro012
me013|so|F|Bro012
me013|i i have to be more careful about using that as a as a as a good illustration.|S|Bro012
me013|uh in fact it's not of uh of the effects of room reverberation.|S|Bro012
me013|it isn't a bad illustration of the effects of uh room noise on on uh some mikes.|S|Bro012
me013|uh but|F|Bro012
me013|so|F|Bro012
me013|and then we had this other discussion about um whether this affects the dynamic range.|S|Bro012
me013|because i know although we start off with thirty two bits you end up with uh sixteen bits.|S|Bro012
me013|and you know are we getting hurt there?|Q|Bro012
me013|but uh dan is pretty confident that we're not that that quantization error is not is still not a significant factor there.|D|Bro012
me013|so|F|Bro012
me013|so there was a question of whether we should change things here.|S|Bro012
me013|whether we should change a capacitor on the input box for that.|S|Bro012
me013|or whether we should|D|Bro012
me018|yeah he suggested a smaller capacitor.|S|Bro012
me018|right?|Q|Bro012
me018|for the p d a's?|Q|Bro012
me013|right.|S|Bro012
me013|but then i had some other uh discussions with him.|S|Bro012
me013|and the feeling was once we start monkeying with that uh many other problems could happen.|S|Bro012
me013|and additionally we we already have a lot of data that's been collected with that.|S|Bro012
me013|so|F|Bro012
me018|yeah.|S|Bro012
me013|a simple thing to do is|D|Bro012
me013|he he he has a i forget if it this was in that mail or in the following mail.|S|Bro012
me013|but he has a a simple filter a digital filter that he suggested.|S|Bro012
me013|we just run over the data before we deal with it.|S|Bro012
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|um the other thing that i don't know the answer to but when people are using feacalc here uh whether they're using it with the high pass filter option or not.|S|Bro012
me013|and i don't know if anybody knows.|S|Bro012
me006|um i could go check.|S|Bro012
me013|but|F|Bro012
me013|yeah.|F|Bro012
me013|so when we're doing all these things using our software there is|D|Bro012
me013|um if it's if it's based on the rasta p l p program which does both p l p and rasta p l p um then uh there is an option there which then comes up through to feacalc which um allows you to do high pass filtering.|S|Bro012
me013|and in general we like to do that because of things like this.|S|Bro012
me013|and it's it's pretty it's not a very severe.|S|Bro012
me013|filter doesn't affect speech frequencies.|S|Bro012
me013|even pretty low speech frequencies at all.|S|Bro012
me013|but it's|D|Bro012
me018|what's the cutoff frequency it used?|Q|Bro012
me013|oh.|F|Bro012
me013|i don't know.|S|Bro012
me013|i wrote this a while ago.|S|Bro012
me018|is it like twenty?|Q|Bro012
me013|something like that.|S|Bro012
me018|yeah.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|i mean i think there's some effect above twenty.|S|Bro012
me013|but it's it's it's it's mild.|S|Bro012
me013|so i mean it probably there's probably some effect up to a hundred hertz or something but it's it's pretty mild.|S|Bro012
me013|i don't know in the in the strut implementation of the stuff is there a high pass filter or a pre emphasis or something in the|D|Bro012
mn007|uh i think we use a pre emphasis.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|so we we we want to go and check that in for anything that we're going to use the p d a mike for.|S|Bro012
me013|uh he says that there's a pretty good roll off in the p z m mikes.|S|Bro012
me013|so we don't need need to worry about them one way or the other.|S|Bro012
me013|but if we do make use of the cheap mikes uh we want to be sure to do that that filtering before we process it.|S|Bro012
me013|and then again if it's|D|Bro012
me013|uh depending on the option that the our our software is being run with it's it's quite possible that's already being taken care of.|S|Bro012
me013|uh but i also have to pick a different picture to show the effects of reverberation.|S|Bro012
me013|uh|F|Bro012
me018|did somebody notice it during your talk?|Q|Bro012
me013|uh no.|S|Bro012
me018|huh.|B|Bro012
me013|well|D|Bro012
me013|uh|F|Bro012
me013|well if they made output.|S|Bro012
me013|they were they were you know they were nice.|S|Bro012
me018|didn't say anything?|Q|Bro012
me013|but i mean the thing is it was|D|Bro012
me013|since i was talking about reverberation and showing this thing that was noise it wasn't a good match.|S|Bro012
me013|but it certainly was still uh an indication of the fact that you get noise with distant mikes.|S|Bro012
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|uh it's just not a great example because not only isn't it reverberation but it's a noise that we definitely know what to do.|S|Bro012
me013|so i mean it doesn't take deep a new bold new methods to get rid of uh five hertz noise.|S|Bro012
me013|so|F|Bro012
me018|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|um uh but|F|Bro012
me013|so it was it was a bad example in that way.|S|Bro012
me013|but it's it still is it's the real thing that we did get out of the microphone at distance.|S|Bro012
me013|so it wasn't it it wasn't wrong it was inappropriate.|S|Bro012
me013|so so uh but uh|F|Bro012
me013|yeah someone noticed it later pointed it out to me and i went oh man.|S|Bro012
me013|why didn't i notice that.|S|Bro012
me018|huh.|B|Bro012
me013|um so um|F|Bro012
me013|so i think we'll change our our picture on the web when we're|D|Bro012
me013|one of the things i was i mean i was trying to think about what what's the best way to show the difference and i had a couple of thoughts.|S|Bro012
me013|one was that spectrogram that we show is okay.|S|Bro012
me013|but the thing is the eyes uh and the the brain behind them are so good at picking out patterns from from noise that in first glance.|S|Bro012
me013|you look at them it doesn't seem like it's that bad.|S|Bro012
me013|uh because there's many features that are still preserved.|S|Bro012
me013|so one thing to do might be to just take a piece of the uh of the spectrogram where you can see that something looks different.|S|Bro012
me013|and blow it up and have that be the part that's just to show as well.|S|Bro012
me018|uhhuh uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|you know.|S|Bro012
me013|some things are going to be hurt.|S|Bro012
me013|um another i was thinking of was um taking some spectral slices.|S|Bro012
me013|like uh like we look at with the recognizer.|S|Bro012
me013|and look at the spectrum or cepstrum that you get out of there.|S|Bro012
me013|and the the uh um the reverberation uh does make it does change that.|S|Bro012
me018|huh.|B|Bro012
me013|and so maybe maybe that would be more obvious.|S|Bro012
me026|spectral slices?|Q|Bro012
me013|yeah.|S|Bro012
me026|what what do you mean?|Q|Bro012
me013|well i mean um all the recognizers look at frames.|S|Bro012
me018|so like one instant in time.|S|Bro012
me013|so they they look at|D|Bro012
me026|okay.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah look at a|D|Bro012
me013|so it's|D|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|at one point in time or uh twenty over twenty milliseconds or something you have a spectrum or a cepstrum.|S|Bro012
me026|okay.|B|Bro012
me013|that's what i meant by a slice.|S|Bro012
me026|i see.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|and if you look at|D|Bro012
me018|you could just you could just throw up you know uh the uh some m f c c feature vectors.|S|Bro012
me018|you know one from one one from the other and then you know you can look and see how different the numbers are.|S|Bro012
me013|right well that's why i saying.|S|Bro012
me018|i'm just kidding.|S|Bro012
me013|either well either spectrum or cepstrum.|S|Bro012
me013|but but i think the thing is you want to|D|Bro012
me018|i don't mean a graph.|S|Bro012
me013|oh.|B|Bro012
me018|i mean the actual numbers.|S|Bro012
me013|oh i see.|S|Bro012
me013|oh.|S|Bro012
me013|that would be lovely.|S|Bro012
me018|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
me018|see how different these sequences of numbers are.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|S|Bro012
me013|or i could just add them up and get a different total.|S|Bro012
me018|yeah.|S|Bro012
me018|it's not the square.|S|Bro012
me013|okay.|S|Bro012
me013|what else what's what else is going on?|Q|Bro012
mn007|uh yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah at first i had a remark.|S|Bro012
mn007|why i am wondering why the p d a is always so far.|S|Bro012
mn007|i mean we are always meeting at the beginning of the table and the p d a's there.|S|Bro012
me013|uh i guess because we haven't wanted to move it.|S|Bro012
me013|we we could we could move us.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah?|Q|Bro012
me013|and|F|Bro012
mn007|okay.|S|Bro012
me006|that's right.|S|Bro012
mn007|well anyway.|S|Bro012
mn007|um|F|Bro012
mn007|yeah so|D|Bro012
mn007|uh since the last meeting we've we've tried to put together um the clean low pass um downsampling upsampling i mean.|S|Bro012
mn007|uh the new filter that's replacing the l d a filters.|S|Bro012
mn007|and also the um delay issue.|S|Bro012
mn007|so that|D|Bro012
mn007|we considered the the delay issue on the for the online normalization.|S|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
mn007|so we've put together all this.|S|Bro012
mn007|and then we have results that are not um very impressive.|S|Bro012
mn007|well there is no real improvement.|S|Bro012
me013|but it's not worse.|S|Bro012
mn007|it's not|D|Bro012
me013|and it's better better latency.|S|Bro012
me013|right?|Q|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|well actually it's better.|S|Bro012
mn007|it seems better when we look at the mismatched case.|S|Bro012
mn007|but i think we are like like cheated here by the this problem.|S|Bro012
mn007|that uh in some cases when you modify slight slightly modify the initial condition you end up completely somewhere somewhere else in the in the space the parameters.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|so|F|Bro012
mn007|well the other system are for instance|D|Bro012
mn007|for italian is at seventy eight percent recognition rate on the mismatch.|S|Bro012
mn007|and this new system has eighty nine.|S|Bro012
mn007|but i don't think it indicates something really.|S|Bro012
mn007|i don't i don't think it means that the new system is more robust|D|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|or|D|Bro012
mn007|it's simply the fact that|D|Bro012
mn007|well|D|Bro012
me013|well the test would be if you then tried it on one of the other test sets if if it was|D|Bro012
me013|right so this was italian.|S|Bro012
me013|right?|Q|Bro012
mn007|yeah yeah.|S|Bro012
me013|so then if you take your changes.|S|Bro012
mn007|it's similar for other test sets.|S|Bro012
me013|and then|D|Bro012
mn007|but i mean from this seventy eight um percent recognition rate system i could change the transition probabilities for the the first h m m and it will end up to eighty nine also.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|by using point five instead of point six point four as in the the h t k script.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|so well that's|D|Bro012
me018|yeah.|B|Bro012
me018|yeah i looked at um looked at the results when stephane did that.|S|Bro012
mn007|well|D|Bro012
mn007|uh uh|D|Bro012
me018|and it's it's really really happens.|S|Bro012
mn007|this really happens.|S|Bro012
me018|i mean the only difference is you change the self loop transition probability by a tenth of a percent.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
me018|and it causes ten percent difference in the word error rate.|S|Bro012
me013|a tenth of a per cent.|S|Bro012
mn007|even tenth of a percent?|Q|Bro012
me018|yeah.|S|Bro012
me018|from point|D|Bro012
mn007|well we tried we tried point one.|S|Bro012
me018|i i'm sorry.|S|Bro012
me018|for point from you change at point one.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|huh.|D|Bro012
me013|oh.|S|Bro012
me018|and not tenth of a percent one tenth.|S|Bro012
me018|all right?|Q|Bro012
me013|yeah.|S|Bro012
me018|um so from point five|D|Bro012
me018|so from point six to point five and you get ten percent better.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me018|and it's i think it's what you basically hypothesized in the last meeting about uh it just being very|D|Bro012
me018|and i think you mentioned this in your e mail too|D|Bro012
mn007|huh yeah.|B|Bro012
me018|it's just very um|D|Bro012
me018|you know get stuck in some local minimum.|S|Bro012
me018|and this thing throws you out of it i guess.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|well what's what are according to the rules what what are we supposed to do about the transition probabilities?|Q|Bro012
me013|are they supposed to be point five or point six?|Q|Bro012
me018|i think you're not allowed to|D|Bro012
me018|yeah.|S|Bro012
me018|that's supposed to be point six for the self loop.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|point it's supposed to be point six.|S|Bro012
me018|yeah.|S|Bro012
me018|but changing it to point five i think is|D|Bro012
me018|which gives you much better results.|S|Bro012
me018|but that's not allowed.|S|Bro012
me013|but not allowed.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah okay.|S|Bro012
me018|yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah but even if you use point five i'm not sure it will always give you the better results.|S|Bro012
mn007|on other test set or it|D|Bro012
me018|yeah.|S|Bro012
me018|right we only tested it on the the medium mismatch.|S|Bro012
mn007|on the other training set i mean.|S|Bro012
me018|right?|Q|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro012
me018|you said on the other cases you didn't notice|D|Bro012
mn007|but i think|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|i think the reason is|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah i i|D|Bro012
mn007|it was in my mail i think also is the fact that the mismatch is trained only on the far microphone.|S|Bro012
mn007|well in for the mismatched case everything is um using the far microphone training and testing.|S|Bro012
mn007|whereas for the highly mismatched training is done on the close microphone.|S|Bro012
mn007|so it's it's clean speech basically.|S|Bro012
mn007|so you don't have this problem of local minima probably.|S|Bro012
mn007|and for the well match it's a mix of close microphone and distant microphone.|S|Bro012
mn007|and|F|Bro012
mn007|well|F|Bro012
me018|i did notice uh something|D|Bro012
mn007|so i think the mismatch is the more difficult for the training part.|S|Bro012
me018|somebody i think it was morgan suggested at the last meeting that i actually count to see how many parameters and how many frames.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me018|and there are uh almost one point eight million frames of training data.|S|Bro012
me018|and less than forty thousand parameters in the baseline system.|S|Bro012
me013|huh.|B|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me018|so it's very very few parameters compared to how much training data.|S|Bro012
fn002|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|well yes.|S|Bro012
me013|so|D|Bro012
me013|and that that says that we could have lots more parameters actually.|S|Bro012
me018|yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|D|Bro012
me018|yeah.|B|Bro012
me018|i did one quick experiment just to make sure i had everything worked out.|S|Bro012
me018|and i just uh for most of the um|D|Bro012
me018|for for all of the digit models they end up at three mixtures per state.|S|Bro012
me018|and so i just did a quick experiment where i changed it so it went to four.|S|Bro012
me018|and um it it it didn't have a any significant effect at the uh medium mismatch and high mismatch cases.|S|Bro012
me018|and it had it was just barely significant for the well matched.|S|Bro012
me018|better.|S|Bro012
me018|uh so i'm going to run that again but um with many more uh mixtures per state.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah because at forty i mean you could you could have|D|Bro012
me013|uh|F|Bro012
me013|yeah easily four times as many parameters.|S|Bro012
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me018|and i think also just seeing what we saw uh in terms of the expected duration of the silence model|D|Bro012
me018|when we did this tweaking of the self loop|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me018|the silence model expected duration was really different.|S|Bro012
me018|and so in the case where um it had a better score the silence model expected duration was much longer.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me018|so it was like it was a better match.|S|Bro012
me018|i think you know if we make a better silence model i think that will help a lot too.|S|Bro012
me018|um for a lot of these cases.|S|Bro012
me018|so|F|Bro012
me018|but one one thing i i wanted to check out before i increased the um number of mixtures per state was uh in their default training script they do an initial set of three re estimations.|S|Bro012
me018|and then they built the silence model.|S|Bro012
me018|and then they do seven iterations then the add mixtures.|S|Bro012
me018|and they do another seven then they add mixtures.|S|Bro012
me018|then they do a final set of seven and they quit.|S|Bro012
me018|seven seems like a lot to me.|S|Bro012
me018|and it also makes the experiments go take a really long time.|S|Bro012
me018|i mean to do one turnaround of the well matched case takes like a day.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me018|and so you know in trying to run these experiments i notice you know it's difficult to find machines you know compute the run on.|S|Bro012
me018|and so one of the things i did was i compiled h t k for the linux machines.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me018|because we have this one from i b m that's got like five processors in it.|S|Bro012
me013|right.|B|Bro012
me018|and so now i'm you can run stuff on that and that really helps a lot because now we've got you know extra machines that we can use for compute.|S|Bro012
fn002|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me018|and if i'm running an experiment right now where i'm changing the number of iterations from seven to three.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
me018|just to see how it affects the baseline system.|S|Bro012
me018|and so if we can get away with just doing three we can do many more experiments more quickly.|S|Bro012
me018|and if it's not a a huge difference from running with seven iterations um you know we should be able to get a lot more experiments done.|S|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
me018|and so i'll let you know what what happens with that.|S|Bro012
me018|but if we can you know run all of these back ends with many fewer iterations and on linux boxes we should be able to get a lot more experimenting done.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me018|so|F|Bro012
me018|so i wanted to experiment with cutting down the number of iterations before i increased the number of gaussians.|S|Bro012
me013|right.|B|Bro012
me013|sorry.|S|Bro012
me013|so um how's it going on the|D|Bro012
mn007|um|D|Bro012
me013|so you you did some things.|S|Bro012
me013|they didn't improve things in a way that convinced you you'd substantially improved anything.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|D|Bro012
me013|but they're not making things worse and we have reduced latency.|S|Bro012
me013|right?|Q|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|but actually um actually it seems to do a little bit worse for the well matched case.|S|Bro012
mn007|and we just noticed that|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah actually the way the final score is computed is quite funny.|S|Bro012
mn007|it's not a mean of word error rate.|S|Bro012
mn007|it's not a weighted mean of word error rate.|S|Bro012
mn007|it's a weighted mean of improvements.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|so|D|Bro012
mn007|which means that actually the weight on the well matched is|D|Bro012
mn007|well i well what what what happened is that if you have a small improvement or a small if on the well matched case it will have uh huge influence on the improvement compared to the reference.|S|Bro012
mn007|because the reference system is is is quite good for for the well well matched case also.|S|Bro012
me018|so it it weights the improvement on the well matched case really heavily compared to the improvement on the other cases?|Q|Bro012
mn007|no but it's the weighting of the of the improvement.|S|Bro012
mn007|not of the error rate.|S|Bro012
me018|yeah.|B|Bro012
me018|yeah and it's hard to improve on the on the best case.|S|Bro012
me018|because it's already so good.|S|Bro012
me018|right?|Q|Bro012
mn007|yeah but what i mean is that you can have a huge improvement on the h h m k's.|S|Bro012
mn007|uh like five percent uh absolute.|S|Bro012
mn007|and this will not affect the final score almost.|S|Bro012
mn007|uh this will almost not affect the final score because this improvement because the improvement uh relative to the the baseline is small.|S|Bro012
mn007|uh|F|Bro012
me013|so they do improvement in terms of uh accuracy rather than word error rate?|Q|Bro012
mn007|uh improvement|D|Bro012
mn007|no it's compared to the word it's improvement on the word error rate.|S|Bro012
me013|so|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|sorry.|S|Bro012
me013|okay.|S|Bro012
me013|so if you have uh ten percent error and you get five percent absolute uh improvement then that's fifty percent.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|S|Bro012
me013|okay so what you're saying then is that if it's something that has a small word error rate then uh a even a relatively small improvement on it in absolute terms will show up as quite quite large in this.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|is that what you're saying?|Q|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro012
me013|yes.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|okay.|S|Bro012
me013|but yeah that's that's it's the notion of relative improvement.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|word error rate.|S|Bro012
mn007|sure but when we think about the weighting which is point five point three point two it's on absolute on on relative figures.|S|Bro012
mn007|not|D|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|so when we look at this error rate|D|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|no.|S|Bro012
mn007|uh|F|Bro012
me013|that's why i've been saying we should be looking at word error rate uh and and not not at at accuracies.|S|Bro012
mn007|huh yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|huh yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|it's|D|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|i mean uh we probably should have standardized on that all the way through.|S|Bro012
me013|it's just|D|Bro012
me018|well|F|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me018|i mean it's not it's not that different.|S|Bro012
me018|right?|Q|Bro012
me018|i mean just subtract the accuracy.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|S|Bro012
me018|i mean|D|Bro012
me013|but you're but when you look at the numbers your sense of the relative size of things is quite different.|S|Bro012
me018|oh oh i see.|S|Bro012
me018|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|if you had ninety percent uh correct and five percent|D|Bro012
me013|five over ninety doesn't look like it's a big difference.|S|Bro012
me013|but five over ten is is big.|S|Bro012
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|so just when we were looking at a lot of numbers and getting sense of what was important.|S|Bro012
me018|i see i see.|S|Bro012
me018|yeah.|B|Bro012
me018|that makes sense.|S|Bro012
me013|um|F|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
me013|um|F|Bro012
mn007|well anyway|F|Bro012
mn007|uh|F|Bro012
mn007|so|F|Bro012
mn007|yeah so it hurts a little bit on the well match.|S|Bro012
mn007|and|F|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro012
me013|what's a little bit?|Q|Bro012
me013|like|D|Bro012
mn007|like it's difficult to say.|S|Bro012
mn007|because again|D|Bro012
mn007|um i'm not sure i have the|D|Bro012
mn007|um|F|Bro012
me018|hey morgan.|S|Bro012
me018|do you remember that signif program that we used to use for testing|D|Bro012
me018|is that still valid?|Q|Bro012
me018|i i've been using that.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah it was actually updated.|S|Bro012
me018|okay.|S|Bro012
me013|uh jeff updated it some years ago.|S|Bro012
me018|oh it was?|Q|Bro012
me018|oh i|D|Bro012
me013|and and uh cleaned it up made some things better in it.|S|Bro012
me018|okay.|S|Bro012
me013|so|D|Bro012
me018|i should find that new one.|S|Bro012
me018|i just use my old one from ninety two or whatever.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah i'm sure it's not that different.|S|Bro012
me013|but but he he uh he was a little more rigorous as i recall.|S|Bro012
me018|okay.|S|Bro012
mn007|right.|B|Bro012
mn007|so it's around like point five.|S|Bro012
mn007|no point six uh percent absolute on italian.|S|Bro012
me013|worse.|S|Bro012
mn007|worse yep.|S|Bro012
me013|out of what?|Q|Bro012
me013|i mean|D|Bro012
mn007|uh well we start from ninety four point sixty four.|S|Bro012
mn007|and we go to ninety four point o four.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|so that's six six point|D|Bro012
mn007|uh|F|Bro012
me018|ninety three point six four.|S|Bro012
me018|right?|Q|Bro012
me018|is the baseline.|S|Bro012
mn007|oh no i've ninety four.|S|Bro012
mn007|oh the baseline you mean.|S|Bro012
me018|yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|well i don't i'm not talking about the baseline here.|S|Bro012
me018|oh oh.|S|Bro012
mn007|i|D|Bro012
me018|i'm sorry.|S|Bro012
mn007|uh|F|Bro012
mn007|my baseline is the submitted system.|S|Bro012
me018|uh okay uh uh.|S|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
me018|sorry.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|uh|F|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro012
mn007|for finnish we start to ninety three point eight four.|S|Bro012
mn007|and we go to ninety three point seventy four.|S|Bro012
mn007|and for spanish we are we were at ninety five point o five.|S|Bro012
mn007|and we go to point sixty one.|S|Bro012
me013|okay so we are getting hurt somewhat.|S|Bro012
mn007|so|D|Bro012
me013|and is that|D|Bro012
me013|what|D|Bro012
me013|do you know what piece|D|Bro012
me013|you've done several changes here.|S|Bro012
me013|uh|F|Bro012
me013|do you know what|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|i guess i guess it's it's the filter.|S|Bro012
mn007|because nnn well uh we don't have complete result.|S|Bro012
mn007|but the filter so the filter with the shorter delay hurts on italian well matched.|S|Bro012
mn007|which|D|Bro012
mn007|and|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro012
mn007|and the other things like um downsampling upsampling don't seem to hurt.|S|Bro012
mn007|and the new online normalization neither.|S|Bro012
me018|i'm|D|Bro012
mn007|so|F|Bro012
me018|i'm really confused about something.|S|Bro012
me018|if we saw that making a small change like you know a tenth to the self loop had a huge effect can we really make any conclusions about differences in this stuff?|Q|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|yeah that's|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me018|i mean especially when they're this small.|S|Bro012
me018|i mean|D|Bro012
mn007|i think we can be completely fooled by this thing.|S|Bro012
mn007|but|D|Bro012
mn007|i don't know.|S|Bro012
me013|well yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|so there is first this thing.|S|Bro012
mn007|and then the|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah i computed the um like the confidence level on the different test sets.|S|Bro012
mn007|and for the well matched they are around um point six uh percent.|S|Bro012
mn007|for the mismatched they are around like let's say one point five percent.|S|Bro012
mn007|and for the well uh h m they are also around one point five.|S|Bro012
me013|but okay so you these these degradations you were talking about were on the well matched case.|S|Bro012
mn007|so|F|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro012
me013|uh do the does the new filter make things uh better or worse for the other cases?|Q|Bro012
mn007|but|D|Bro012
mn007|uh about the same.|S|Bro012
mn007|it doesn't hurt.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|doesn't hurt but doesn't get a little better or something.|S|Bro012
mn007|no.|S|Bro012
me013|no.|S|Bro012
me013|okay so um i guess the argument one might make is that yeah if you looked at one of these cases and you jiggle something and it changes then uh you're not quite sure what to make of it.|S|Bro012
me013|but when you look across a bunch of these and there's some some pattern|D|Bro012
me013|um|F|Bro012
me013|i mean so uh here's all the if if in all these different cases it never gets better and there's significant number of cases where it gets worse then you're probably hurting things i would say.|S|Bro012
me013|so um i mean at the very least that would be a reasonably prediction of what would happen with with a different test set that you're not jiggling things with.|S|Bro012
me013|so i guess the question is if you can do better than this?|Q|Bro012
me013|if you can if we can approximate the old numbers while still keeping the latency down.|S|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|uh so|F|Bro012
me013|um what i was asking though is uh are what's what's the level of communication with uh the o g i gang now about this?|Q|Bro012
me013|and|F|Bro012
mn007|well we are exchanging mail as soon as we we have significant results.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|um|F|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|for the moment they are working on integrating the um spectral subtraction apparently from ericsson.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|um|F|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|and so|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|we are working on our side on other things like uh also trying a spectral subtraction.|S|Bro012
mn007|but of of our own i mean another spectral subtraction.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|um|F|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|so i think it's it's okay.|S|Bro012
mn007|it's going|D|Bro012
me013|is there any further discussion about this this idea of of having some sort of source code control?|Q|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|well for the moment they're|D|Bro012
mn007|uh everybody's quite|D|Bro012
mn007|um|F|Bro012
mn007|there is this eurospeech deadline.|S|Bro012
mn007|so|F|Bro012
me013|i see.|S|Bro012
mn007|um and|F|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro012
mn007|but yeah.|F|Bro012
mn007|as soon as we have something that's significant and that's better than than what was submitted.|S|Bro012
mn007|we will fix fix the system.|S|Bro012
mn007|and|F|Bro012
mn007|but we've not discussed it it it this yet.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|yeah.|S|Bro012
me013|sounds like a great idea.|S|Bro012
me013|but but i think that that um he's saying people are sort of scrambling for a eurospeech deadline.|S|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
me013|but that'll be uh uh done in a week.|S|Bro012
me013|so maybe after this next one.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me018|wow!|S|Bro012
me018|already a week!|S|Bro012
me018|man!|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|S|Bro012
me018|you're right.|S|Bro012
me018|that's amazing.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|S|Bro012
me013|anybody in the in this group doing anything for eurospeech?|Q|Bro012
me013|or is that what is that|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah we are we are trying to to do something with the meeting recorder digits.|S|Bro012
me013|right.|S|Bro012
mn007|and|D|Bro012
mn007|but yeah.|F|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|D|Bro012
mn007|and the good thing is that there is this first deadline.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|and well some people from o g i are working on a paper for this.|S|Bro012
mn007|but there is also the um special session about aurora.|S|Bro012
mn007|which is uh which has an extended deadline.|S|Bro012
mn007|so|F|Bro012
mn007|the deadline is in may.|S|Bro012
me013|for uh oh for eurospeech?|Q|Bro012
mn007|for|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|so only for the experiments on aurora.|S|Bro012
me013|oh!|S|Bro012
mn007|so it it's good.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|oh a special dispensation.|S|Bro012
me013|that's great.|S|Bro012
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me018|where is eurospeech this year?|Q|Bro012
mn007|it's in denmark.|S|Bro012
me013|aalborg.|S|Bro012
me013|aalborg|D|Bro012
me013|uh|F|Bro012
me018|oh.|S|Bro012
me013|so the deadline|D|Bro012
me013|when's the deadline?|Q|Bro012
mn007|huh?|Q|Bro012
me013|when's the deadline?|Q|Bro012
mn007|i think it's the thirteenth of may.|S|Bro012
me013|that's great.|S|Bro012
me013|it's great.|S|Bro012
me013|so we should definitely get something in for that.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro012
me013|but on meeting digits maybe there's|D|Bro012
me013|maybe.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|so it would be for the first deadline.|S|Bro012
me013|maybe.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|nnn.|D|Bro012
me013|yeah so i mean i i think that you could certainly start looking at at the issue.|S|Bro012
me013|uh but but uh i think it's probably on from what stephane is saying it's it's unlikely to get sort of active participation from the two sides until after they've|D|Bro012
me018|well i could at least|D|Bro012
me018|well i'm going to be out next week.|S|Bro012
me018|but i could try to look into like this uh c v s over the web.|S|Bro012
me018|that seems to be a very popular way of people distributing changes and over you know multiple sites and things.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me018|so maybe if i can figure out how do that easily and then pass the information on to everybody so that it's you know as easy to do as possible.|S|Bro012
me018|and and people don't it won't interfere with their regular work.|S|Bro012
me018|then maybe that would be good.|S|Bro012
me018|and i think we could use it for other things around here too.|S|Bro012
me018|so|F|Bro012
me013|good.|S|Bro012
me026|that's cool.|S|Bro012
me026|and if you're interested in using c v s i've set it up here.|S|Bro012
me026|so|F|Bro012
me018|oh great.|S|Bro012
me018|okay.|S|Bro012
me026|um|D|Bro012
me018|i used it a long time ago.|S|Bro012
me018|but it's been a while.|S|Bro012
me018|so maybe i can ask you some questions.|S|Bro012
me026|oh.|S|Bro012
me026|so i'll be away tomorrow and monday but i'll be back on tuesday or wednesday.|S|Bro012
me018|okay.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|dave the other thing actually is is this business about this wave form.|S|Bro012
me013|maybe you and i can talk a little bit at some point about coming up with a better uh demonstration of the effects of reverberation for our web page.|S|Bro012
me013|because|D|Bro012
me013|uh the uh um|F|Bro012
me013|i mean actually the the|D|Bro012
me013|uh|F|Bro012
me013|it made a good good audio demonstration because when we could play that clip the the the really obvious difference is that you can hear two voices and in the second one and only hear|D|Bro012
me018|maybe we could just like talk into a cup.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|S|Bro012
me018|some good reverb.|S|Bro012
me013|no i mean it sound it sounds pretty reverberant.|S|Bro012
me013|but i mean you can't when you play it back in a room with a you know a big room nobody can hear that difference really.|S|Bro012
me026|yeah.|B|Bro012
me026|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|they hear that it's lower amplitude and they hear there's a second voice.|S|Bro012
me013|um but uh|F|Bro012
me013|that actually that makes for a perfectly good demo.|S|Bro012
me013|because that's a real obvious thing that you hear two voices.|S|Bro012
me018|but not of reverberation.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
me026|a boom.|S|Bro012
me013|well that that that's okay.|S|Bro012
me013|but for the the visual just you know i'd like to have uh uh you know the spectrogram again.|S|Bro012
me026|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|because you're you're you're visual uh abilities as a human being are so good you can pick out|D|Bro012
me013|you know you you look at the good one you look at the the screwed up one and and you can see the features in it without trying to.|S|Bro012
me018|i noticed that in the pictures.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
me018|i thought hey you know i|D|Bro012
me018|my initial thought was this is not too bad.|S|Bro012
me013|right.|S|Bro012
me013|but you have to you know if you look at it closely you see well here's a place where this one has a big formant.|S|Bro012
me013|uh uh formant major formants here are are moving quite a bit.|S|Bro012
me013|and then you look in the other one and they look practically flat.|S|Bro012
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|so i mean you could that's why i was thinking in a section like that you could take a look look at just that part of the spectrogram and you could say oh yeah.|S|Bro012
me013|this this really distorted it quite a bit.|S|Bro012
me018|yeah.|B|Bro012
me018|the main thing that struck me in looking at those two spectrograms was the difference in the high frequencies.|S|Bro012
me018|it looked like for the one that was farther away you know it really everything was attenuated.|S|Bro012
me018|and|F|Bro012
me013|right.|S|Bro012
me018|i mean that was the main visual thing that i noticed.|S|Bro012
me013|right.|B|Bro012
me013|but it's it's|D|Bro012
me013|uh|F|Bro012
me013|so|F|Bro012
me013|yeah.|F|Bro012
me013|so there are clearly are spectral effects.|S|Bro012
me013|since you're getting all this indirect energy then a lot of it does have have uh reduced high frequencies.|S|Bro012
me013|but um the other thing is the temporal courses of things really are changed and and uh we want to show that in some obvious way.|S|Bro012
me013|the reason i put the wave forms in there was because uh they they do look quite different.|S|Bro012
me013|uh a nd so i thought oh this is good.|S|Bro012
me013|but i i just|D|Bro012
me013|uh|F|Bro012
me013|after after uh they were put in there i didn't really look at them anymore.|S|Bro012
me013|because i just they were different.|S|Bro012
me013|so i want something that has a is a more interesting explanation for why they're different.|S|Bro012
me013|um|F|Bro012
me026|oh.|S|Bro012
me026|so maybe we can just substitute one of these wave forms.|S|Bro012
me026|and um then do some kind of zoom in on the spectrogram on an interesting area.|S|Bro012
me013|something like that.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|F|Bro012
me026|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|the other thing that we had in there that i didn't like was that um the most obvious characteristic of the difference uh when you listen to it is that there's a second voice.|S|Bro012
me013|and the the the the the uh cuts that we have there actually don't correspond to the full wave form.|S|Bro012
me013|it's just the first|D|Bro012
me013|i think there was something where he was having some trouble getting so much in.|S|Bro012
me013|or|D|Bro012
me013|i i forget the reason behind it.|S|Bro012
me013|but it it's um it's the first six seconds or something of it.|S|Bro012
me013|and it's in the seventh or eighth second or something where the second voice comes in.|S|Bro012
me013|so we we would like to actually see the voice coming in too i think.|S|Bro012
me026|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|since that's the most obvious thing when you listen to it.|S|Bro012
me013|so|F|Bro012
me013|um|F|Bro012
mn007|uh yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro012
mn007|i brought some i don't know if some figures here.|S|Bro012
mn007|well i start we started to work on spectral subtraction.|S|Bro012
mn007|and um the preliminary results were very bad.|S|Bro012
mn007|so the thing that we did is just to add spectral subtraction before this the wall uh process which contains l d a online normalization.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|and it hurts uh a lot.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|and so we started to look at at um things like this.|S|Bro012
mn007|which is|D|Bro012
mn007|well it's|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|so you have the c zero parameters for one uh italian utterance.|S|Bro012
fn002|you can.|D|Bro012
mn007|and i plotted this for two channels.|S|Bro012
mn007|channel zero is the close microphone.|S|Bro012
mn007|and channel one is the distant microphone.|S|Bro012
mn007|and it's perfectly synchronized.|S|Bro012
mn007|so|F|Bro012
mn007|and the sentence contain only one word which is due.|S|Bro012
mn007|and it can't clearly be seen.|S|Bro012
mn007|where where is it?|Q|Bro012
mn007|where is the word?|Q|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me018|this is this is|D|Bro012
me006|huh.|B|Bro012
me018|oh a plot of c zero.|S|Bro012
mn007|so|D|Bro012
me018|the energy.|S|Bro012
mn007|this is a plot of c zero uh when we don't use spectral subtraction.|S|Bro012
mn007|and when there is no online normalization.|S|Bro012
mn007|so|F|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|there is just some filtering with the l d a.|S|Bro012
mn007|and and some downsampling upsampling.|S|Bro012
me018|c zero is the close talking?|Q|Bro012
mn007|so|D|Bro012
me018|uh the close channel?|Q|Bro012
mn007|yeah yeah.|S|Bro012
me018|and channel one is the|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|so c zero is very clean actually.|S|Bro012
me018|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|uh then when we apply mean normalization it looks like the second figure.|S|Bro012
mn007|though it is not.|S|Bro012
mn007|which is good.|S|Bro012
mn007|well the noise part is around zero.|S|Bro012
mn007|and and then the third figure is what happens when we apply mean normalization and variance normalization.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|so|F|Bro012
mn007|what we can clearly see is that on the speech portion the two channel come becomes very close.|S|Bro012
mn007|but also what happens on the noisy portion is that the variance of the noise is|D|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me018|this is still being a plot of c zero?|Q|Bro012
mn007|yeah this is still c zero.|S|Bro012
me018|okay.|S|Bro012
me018|can i ask um what does variance normalization do?|Q|Bro012
me018|what is the effect of that?|Q|Bro012
me013|normalizes the variance.|S|Bro012
mn007|so it it|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|D|Bro012
mn007|it normalized the standard deviation.|S|Bro012
me018|i mean|D|Bro012
mn007|so it|D|Bro012
me018|yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|you you get an estimate of the standard deviation.|S|Bro012
me018|no i understand that.|S|Bro012
me018|but i mean|D|Bro012
mn007|that's|D|Bro012
mn007|um|F|Bro012
me018|no.|S|Bro012
me018|no i understand what it is.|S|Bro012
me018|but i mean what does it what's what is|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah but|D|Bro012
me018|uh|F|Bro012
me013|what's the rationale?|Q|Bro012
me018|yeah .yeah.|S|Bro012
me018|why why do it?|Q|Bro012
mn007|uh|F|Bro012
me013|well i mean because everything uh if you have a system based on gaussians everything is based on means and variances.|S|Bro012
me018|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|so if there's an overall reason|D|Bro012
me013|you know it's like uh if you were doing uh image processing.|S|Bro012
me013|and in some of the pictures you were looking at uh there was a lot of light.|S|Bro012
me013|and and in some there was low light.|S|Bro012
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|you know you would want to adjust for that in order to compare things.|S|Bro012
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|and the variance is just sort of like the next moment.|S|Bro012
me013|you know.|S|Bro012
me013|so uh what if um one set of pictures was taken uh so that throughout the course it was went through daylight and night uh um um ten times?|Q|Bro012
me013|another time it went|D|Bro012
me013|i mean is you know how how much how much|D|Bro012
me018|oh okay.|S|Bro012
me013|or no.|S|Bro012
me013|i guess a better example would be how much of the light was coming in from outside?|Q|Bro012
me013|rather than artificial light.|S|Bro012
me013|so if it was a lot if more was coming from outside then there'd be the bigger effect of the of the of the change in the|D|Bro012
me013|so every mean every all all of the the parameters that you have especially the variances are going to be affected by the overall variance.|S|Bro012
me018|oh okay.|S|Bro012
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|and so in principle you if you remove that source then you know you can|D|Bro012
me018|i see okay.|S|Bro012
me018|so would the major effect is that you're going to get is by normalizing the means.|S|Bro012
me018|but it may help|D|Bro012
me013|that's the first order but thing.|S|Bro012
me018|first order effects.|S|Bro012
me018|and it may help to do the variance.|S|Bro012
me013|but then the second order is is the variances.|S|Bro012
me018|okay.|S|Bro012
me018|okay.|S|Bro012
me013|because again if you if you're trying to distinguish between e and b|D|Bro012
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|if it just so happens that the e s were a more you know were recorded when when the energy was was was larger or something|D|Bro012
me018|huh huh.|B|Bro012
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|or the variation in it was larger uh than with the b s then this will be give you some some bias.|S|Bro012
me013|so the it's removing these sources of variability in the data that have nothing to do with the linguistic component.|S|Bro012
me018|okay.|S|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
me018|gotcha okay.|S|Bro012
me018|sorry to interrupt.|S|Bro012
mn007|yep.|B|Bro012
me013|but the the uh but let me ask ask you something.|S|Bro012
mn007|and it and this|D|Bro012
me013|is if if you have a good voice activity detector isn't isn't it going to pull that out?|Q|Bro012
mn007|yeah .sure.|S|Bro012
mn007|if they are good.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|well what it it shows is that yeah perhaps a good voice activity detector is is good before online normalization.|S|Bro012
mn007|and that's what uh we've already observed.|S|Bro012
mn007|but uh|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro012
mn007|voice activity detection is not an easy thing neither.|S|Bro012
me018|but after you do this after you do the variance normalization|D|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me018|i mean|D|Bro012
me018|i don't know it seems like this would be a lot easier than this signal to work with.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro012
mn007|so what i notice is that while i prefer to look at the second figure than at the third one.|S|Bro012
mn007|well because you clearly see where speech is.|S|Bro012
me018|yeah.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|F|Bro012
mn007|but the problem is that on the speech portion channel zero and channel one are more different .than when you use variance normalization where channel zero and channel one become closer.|S|Bro012
me013|right.|B|Bro012
me018|but for the purposes of finding the speech|D|Bro012
mn007|and|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah but here|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me018|you're more interested in the difference between the speech and the non speech?|Q|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro012
me018|right?|Q|Bro012
mn007|so i think|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro012
mn007|for i i think that it perhaps it shows that uh the parameters that the voice activity detector should use uh have to use should be different than the parameter that have to be used for speech recognition.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah so basically you want to reduce this effect.|S|Bro012
mn007|well|D|Bro012
me013|so you can do that by doing the voice activity detection.|S|Bro012
me013|you also could do it by uh spectral subtraction before the variance normalization.|S|Bro012
me013|right?|Q|Bro012
mn007|yeah but it's not clear.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|so uh|D|Bro012
mn007|so|F|Bro012
mn007|well it's just to|D|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|the the number that that are here are recognition experiments on italian h m and m m with these two kinds of parameters.|S|Bro012
mn007|and well it's better with variance normalization.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|so it does get better even though it looks ugly.|S|Bro012
mn007|uh|D|Bro012
me013|okay.|B|Bro012
me013|but does this have the voice activity detection in it?|Q|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro012
me013|okay.|S|Bro012
mn007|um|D|Bro012
me006|okay.|S|Bro012
me013|so|F|Bro012
me018|where's|D|Bro012
mn007|but the fact is that the voice activity detector doesn't work on channel one.|S|Bro012
mn007|so|F|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|S|Bro012
me018|where at what stage is the voice activity detector applied?|Q|Bro012
me018|is it applied here or after the variance normalization?|Q|Bro012
mn007|huh?|Q|Bro012
me013|spectral subtraction i guess.|S|Bro012
mn007|it's applied before variance normalization.|S|Bro012
me018|or|D|Bro012
mn007|so it's a good thing.|S|Bro012
mn007|because i guess voice activity detection on this should could be worse.|S|Bro012
me018|oh.|S|Bro012
me018|yeah.|F|Bro012
me018|is it applied all the way back here?|Q|Bro012
mn007|it's applied the|D|Bro012
mn007|um on|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|something like this.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me018|maybe that's why it doesn't work for channel one.|S|Bro012
mn007|perhaps yeah.|S|Bro012
me013|can i|D|Bro012
mn007|so we could perhaps do just mean normalization before v a d.|S|Bro012
me018|uhhuh.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|can i ask a i mean a sort of top level question?|Q|Bro012
me013|which is um if if most of what the o g i folk are working with is trying to integrate this other other uh spectral subtraction why are we worrying about it?|Q|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|about?|Q|Bro012
mn007|spectral subtraction?|Q|Bro012
me013|yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|it's just uh well it's another|D|Bro012
mn007|they are trying to to use the um the ericsson.|S|Bro012
mn007|and we're trying to use something something else.|S|Bro012
mn007|and|F|Bro012
mn007|yeah and also to understand what happens because|D|Bro012
me013|okay.|B|Bro012
mn007|uh fff|F|Bro012
mn007|well when we do spectral subtraction actually i think that this is the the two last figures.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|um it seems that after spectral subtraction speech is more emerging now uh than than before.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me018|speech is more what?|Q|Bro012
mn007|well the difference between the energy of the speech and the energy of the spectral subtracted noise portion is is larger.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|well if you compare the first figure to this one|D|Bro012
mn007|actually the scale is not the same.|S|Bro012
mn007|but if you look at the the numbers um you clearly see that the difference between the c zero of the speech and c zero of the noise portion is larger.|S|Bro012
mn007|uh but what happens is that after spectral subtraction you also increase the variance of this of c zero.|S|Bro012
mn007|and so if you apply variance normalization on this it completely screw everything.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|well|D|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|um uh yeah.|F|Bro012
mn007|so yeah.|F|Bro012
mn007|and what they did at o g i is just uh they don't use online normalization for the moment on spectral subtraction.|S|Bro012
mn007|and i think|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro012
mn007|i think as soon as they will try online normalization there will be a problem.|S|Bro012
mn007|so yeah we're working on the same thing but i think|D|Bro012
mn007|uh|F|Bro012
mn007|with different different system.|S|Bro012
mn007|and|F|Bro012
me013|right.|F|Bro012
me013|i mean the|D|Bro012
me013|intellectually it's interesting to work on things uh one way or the other.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|but i'm i'm just wondering if um on the list of things that there are to do|D|Bro012
me013|if there are things that we won't do because we've got two groups doing the same thing.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|um|D|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|that's|D|Bro012
me013|um|F|Bro012
me013|just just asking.|S|Bro012
me013|uh i mean it's|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah well|D|Bro012
mn007|uh|F|Bro012
me018|there also could be i mean i can maybe see a reason for both working on it too.|S|Bro012
me018|if um you know if if if you work on something else and and you're waiting for them to give you spectral subtraction|D|Bro012
me018|i mean it's hard to know whether the effects that you get from the other experiments you do will carry over once you then bring in their spectral subtraction module.|S|Bro012
me018|so it's it's almost like everything's held up waiting for this one thing.|S|Bro012
me018|i don't know if that's true or not.|S|Bro012
me018|but i could see how|D|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
me018|maybe that's what you were thinking.|S|Bro012
me013|i don't know i don't know.|S|Bro012
me013|i mean we still evidently have a latency reduction plan which which isn't quite what you'd like it to be.|S|Bro012
me013|that that seems like one prominent thing.|S|Bro012
me013|and then uh weren't issues of of having a a second stream or something?|Q|Bro012
me013|that was|D|Bro012
me013|was it|D|Bro012
me013|there was this business that you know we we could use up the full forty eight hundred bits.|S|Bro012
me013|and|F|Bro012
mn007|yeah but i think|D|Bro012
mn007|i think we want to work on this.|S|Bro012
mn007|they also want to work on this.|S|Bro012
mn007|so|F|Bro012
mn007|uh yeah.|F|Bro012
mn007|we we will try m s g.|S|Bro012
mn007|but um|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro012
mn007|and they are|D|Bro012
mn007|i think they want to work on the second stream also.|S|Bro012
mn007|but more with some kind of multi band.|S|Bro012
mn007|or well what they call trap or generalized trap.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|um so|F|Bro012
me013|okay.|F|Bro012
me013|do you remember when the next meeting is supposed to be?|Q|Bro012
mn007|it's uh in june.|S|Bro012
me013|the next uh|D|Bro012
me013|in june.|S|Bro012
me013|okay.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|yeah.|F|Bro012
me013|um yeah the other thing is that you saw that that mail about uh the v a d v a d's performing quite differently.|S|Bro012
me013|that that|D|Bro012
me013|uh|F|Bro012
me013|so um|F|Bro012
me013|this there was this experiment of uh what if we just take the baseline?|Q|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
me013|set uh of features.|S|Bro012
me013|just mel cepstra.|S|Bro012
me013|and you incorporate the different v a d's.|S|Bro012
me013|and it looks like the the french v a d is actually uh better significantly better.|S|Bro012
me018|improves the baseline?|Q|Bro012
me013|yeah.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|yeah but i don't know which v a d they use.|S|Bro012
mn007|uh if the use the small v a d|D|Bro012
mn007|i i think it's on|D|Bro012
mn007|i think it's easy to do better.|S|Bro012
mn007|because it doesn't work at all.|S|Bro012
mn007|so|F|Bro012
mn007|i i don't know which which one.|S|Bro012
mn007|it's pratibha that that did this experiment.|S|Bro012
fn002|yeah.|F|Bro012
mn007|um we should ask which v a d she used.|S|Bro012
fn002|i don't.|S|Bro012
fn002|he actually i think that he say with the good v a d of from ogi.|S|Bro012
fn002|and with the alcatel v a d.|S|Bro012
fn002|and the experiment was sometime better sometime worse.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah but i it's uh i think you were talking about the other mail that used v a d on the reference features.|S|Bro012
me013|yes.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
fn002|i don't remember.|S|Bro012
me013|and on that one uh the french one is was better.|S|Bro012
me013|it was just better.|S|Bro012
fn002|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|i mean it was enough better that that it would uh account for a fair amount of the difference between our performance actually.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
fn002|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|so uh|F|Bro012
me013|so if they have a better one we should use it.|S|Bro012
me013|i mean|D|Bro012
me013|you know?|Q|Bro012
me013|it's|D|Bro012
me013|you can't work on everything.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|uh uh yeah.|F|Bro012
mn007|yeah so we should find out if it's really better.|S|Bro012
mn007|i mean if it|D|Bro012
mn007|the compared to the small or the big network.|S|Bro012
fn002|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|and perhaps we can easily improve if if we put like mean normalization before the before the v a d.|S|Bro012
mn007|because as as you've mentioned|D|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
me013|hynek will be back in town uh the week after next.|S|Bro012
me013|back back in the country.|S|Bro012
me013|so|F|Bro012
me013|and start start organizing uh more visits and connections and so forth.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|and|F|Bro012
me013|uh|F|Bro012
me013|working towards june.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
fn002|also is stephane was thinking that maybe it was useful to to think about uh voiced unvoiced|D|Bro012
fn002|to work uh here in voiced unvoiced detection.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
fn002|and we are looking in the uh signal.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|yeah my feeling is that um actually when we look at all the proposals everybody is still using some kind of spectral envelope.|S|Bro012
mn007|and um it's|D|Bro012
me013|right.|B|Bro012
me013|no use of pitch uh basically.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|yeah well not pitch.|S|Bro012
mn007|but to look at the um fine at the at the high high resolution spectrum.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|so we don't necessarily want to find the the pitch of the of the sound.|S|Bro012
me013|well it|D|Bro012
mn007|but|D|Bro012
mn007|uh|D|Bro012
mn007|because i have a feeling that when we look when we look at the just at the envelope there is no way you can tell if it's voiced and unvoiced.|S|Bro012
mn007|if there is some|D|Bro012
mn007|it's it's easy in clean speech because voiced sound are more low frequency.|S|Bro012
mn007|and|F|Bro012
mn007|so there would be more|D|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|uh there is the first formant which is the larger.|S|Bro012
mn007|and then voiced sound are more high frequencies.|S|Bro012
mn007|because it's frication.|S|Bro012
mn007|and|F|Bro012
me013|right.|B|Bro012
mn007|but|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|F|Bro012
mn007|when you have noise there is no|D|Bro012
mn007|um if if you have a low frequency noise it could be taken for for voiced speech.|S|Bro012
mn007|and|F|Bro012
me013|yeah you can make these mistakes.|S|Bro012
mn007|so|F|Bro012
me013|but but|D|Bro012
me018|isn't there some other|D|Bro012
me018|uh|D|Bro012
mn007|so i think that it it would be good|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|well go go on.|S|Bro012
me018|uh i was just going to say isn't there aren't aren't there lots of ideas for doing voice activity or speech-nonspeech rather um by looking at um you know uh i guess harmonics|D|Bro012
me018|or looking across time|D|Bro012
me013|well i think he was talking about the voiced unvoiced though.|S|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
me013|right?|Q|Bro012
me018|yeah.|S|Bro012
me013|so not the speech-nonspeech.|S|Bro012
me018|well even with|D|Bro012
me018|uh uh|F|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
me018|you know uh even with the voiced voiced unvoiced.|S|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
me018|um|F|Bro012
me018|i thought that you or somebody was talking about|D|Bro012
me013|well|F|Bro012
mn007|so|D|Bro012
me013|uh yeah we should let him finish what he he was going to say.|S|Bro012
me018|okay.|S|Bro012
me013|and|F|Bro012
me018|so go ahead.|S|Bro012
mn007|um yeah so yeah i think if we try to develop a second stream|D|Bro012
mn007|well there would be one stream that is the envelope and the second it could be interesting to have.|S|Bro012
mn007|that's something that's more related to the fine structure of the spectrum.|S|Bro012
mn007|and|F|Bro012
mn007|yeah so i don't know.|S|Bro012
mn007|we were thinking about like using ideas from from larry saul.|S|Bro012
mn007|have a good voice detector|D|Bro012
mn007|have a good|D|Bro012
mn007|well voiced speech detector that's working on on the f f t.|S|Bro012
mn007|and uh|F|Bro012
mn007|larry saul could be an idea.|S|Bro012
mn007|we were are thinking about just kind of uh taking the spectrum.|S|Bro012
mn007|and computing the variance of of the high resolution spectrum and things like this.|S|Bro012
me013|so|D|Bro012
me013|okay.|S|Bro012
me013|so so many tell you something about that.|S|Bro012
me013|uh we had a guy here some years ago who did some work on um making use of voicing information uh to help in reducing the noise.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|so what he was doing is basically you you do estimate the pitch.|S|Bro012
me013|and|D|Bro012
me013|um|F|Bro012
me013|you from that you you estimate|D|Bro012
me013|or you estimate fine harmonic structure.|S|Bro012
me013|either way.|S|Bro012
me013|it's more or less the same.|S|Bro012
me013|but uh the thing is that um you then can get rid of things that are not|D|Bro012
me013|if there is strong harmonic structure you can throw away stuff that's that's non harmonic.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|and that that is another way of getting rid of part of the noise.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|so um that's something that is sort of finer.|S|Bro012
me013|brings in a little more information than just spectral subtraction.|S|Bro012
me013|um|F|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|and he had some i mean he did that sort of in combination with rasta.|S|Bro012
me013|it was kind of like rasta was taking care of convolutional stuff.|S|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|and he was|D|Bro012
me013|and and got some some decent results doing that.|S|Bro012
me013|so that that's another another way.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|but yeah there's there's|D|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
me013|right.|B|Bro012
me013|there's all these cues.|S|Bro012
me013|we've|D|Bro012
mn007|but|D|Bro012
me013|actually back when chuck was here we did some voiced unvoiced uh classification using a bunch of these.|S|Bro012
me013|and and|F|Bro012
me013|uh|F|Bro012
me013|works okay.|S|Bro012
me013|obviously it's not perfect.|S|Bro012
me013|but|D|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|um|F|Bro012
me013|but the thing is that you can't|D|Bro012
me013|given the constraints of this task we can't in a very nice way feed forward to the recognizer the information.|S|Bro012
me013|the probabilistic information that you might get about whether it's voiced or unvoiced|D|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|where we can't you know affect the the uh distributions or anything.|S|Bro012
me013|but we what we|D|Bro012
me013|uh|F|Bro012
me013|i guess we could|D|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
me018|didn't the head dude send around that message?|Q|Bro012
me018|yeah i think you sent us all a copy of the message.|S|Bro012
me018|where he was saying that|D|Bro012
me018|i'm not sure exactly what the gist of what he was saying.|S|Bro012
me018|but something having to do with the voice activity detector.|S|Bro012
me018|and that it will that people shouldn't put their own in or something.|S|Bro012
me018|it was going to be a|D|Bro012
me013|that but|D|Bro012
me013|okay.|F|Bro012
me013|so that's voice activity detector as opposed to voicing detector.|S|Bro012
mn007|they didn't.|S|Bro012
me013|so we're talking about something a little different.|S|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
me018|oh i'm sorry.|S|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
me018|i i missed that.|S|Bro012
me013|right?|Q|Bro012
me013|i guess what you could do maybe|D|Bro012
me013|this would be useful if if you have if you view the second stream|D|Bro012
me013|yeah before you before you do k l t's and so forth|D|Bro012
me013|if you do view it as probabilities|D|Bro012
me013|and if it's an independent|D|Bro012
me013|so if it's if it's uh not so much envelope based by fine structure based|D|Bro012
me013|uh looking at harmonicity or something like that|D|Bro012
me013|um if you get a probability from that information.|S|Bro012
me013|and then multiply it by you know multiply by all the voiced outputs and all the unvoiced outputs.|S|Bro012
me013|you know then use that as the|D|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|uh take the log of that|D|Bro012
me013|or uh uh pre nonlinearity|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|if|D|Bro012
me013|uh and do the k l t on the on on that.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|then that would that would i guess be uh a reasonable use of independent information.|S|Bro012
me013|so maybe that's what you meant.|S|Bro012
me013|and then that would be|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah well i was not thinking this|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah this could be|D|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|so you mean have some kind of probability for the the voicing?|Q|Bro012
mn007|and then use a tandem system.|S|Bro012
me013|right so you have a second neural net.|S|Bro012
me013|it could be pretty small.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah if you have a tandem system.|S|Bro012
me013|and then you have some kind of it can be pretty small net.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|we used we did some of this stuff.|S|Bro012
me013|uh i i did some years ago.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|and the and and you use the thing is to use information primarily that's different.|S|Bro012
me013|as you say it's more fine structure based than than envelope based.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|uh so then it you you you can pretty much guarantee it's stuff that you're not looking at very well with the other one.|S|Bro012
me013|and uh then you only use for this one distinction.|S|Bro012
mn007|all right.|B|Bro012
me013|and and so now you've got a probability of the cases.|S|Bro012
me013|and you've got uh the probability of the finer uh categories on the other side.|S|Bro012
me013|you multiply them where appropriate.|S|Bro012
me013|and|F|Bro012
me013|uh um|F|Bro012
mn007|i see yeah uhhuh.|S|Bro012
me013|if they really are from independent information sources then they should have different kinds of errors.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|and roughly independent errors.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|and it's a good choice for|D|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|uh|F|Bro012
me013|yeah that's a good idea.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|because yeah well spectral subtraction is good.|S|Bro012
mn007|and we could we could use the fine structure to to have a better estimate of the noise.|S|Bro012
mn007|but still there is this issue with spectral subtraction that it seems to increase the variance of of of|D|Bro012
me013|yeah.|S|Bro012
mn007|um|F|Bro012
mn007|well it's this musical noise which is annoying if you you do some kind of online normalization after.|S|Bro012
me013|right.|B|Bro012
mn007|so|F|Bro012
mn007|um|F|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|well spectral subtraction and online normalization don't seem to to go together very well.|S|Bro012
mn007|i|D|Bro012
me013|or if you do a spectral subtraction do some spectral subtraction first|D|Bro012
me013|and then do some online normalization.|S|Bro012
me013|then do some more spectral subtraction!|S|Bro012
me013|i mean maybe maybe you can do it layers or something.|S|Bro012
me013|so it doesn't doesn't hurt too much or something.|S|Bro012
mn007|uh yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|but it but uh anyway i think i was sort of arguing against myself there by giving that example.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|uh i mean because i was already sort of suggesting that we should be careful about not spending too much time on exactly what they're doing.|S|Bro012
me013|in fact if you get if you go into uh a uh harmonics related thing it's definitely going to be different than what they're doing.|S|Bro012
me013|and uh uh|F|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|should have some interesting properties in noise.|S|Bro012
me013|um i know that when have people have done um sort of the obvious thing of taking uh your feature vector and adding in some variables which are pitch related.|S|Bro012
me013|or|D|Bro012
me013|uh that it hasn't my impression it hasn't particularly helped.|S|Bro012
mn007|it it|D|Bro012
me013|uh has not.|S|Bro012
mn007|has not.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|oh.|D|Bro012
me013|but i think uh that's that's a question for this uh you know extending the feature vector versus having different streams.|S|Bro012
mn007|was it noisy condition?|Q|Bro012
mn007|the example that you you just|D|Bro012
me013|and and it may not have been noisy conditions.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
me013|i i don't remember the example.|S|Bro012
me013|but it was it was on some darpa data and some years ago.|S|Bro012
me013|and so it probably wasn't actually.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|but we were thinking we discussed with barry about this.|S|Bro012
mn007|and perhaps thinking we were thinking about some kind of cheating experiment where we would use timit.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
mn007|and see if giving the uh this voicing bit would help in in terms of uh frame classification.|S|Bro012
me013|why don't you why don't you just do it with aurora?|Q|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
mn007|yeah but but but we cannot do the cheating this cheating thing.|S|Bro012
me013|just any in in each in each frame|D|Bro012
me006|we're|D|Bro012
me013|uh|F|Bro012
me006|we need labels.|S|Bro012
mn007|well because we don't have|D|Bro012
me013|why not?|Q|Bro012
mn007|well for italian perhaps we have.|S|Bro012
mn007|but we don't have this labeling for aurora.|S|Bro012
mn007|we just have a labeling with word models.|S|Bro012
mn007|but not for phonemes.|S|Bro012
me013|i see.|D|Bro012
fn002|not for foreigners.|S|Bro012
me006|we don't have frame frame level transcriptions.|S|Bro012
fn002|right.|B|Bro012
me013|um|F|Bro012
mn007|um yeah.|F|Bro012
me013|but you could i mean you can you can align so that it's not perfect.|S|Bro012
me013|but if you if you know what was said.|S|Bro012
me013|and|F|Bro012
me018|but the problem is that their models are all word level models.|S|Bro012
me018|so there's no phone models that you get alignments for.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|oh.|S|Bro012
me018|you so you could find out where the word boundaries are.|S|Bro012
me018|but that's about it.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|S|Bro012
me013|i see.|S|Bro012
me006|but we could use uh the the noisy version that timit.|S|Bro012
me006|which you know is similar to the the noises found in the t i digits um portion of aurora.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|noise yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|yeah that's right yep.|S|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
mn007|well i guess i guess we can we can say that it will help.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|F|Bro012
mn007|but i don't know.|S|Bro012
mn007|if this voicing bit doesn't help uh i think we don't have to to work more about this.|S|Bro012
mn007|because|D|Bro012
mn007|uh it's just to know if it how much it will help.|S|Bro012
me013|uh.|F|Bro012
me013|yeah.|F|Bro012
mn007|and to have an idea of how much we can gain.|S|Bro012
me013|right.|F|Bro012
me013|i mean in experiments that we did a long time ago|D|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
me013|and different|D|Bro012
me013|it was probably resource management or something.|S|Bro012
me013|um i think you were getting something like still eight or nine percent error on the voicing as i recall.|S|Bro012
me013|and um so um|F|Bro012
me006|another person's voice.|D|Bro012
me013|what that said is that sort of left to its own devices like without the a strong language model and so forth that you would you would make significant number of errors just with your uh probabilistic machinery in deciding.|S|Bro012
me018|it also|D|Bro012
me013|one oh|D|Bro012
me018|yeah the though i think uh there was one problem with that in that you know we used canonical mapping.|S|Bro012
me018|so our truth may not have really been true to the acoustics.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me006|huh.|B|Bro012
me018|so|F|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
me013|yeah.|F|Bro012
me013|well back twenty years ago when i did this voiced unvoiced stuff we were getting more like ninety seven or ninety eight percent correct in voicing.|S|Bro012
me013|but that was speaker dependent actually.|S|Bro012
me013|we were doing training on a particular announcer.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|and and getting a very good handle on the features.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|and we did this complex feature selection thing where we looked at all the different possible features one could have for voicing.|S|Bro012
me013|and and and uh and exhaustively searched all size subsets.|S|Bro012
me018|wow!|S|Bro012
me013|and and uh for for that particular speaker and you'd find you know the five or six features which really did well on them.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|and then doing doing all of that we could get down to two or three per cent error.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|but that again was speaker dependent with lots of feature selection.|S|Bro012
me013|and a very complex sort of thing.|S|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
me013|so i would i would believe that uh it was quite likely that|D|Bro012
me013|um|F|Bro012
me013|looking at envelope only that we'd be significantly worse than that.|S|Bro012
mn007|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me013|uh|F|Bro012
mn007|and the all the the speechcorders?|Q|Bro012
mn007|what's the idea behind|D|Bro012
mn007|because they they have to|D|Bro012
mn007|oh they don't even have to detect voiced speech.|S|Bro012
me013|the modern ones don't do a a simple switch.|S|Bro012
mn007|they just work on the code book?|Q|Bro012
mn007|and find out the best excitation.|S|Bro012
me013|they work on the code book excitation.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah they do analysis by synthesis.|S|Bro012
me013|they try they they try every every possible excitation they have in their code book and find the one that matches best.|S|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|huh.|B|Bro012
mn007|all right.|B|Bro012
mn007|yeah.|B|Bro012
mn007|so it would not help.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|B|Bro012
me006|huh.|B|Bro012
me013|uh|F|Bro012
me013|okay.|S|Bro012
me018|can i just mention one other interesting thing?|Q|Bro012
me013|yeah.|S|Bro012
me018|um one of the ideas that we had come up with last week for things to try to improve the system|D|Bro012
me018|um|F|Bro012
me018|actually i i we didn't i guess i wrote this in after the meeting.|S|Bro012
me018|but the thought i had was um looking at the language model that's used in the h t k recognizer.|S|Bro012
me018|which is basically just a big loop.|S|Bro012
me006|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me018|right?|Q|Bro012
me018|so you it goes digit.|S|Bro012
fn002|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me018|and then that can be either go to silence or go to another digit.|S|Bro012
me018|which|D|Bro012
me018|that model would allow for the production of infinitely long sequences of digits.|S|Bro012
me018|right?|Q|Bro012
me013|right.|S|Bro012
me018|so i thought well i'm going to just look at the what actual digit strings do occur in the training data.|S|Bro012
me013|right.|B|Bro012
me018|and the interesting thing was it turns out that there are no sequences of two long or three long digit strings in any of the aurora training data.|S|Bro012
me018|so it's either one four five six.|S|Bro012
me018|uh up to eleven.|S|Bro012
me018|and then it skips.|S|Bro012
me018|and then there's some at sixteen.|S|Bro012
me013|but what about the testing data?|Q|Bro012
me018|um i don't know.|S|Bro012
me018|i didn't look at the test data yet.|S|Bro012
me013|yeah.|S|Bro012
me018|so|F|Bro012
me013|i mean if there's some testing data that has has has two or three|D|Bro012
me018|yeah.|F|Bro012
me018|but i just thought that was a little odd.|S|Bro012
me018|that there were no two or three long|D|Bro012
me018|sorry.|D|Bro012
me018|so i i just for the heck of it i made a little grammar which um you know had it's separate path for each length digit string you could get.|S|Bro012
me018|so there was a one long path.|S|Bro012
me018|and there was a four long and a five long.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me018|and i tried that and it got way worse.|S|Bro012
me018|there were lots of deletions.|S|Bro012
me018|so it was you know i i didn't have any weights of these paths.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me018|or i didn't have anything like that.|S|Bro012
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bro012
me018|and i played with tweaking the word transition penalties a bunch.|S|Bro012
me018|but i couldn't go anywhere.|S|Bro012
me018|but um|F|Bro012
me013|huh.|B|Bro012
me018|i thought well if i only allow|D|Bro012
me018|yeah i guess i should have looked at to see how often there was a mistake where a two long or a three long path was actually put out as a hypothesis.|S|Bro012
me018|um but|F|Bro012
