me011|and we already got the crash out of the way.|S|Bmr016
me011|it did crash so i feel much better earlier.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|interesting.|S|Bmr016
me013|will you get the door?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|huh.|D|Bmr016
me013|and|F|Bmr016
me013|okay|F|Bmr016
me011|okay so um|F|Bmr016
me013|you collected an agenda huh?|S|Bmr016
me011|i did collect an agenda.|S|Bmr016
me011|so i'm going to go first.|S|Bmr016
me011|mwa-ha-ha!|S|Bmr016
me011|it shouldn't take too long.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me011|um so we're pretty much out of digits.|S|Bmr016
me011|we've gone once through the set.|S|Bmr016
me011|um so the only thing i have to do|D|Bmr016
me013|no there's only ten.|S|Bmr016
me011|yeah that's right.|S|Bmr016
me011|so i i just have to go through them.|S|Bmr016
me013|well okay.|S|Bmr016
me011|and uh pick out the ones that have problems.|S|Bmr016
me011|and either correct them or have them reread.|S|Bmr016
me011|so we probably have like four or five more forms to be read to be once through the set.|S|Bmr016
me011|i've also extracted out about an hour's worth.|S|Bmr016
me011|we have about two hours worth.|S|Bmr016
me011|i extracted out about an hour's worth.|S|Bmr016
me011|which are the digits with for which whose speaker have speaker forms.|S|Bmr016
me011|have filled out speaker forms.|S|Bmr016
me011|not everyone's filled out a speaker form.|S|Bmr016
me011|so i extracted one for speakers who have speaker forms.|S|Bmr016
me011|and for meetings in which the key file and the transcript files are parsable.|S|Bmr016
me011|some of the early key files it looks like were done by hand.|S|Bmr016
me011|and so they're not automatically parsable.|S|Bmr016
me011|and i have to go back and fix those.|S|Bmr016
me011|so what that means is we have about an hour of transcribed digits that we can play with.|S|Bmr016
me011|um|F|Bmr016
me013|so you think two you think two hours is the is the total that we have.|S|Bmr016
me011|liz|D|Bmr016
me011|yep.|S|Bmr016
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr016
me013|and you think uh|D|Bmr016
me013|i i didn't quite catch all these different things that are not quite right.|S|Bmr016
me013|but you think we'll be able to retrieve the other hour reasonably?|Q|Bmr016
me011|yes absolutely.|S|Bmr016
me013|okay.|S|Bmr016
me011|so it's just a question of a little hand editing of some files.|S|Bmr016
me011|and then waiting for more people to turn in their speaker forms.|S|Bmr016
me011|i have this web based speaker form.|S|Bmr016
me011|and i sent mail to everyone who hadn't filled out a speaker form.|S|Bmr016
me011|and they're slowly trickling in.|S|Bmr016
me013|so the relevance of the speaker form here|D|Bmr016
me011|it's for labeling the extracted audio files.|S|Bmr016
me013|oh okay.|S|Bmr016
me011|by speaker i.d. and microphone type.|S|Bmr016
me013|wasn't like whether they were giving us permission to use their digits or something.|S|Bmr016
me011|no i spoke with jane about that.|S|Bmr016
me011|and we sort of decided that it's probably not an issue that|D|Bmr016
me011|we edit out any of the errors anyway right?|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me011|so there are no errors in the digits.|S|Bmr016
me011|you'll always read the string correctly.|S|Bmr016
me011|so i can't imagine why anyone would care.|S|Bmr016
me011|so the other topic with digits is uh|D|Bmr016
me011|liz would like to elicit different prosodics.|S|Bmr016
me011|and so we tried last week with them written out in english.|S|Bmr016
me011|and it just didn't work at all.|S|Bmr016
me011|because no one grouped them together.|S|Bmr016
me011|so it just sounded like many many more lines instead of anything else.|S|Bmr016
me011|so in conversations with liz and uh jane we decided that if you wrote them out as numbers instead of words it would elicit more phone number social security number like readings.|S|Bmr016
me011|the problem with that is it becomes numbers instead of digits.|S|Bmr016
me011|when i look at this that first line is sixty one sixty two eighteen eighty six ten.|S|Bmr016
me011|um and so the question is does anyone care?|Q|Bmr016
me011|um i've already spoken with liz and she feels that correct me if i'm wrong that for her connected numbers is fine.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me011|as opposed to connected digits.|S|Bmr016
me011|um i think two hours is probably fine for a test set.|S|Bmr016
me011|but it may be a little short if we actually want to do training and adaptation and all that other stuff.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me013|um do um|F|Bmr016
me013|you want different prosodics.|S|Bmr016
me013|so if you always had the same groupings you wouldn't like that?|Q|Bmr016
me013|is that correct?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|well we actually figured out a way to|D|Bmr016
me011|yeah the the|D|Bmr016
fe016|the the groupings are randomly generated.|S|Bmr016
me013|no but i was asking if that was something you really cared about.|S|Bmr016
me013|because if it wasn't it seems to me if you made it really specifically telephone groupings that maybe people wouldn't uh go and do numbers so much.|S|Bmr016
me013|you know if if it's|D|Bmr016
fe016|i think they may still do it.|S|Bmr016
mn014|uh|D|Bmr016
fe016|um|F|Bmr016
me013|maybe some but probably not so much.|S|Bmr016
me018|what about putting a hyphen between the numbers in the group?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|and|D|Bmr016
me013|right?|Q|Bmr016
me013|so if you if if you have uh|D|Bmr016
me011|six dash one you mean?|Q|Bmr016
me013|if you go six six six uh dash uh two nine three one.|S|Bmr016
fe016|i well okay i it might help|D|Bmr016
fe016|i would like to get away from having only one specific grouping.|S|Bmr016
me013|that's what i was asking yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe016|um so if that's your question.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|but i mean it seems to me that at least for us we can learn to read them as digits.|S|Bmr016
fe016|if that's what people want.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe016|i i'm|D|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|don't think that'd be that hard to read them as single digits.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i agree.|S|Bmr016
fe016|um|F|Bmr016
fe016|and it seems like that might be better for you guys.|S|Bmr016
fe016|since then you'll have just more digit data.|S|Bmr016
me011|right.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and that's always a good thing.|S|Bmr016
fe016|it's a little bit better for me too.|S|Bmr016
me011|yep.|B|Bmr016
fe016|because the digits are easier to recognize.|S|Bmr016
fe016|they're better trained than the numbers.|S|Bmr016
me013|right.|B|Bmr016
me011|so we could just uh put in the instructions read them as digits.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right right read them as single digits.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so sixty one is read as six one.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh.|D|Bmr016
fe016|and if people make a mistake we|D|Bmr016
me011|how about o. versus zero?|Q|Bmr016
me013|i mean the other thing is we could just bag it.|S|Bmr016
me013|because it's it's|D|Bmr016
me013|i'm not worrying about it.|S|Bmr016
me013|i mean because we do have digits training data that we have from uh from o.g.i.|S|Bmr016
me013|i'm sorry.|S|Bmr016
me013|digits numbers training that we have from o.g.i.|S|Bmr016
me013|we've done lots and lots of studies with that.|S|Bmr016
me013|and um|F|Bmr016
fe016|but it's nice to get it in this room with the|D|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe016|i mean for it's|D|Bmr016
me013|no no i guess what i'm saying is that|D|Bmr016
me011|just let them read it how they read it.|S|Bmr016
me013|to some extent maybe we could just read them have them read how how they read it.|S|Bmr016
me013|and it just means that we have to expand our our vocabulary out to stuff that we already have.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right.|B|Bmr016
fe016|well that's fine with me as long as it's just that i didn't want to cause the people who would have been collecting digits the other way to not have the digits.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|so|F|Bmr016
me013|we can go back to the other thing later.|S|Bmr016
me013|i mean we we we've we can do this for awhile.|S|Bmr016
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr016
me013|and then go back to digits for awhile.|S|Bmr016
me013|or um|F|Bmr016
me013|do i mean do you want do you want this do you need training data or adaptation data out of this?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|okay.|B|Bmr016
me013|how much of this do you need?|Q|Bmr016
me013|with uh the|D|Bmr016
fe016|it's actually unclear right now.|S|Bmr016
fe016|i just thought well we're if we're collecting digits and adam had said we were running out of the t.i. forms i thought it'd be nice to have them in groups.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and probably all else being equal it'd be better for me to just have single digits.|S|Bmr016
fe016|since it's you know a recognizer's going to do better on those anyway.|S|Bmr016
me013|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe016|um and it's more predictable.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so we can know from the transcript what the person said and the transcriber in general.|S|Bmr016
me013|okay well if you|D|Bmr016
fe016|but if they make mistakes it's no big deal.|S|Bmr016
fe016|if the people say a hundred instead of one o.o.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and also maybe we can just let them choose zero versus o. as they as they like.|S|Bmr016
fe016|because even the same person sometimes says o. and sometimes says zero in different context.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|and that's sort of interesting.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so i don't have a specific need.|S|Bmr016
fe016|because if i did i'd probably try to collect it you know without bothering this group.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but if we can try it|D|Bmr016
me011|okay so so i can just add to the instructions to read it as digits.|S|Bmr016
me011|not as connected numbers.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right and you can give an example.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|like you know six sixty one would be read as six one.|S|Bmr016
me011|right.|B|Bmr016
fe016|and i think people will get it.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe008|and actually it's no more artificial than what we've been doing with words.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i'm sure people can adapt to this.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right right.|S|Bmr016
fe008|read it single.|S|Bmr016
fe016|it's just easier to read.|S|Bmr016
fe008|the spaces already bias it toward being separated.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right.|B|Bmr016
fe008|and i know i'm going to find this easier than words.|S|Bmr016
me011|oh yeah absolutely.|S|Bmr016
me011|cognitively it's much easier.|S|Bmr016
fe016|i also had a hard hard time with the words.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but then we went back and forth on that.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|okay so let's give that a try.|S|Bmr016
me011|okay and is the spacing all right or do you think there should be more space between digits and groups?|S|Bmr016
me013|okay.|B|Bmr016
fe016|and|F|Bmr016
fe016|i mean what do other people think?|Q|Bmr016
me011|or is that all right?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|because you guys are reading them.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i think that it's fine.|S|Bmr016
fe008|it it to me it looks like you've got the the idea of grouping and you have the the idea of separation.|S|Bmr016
me011|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and you know it's just a matter of the instructions that's all.|S|Bmr016
fe016|great okay.|S|Bmr016
fe016|well let's give it a try.|S|Bmr016
me011|and i think there are about ten different gouping patterns.|S|Bmr016
me013|let's try it.|S|Bmr016
me011|isn't that right liz?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|right and you just they're randomly generated and randomly assigned to digits.|S|Bmr016
me011|that we did.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i did|D|Bmr016
me013|so we have|D|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me013|sorry.|S|Bmr016
fe008|go ahead.|S|Bmr016
me013|i i was just going to say so we have in the vicinity of forty hours of of recordings now.|S|Bmr016
me013|and you're saying two hours uh is digits.|S|Bmr016
me013|so that's roughly the ratio then.|S|Bmr016
me013|something like twenty twenty to one.|S|Bmr016
me011|yep.|S|Bmr016
me013|which i guess makes makes sense.|S|Bmr016
me013|so if we did another forty hours of recordings then we could get another couple hours of this.|S|Bmr016
me011|right.|S|Bmr016
me013|um yeah like you say i think a couple hours for a for a for a test test set's okay.|S|Bmr016
me013|it'd be nice to get you know more later.|S|Bmr016
me013|because we'll we might use use this up uh in some sense.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me013|but but uh|F|Bmr016
me011|right.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah i also would like to argue for that.|S|Bmr016
fe008|because it it seems to me that um there's a real strength in having the same test replicated in a whole bunch of times.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and adding to that basic test bank.|S|Bmr016
me011|right.|B|Bmr016
fe008|huh.|D|Bmr016
fe008|because then you have you know more and more chances to get away from random errors.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and i think um the other thing too is that right now we have sort of a stratified sample with reference to dialect groups.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and it might be there might be an argument to be made for having uh for replicating all of the digits that we've done.|S|Bmr016
fe008|which were done by non native speakers.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so that we have a core that totally replicates the original data set.|S|Bmr016
fe008|which is totally american speakers.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and then we have these stratified additional language groups overlapping certain aspects of the database.|S|Bmr016
me011|right.|B|Bmr016
me011|i think that uh trying to duplicate spending too much effort trying to duplicate the existing t.i. digits probably isn't too worthwhile.|S|Bmr016
me011|because the recording situation is so different.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr016
me011|it's going to be very hard to be comparable.|S|Bmr016
fe008|except that if you have the stimuli comparable then it says something about the the contribution of setting.|S|Bmr016
me013|no it's it's not the same.|S|Bmr016
me013|a little bit.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and|F|Bmr016
me013|but the other differences are so major.|S|Bmr016
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr016
me013|they're such major sources of variance that it's it's it's uh|D|Bmr016
me011|yeah i mean read versus not.|S|Bmr016
fe008|what's an example of a of some of the other differences?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|any other difference?|Q|Bmr016
me013|well individual human glottis is going to be different for each one.|S|Bmr016
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr016
me013|you know it's just there's so many things.|S|Bmr016
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr016
me013|it's it and and enunciation.|S|Bmr016
me011|well and not just that.|S|Bmr016
me011|i mean the uh the corpus itself.|S|Bmr016
me011|i mean we're collecting it in a read digit in a particular list.|S|Bmr016
me011|and i'm sure that they're doing more specific stuff.|S|Bmr016
me011|i mean if i remember correctly it was like postman reading zipcodes and things like that.|S|Bmr016
me013|t.i. digits was?|Q|Bmr016
me013|i thought i thought it was read.|S|Bmr016
me011|i thought so.|S|Bmr016
me011|was it read?|Q|Bmr016
me013|yeah i think the reading zipcode stuff you're thinking of would be o.g.i.|S|Bmr016
me011|oh i may well be.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah no t.i. digits was read in in read in the studio i believe.|S|Bmr016
me011|i haven't ever listened to t.i. digits.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me011|so i don't really know how it compares.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me013|but it but|D|Bmr016
me011|but but regardless it's going to it's hard to compare cross corpus.|S|Bmr016
me013|it's different people is the is the core thing.|S|Bmr016
me011|so|F|Bmr016
me013|and they're different circumstances with different recording environment and so forth.|S|Bmr016
fe008|okay fine.|S|Bmr016
me013|so it's it's it's really pretty different.|S|Bmr016
me013|but i think the idea of using a set thing was just to give you some sort of framework.|S|Bmr016
me013|so that even though you couldn't do exact comparisons it wouldn't be valid scientifically at least it'd give you some kind of uh frame of reference.|S|Bmr016
me013|uh you know it's not|D|Bmr016
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr016
me018|hey liz what what do the groupings represent?|Q|Bmr016
me018|you said there's like ten different groupings.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right just groupings in terms of number of groups in a line.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and number of digits in a group.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and the pattern of groupings.|S|Bmr016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me018|are the patterns like are they based on anything or|D|Bmr016
fe016|um i i just roughly looked at what kinds of digit strings are out there.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and they're usually grouped into either two three or four four digits at a time.|S|Bmr016
me018|oh.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and they can have|D|Bmr016
fe016|i mean actually things are getting longer and longer.|S|Bmr016
fe016|in the old days you probably only had three sequences and telephone numbers were less and so forth.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so there's between um|D|Bmr016
fe016|well if you look at it there are between like three and five groups.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and each one has between two and four groupings.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and|F|Bmr016
fe016|i purposely didn't want them to look like they were in any kind of pattern.|S|Bmr016
me018|huh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|so|F|Bmr016
me011|and which group appears is picked randomly and what the numbers are are picked randomly.|S|Bmr016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|right.|S|Bmr016
me011|so unlike the previous one which i simply replicated t.i. digits this is generated randomly.|S|Bmr016
me018|huh oh okay.|S|Bmr016
mn014|oh okay.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but i think it'd be great to be able to compare digits.|S|Bmr016
fe016|whether it's these digits or t.i. digits to speakers um and compare that to their spontaneous speech.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and then we do need you know a fair amount of of digit data.|S|Bmr016
fe016|because you might be wearing a different microphone.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and i mean so it's it's nice to have the digits you know replicated many times.|S|Bmr016
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|especially for speakers that don't talk a lot.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so um|F|Bmr016
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe016|for adaptation.|S|Bmr016
fe016|no i'm serious.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me011|yeah all we have for some people is digits.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|and we're not using the digit data now.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but you know|D|Bmr016
me011|oh you're not.|S|Bmr016
fe016|not for adaptation nope.|S|Bmr016
fe016|we're not we were running adaptation only on the data that we ran recognition on.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and i'd as soon as someone started to read transcript number that's read speech.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and i thought well we're going to do better on that.|S|Bmr016
me011|oh i see.|S|Bmr016
fe016|that's not fair to use.|S|Bmr016
me011|oh yeah that's true absolutely.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but it might be fair to use the data for adaptation.|S|Bmr016
mn014|okay.|D|Bmr016
fe016|so|F|Bmr016
fe016|so those speakers who are very quiet shy|D|Bmr016
me011|that would be interesting to see whether that helps.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right.|S|Bmr016
me011|do you think that would help adapting on|D|Bmr016
me018|like adam?|Q|Bmr016
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr016
me011|yeah i have a real problem with that.|S|Bmr016
fe016|well it i mean it's the same|D|Bmr016
fe016|see the nice thing is we have that in the in the same meeting.|S|Bmr016
me011|right.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|D|Bmr016
fe016|and so you don't get|D|Bmr016
me011|same same acoustics.|S|Bmr016
me011|same microphone.|S|Bmr016
me011|same channel.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|right and so i still like the idea of having some kind of digit data.|S|Bmr016
me011|okay.|S|Bmr016
me011|good.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah i mean for the for the um acoustic research|D|Bmr016
me013|for the signal processing farfield stuff i see it as as as the place that we start.|S|Bmr016
me013|but i mean it'd be nice to have twenty hours of digits data.|S|Bmr016
me013|but but uh the truth is i'm hoping that we we through the the stuff that that you guys have been doing as you continue that we get uh the best we can do on the spontaneous stuff uh uh nearfield.|S|Bmr016
me013|and then um we do a lot of the testing of the algorithms on the digits for the farfield.|S|Bmr016
me013|and at some point when we feel it's mature and we understand what's going on with it then we we have to move on to the spontaneous data with the farfield.|S|Bmr016
me013|so|F|Bmr016
fe016|the only thing that we don't have|D|Bmr016
fe008|great.|S|Bmr016
fe016|i know this sounds weird.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and maybe it's completely stupid.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but we don't have any overlapping digits.|S|Bmr016
me011|yeah we talked about that a couple times.|S|Bmr016
fe016|i know it's weird.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but um|D|Bmr016
mn014|overlapping digits.|S|Bmr016
me011|the the problem i see with trying to do overlapping digits is the cognitive load.|S|Bmr016
fe016|all right everybody's laughing.|S|Bmr016
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr016
me001|dueling digits.|S|Bmr016
me011|no it's it's not stupid.|S|Bmr016
me011|it's just i mean try to do it.|S|Bmr016
fe016|i'm just for the stuff that like dan ellis is going to try.|S|Bmr016
me011|i mean here let's try it.|S|Bmr016
fe016|you know cross talk cancellation.|S|Bmr016
me013|let's try it.|S|Bmr016
me011|you read the last line i'll read the first line.|S|Bmr016
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr016
mn014|oh.|D|Bmr016
fe016|wait oh it these are all the same forms.|S|Bmr016
me013|sixty one.|S|Bmr016
fe016|okay so but|D|Bmr016
me011|so so you read the last line i'll read the first line.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so you you plug your ears.|S|Bmr016
me013|no i'll|D|Bmr016
me011|oh i guess if you plug you're ears you could do it.|S|Bmr016
me011|but then you don't get the the same effects.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|well what i mean is actually not the overlaps that are well governed linguistically.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but the actual fact that there is speech coming from two people.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and the beam forming|D|Bmr016
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|all the acoustic stuff that like dan ellis and and company want to do.|S|Bmr016
me011|oh i see.|S|Bmr016
fe016|digits are nice and well behaved.|S|Bmr016
fe016|i mean|F|Bmr016
fe016|anyway it's just a thought.|S|Bmr016
me011|i guess we could try.|S|Bmr016
me011|we could try doing some.|S|Bmr016
fe016|it it would go faster.|S|Bmr016
me018|parallel.|S|Bmr016
fe016|it would take one around amount of|D|Bmr016
me018|it's the p. make of digit reading.|S|Bmr016
me011|well well okay well let's try it.|S|Bmr016
fe016|that's right.|S|Bmr016
fe016|i i i'm i was sort of serious.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but i really i mean i'm i don't feel strongly enough that it's a good idea.|S|Bmr016
me013|see|D|Bmr016
me011|you do the last line i'll do the first line.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so|F|Bmr016
me013|okay.|S|Bmr016
me011|that's not bad.|S|Bmr016
me013|no i can do it.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and that prosody was great by the way.|S|Bmr016
me018|i couldn't understand a single thing you guys were saying.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i think it was numbers.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but i'm not sure.|S|Bmr016
fe016|it it sort of sounded like a duet or something.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me018|performance art.|S|Bmr016
me013|all right let's try three at once you you pick one in the middle.|S|Bmr016
mn014|the aurora theater.|S|Bmr016
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr016
me013|go.|S|Bmr016
fe016|i'm sorry.|S|Bmr016
fe016|i'm mean i think it's doable.|S|Bmr016
me011|the poor transcribers.|S|Bmr016
fe016|i'm just|D|Bmr016
me011|they're going to hate us.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so we we could have a round like where you do two at a time.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and then the next person picks up when the first guy's done or something.|S|Bmr016
mn014|so pairwise.|S|Bmr016
me013|oh like a round.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah like in a a|D|Bmr016
fe016|like a|D|Bmr016
mn014|yeah just pairwise.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|F|Bmr016
fe016|what do you call it?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|a like|D|Bmr016
me011|a round.|S|Bmr016
mn014|or|D|Bmr016
me013|row row row your boat.|S|Bmr016
me001|round.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah like that.|S|Bmr016
me013|okay.|S|Bmr016
me018|it's going to require some coordination.|S|Bmr016
fe016|then it would go like twice as fast or a third as fast.|S|Bmr016
fe016|anyway it's just a thought.|S|Bmr016
fe008|you have to have a similar pace.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|i'm actually sort of serious if it would help people do that kind|D|Bmr016
fe016|but the people who want to work on it we should talk to them.|S|Bmr016
me013|i don't think we're going to collect vast amounts of data that way.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so|F|Bmr016
me011|huh.|D|Bmr016
me013|but i think having a little bit might at least be fun for somebody like dan to play around with.|S|Bmr016
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr016
me011|i think maybe if we wanted to do that we would do it as a separate session.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr016
me011|something like that.|S|Bmr016
me011|rather than doing it during a real meeting.|S|Bmr016
me011|and you know do two people at a time.|S|Bmr016
me011|then three people at a time and things like that.|S|Bmr016
me011|so|F|Bmr016
fe016|can try it out.|S|Bmr016
fe016|if we have nothing if we have no agenda we could do it some week.|S|Bmr016
me011|see see what dan thinks.|S|Bmr016
me011|yeah right.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr016
me013|spend the whole time reading digits with different quantities.|S|Bmr016
fe008|can can i have another another question about this?|Q|Bmr016
me011|i thought this was going to be fast.|S|Bmr016
me011|oh well.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so um there are these digits.|S|Bmr016
fe008|which are detached digits.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but there are other words that contain the same general phoneme sequences.|S|Bmr016
fe008|like wonderful has one in it.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and and victor borge had a had a piece on this where he inflated the digits.|S|Bmr016
fe008|well i wonder if there's um if there would be a value in having digits that are in essence embedded in real words to compare in terms of like the articulation of one in wonderful versus one as a digit being read.|S|Bmr016
me013|that's two bad.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|i'm all four it.|S|Bmr016
fe008|there you go.|S|Bmr016
me011|not after i eight though.|S|Bmr016
me013|uh they don't all work as well do they?|S|Bmr016
me013|huh.|B|Bmr016
me013|what does nine work in?|Q|Bmr016
me011|uh|F|Bmr016
me013|uh|F|Bmr016
me001|nein!|S|Bmr016
me001|you scream it.|S|Bmr016
me011|nein.|S|Bmr016
me013|oh in german.|S|Bmr016
me011|you have to be german.|S|Bmr016
me018|it's great for the germans.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr016
mn014|that's german yeah.|D|Bmr016
fe016|oh oh.|S|Bmr016
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|nein.|S|Bmr016
me013|that's right.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me011|oh.|B|Bmr016
me001|it only sounds good when you scream it though.|S|Bmr016
me001|so|F|Bmr016
me013|i think everybody's a little punchy here today.|S|Bmr016
fe008|well i mean i just wanted to offer that as a possible task.|S|Bmr016
me013|yes.|S|Bmr016
fe008|because you know if we were to each read his embedded numbers words in in sentences.|S|Bmr016
fe008|because it's like an entire sketch he does.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and i wouldn't take the inflated version.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so he talks about the woman being two-derful.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and|F|Bmr016
fe008|and but you know if it were to be deflated just the normal word it would be like a little story that we could read.|S|Bmr016
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe008|i don't know if it would be useful for comparison.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but it's embedded numbers.|S|Bmr016
me013|well i don't know.|S|Bmr016
me011|i think for something like that we'd be better off doing like uh timit.|S|Bmr016
me013|well i think the question is what the research is.|S|Bmr016
me013|so i mean i presume that the reason that you wanted to have these digits this way is because you wanted to actually do some research looking at the prosodic form here.|S|Bmr016
me011|huh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|right yeah.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah okay.|S|Bmr016
me013|so if somebody wanted to do that if they wanted to look at the the the difference of the uh phones in the digits in the context of a word versus uh the digits a a non digit word versus in digit word uh that would be a good thing to do.|S|Bmr016
me013|but i think someone would have to express interest in that.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i see.|S|Bmr016
me013|i think to|D|Bmr016
fe008|okay.|B|Bmr016
me013|i mean if you were interested in it then we could do it for instance.|S|Bmr016
fe008|okay thank you.|S|Bmr016
fe008|huh.|B|Bmr016
me011|okay are we done with digits?|Q|Bmr016
me011|um|F|Bmr016
me011|we have a.s.r. results from liz.|S|Bmr016
me011|transcript status from jane.|S|Bmr016
me011|and disk space and storage formats from don.|S|Bmr016
me011|does do we have any preference on which way we want to we want to go?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|well i was actually going to skip the a.s.r. results part in favor of getting the transcription stuff talked about.|S|Bmr016
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|since i think that's more important to moving forward.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but i mean morgan has this paper copy.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and if people have questions|D|Bmr016
fe016|um it's pretty preliminary in terms of a.s.r. results.|S|Bmr016
fe016|because we didn't do anything fancy.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but i think just having the results there.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and pointing out some main conclusions.|S|Bmr016
fe016|like it's not the speaking style that differs.|S|Bmr016
fe016|it's the fact that there's overlap that causes recognition errors.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and then the fact that it's almost all insertion errors.|S|Bmr016
fe016|which you would expect.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but you might also think that in the overlapped regions you would get substitutions and so forth.|S|Bmr016
fe016|um leads us to believe that doing a better segmentation like your channel based segmentation or some kind of uh echo cancellation to get basically back down to the individual speaker utterances would be probably all that we would need to be able to do good recognition on the on the close talking mikes.|S|Bmr016
me011|um why don't you if you have a hard copy why don't you email it to the list?|Q|Bmr016
mn014|so these|D|Bmr016
fe016|so that's about the summary.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but this is morgan has this paper.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|i mean he he|D|Bmr016
me013|yeah so it's the same thing?|S|Bmr016
me011|oh it's in the paper.|S|Bmr016
fe016|it it's that paper.|S|Bmr016
me013|it's the same thing i mailed to everybody that where it was.|S|Bmr016
me011|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so we basically um did a lot of work on that.|S|Bmr016
me011|okay then it's already been mailed.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|D|Bmr016
fe016|and it's|D|Bmr016
fe016|let's see|D|Bmr016
fe016|i guess the other neat thing is it shows for sure that the lapel you know within speaker is bad.|S|Bmr016
me011|horrible?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|and it's bad because it picks up the overlapping speech.|S|Bmr016
mn014|so your your a.s.r. results were run on the channels synchronized.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yes because that's all that had been transcribed at the time.|S|Bmr016
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr016
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr016
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe016|um|F|Bmr016
fe016|but as we i mean i wanted to here more about the transcription.|S|Bmr016
fe016|if we can get the channel asynchronous or the|D|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|the closer|D|Bmr016
fe016|that would be very interesting for us.|S|Bmr016
fe016|because we|D|Bmr016
me018|so if|D|Bmr016
me013|yeah that's that's why i only used the part from.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me013|which we had uh about uh about the over all the channels.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|right.|B|Bmr016
fe016|that's|D|Bmr016
mn014|yeah sure.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me013|or mixed channel.|S|Bmr016
me013|rather mixed signal.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me018|so if there was a segment of speech this long|D|Bmr016
fe016|because|D|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me011|and someone said oh in the front in the middle.|S|Bmr016
me018|and oh and someone said oh the whole thing was passed to the recognizer.|S|Bmr016
mn014|there were several speakers in it.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|that's right in fact i i pulled out a couple classic examples in case you want to use them in your talk of|D|Bmr016
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me018|that's why there's so many insertion errors.|S|Bmr016
fe016|chuck on the lapel.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so chuck wore the lapel three out of four times.|S|Bmr016
me001|huh.|B|Bmr016
me011|i noticed that chuck was wearing the lapel a lot.|S|Bmr016
fe016|um yeah.|S|Bmr016
me018|early on yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and i wore the lapel once.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and for me the lapel was okay.|S|Bmr016
fe016|i mean i still|D|Bmr016
fe016|and i don't know why.|S|Bmr016
fe016|i'm|D|Bmr016
fe016|but um|F|Bmr016
fe016|for you it was|D|Bmr016
me011|probably how you wear it wore it i would guess.|S|Bmr016
fe016|or who was next to me or something like that.|S|Bmr016
me001|yeah where you were sitting probably affected it.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|right but when chuck wore the lapel and morgan was talking there're a couple really long utterances.|S|Bmr016
fe016|where chuck is saying a few things inside.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and it's picking up all of morgan's words pretty well.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and so the you know there're error rates|D|Bmr016
fe016|because of insertion|D|Bmr016
fe016|insertions aren't bounded.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so with a one word utterance and ten insertions you know you got huge error rate.|S|Bmr016
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|and that's that's where the problems come in.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so this is sort of what we expected.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but it's nice to be able to to show it.|S|Bmr016
me011|right.|B|Bmr016
fe016|and also i just wanted to mention briefly that um uh andreas and i called up dan ellis who's still stuck in switzerland.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and we were going to ask him if if there're you know what's out there in terms of echo cancellation and things like that.|S|Bmr016
fe016|not that we were going to do it.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but we wanted to know what would need to be done.|S|Bmr016
me011|and he said lots lots lots lots.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and he we've given him the data we have so far.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so these sychronous cases where there are overlap.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yep.|B|Bmr016
fe016|and he's going to look into trying to run some things that are out there.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and see how well it can do.|S|Bmr016
fe016|because right now we're not able to actually report on recognition in a real paper.|S|Bmr016
me018|so|F|Bmr016
fe016|like a eurospeech paper.|S|Bmr016
fe016|because it would look sort of premature.|S|Bmr016
me018|so|F|Bmr016
me018|so the idea is that you would take this big hunk where somebody's only speaking a small amount in it.|S|Bmr016
me018|and then try to figure out where they're speaking based on the other|D|Bmr016
fe016|right or who's at any point in time who's the foreground speaker.|S|Bmr016
fe016|who's the background speaker.|S|Bmr016
me018|i thought we were just going to move the boundaries in.|S|Bmr016
mn014|so yeah|D|Bmr016
fe016|so|F|Bmr016
mn014|yeah should it|D|Bmr016
me011|well that's with the hand stuff.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so there's like|D|Bmr016
me011|but how would you do that automatically?|Q|Bmr016
me018|right.|S|Bmr016
mn014|uh i've actually done some experiments with cross correlation.|S|Bmr016
fe016|well there's|D|Bmr016
mn014|and it seems to work pretty well to to get rid of those those overlaps.|S|Bmr016
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me011|i mean that's the sort of thing that you would do.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|yeah exactly so it's it's a|D|Bmr016
me011|so|F|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me018|so why do you want to do echo cancellation?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|um it would be techniques used from adaptive adaptive echo cancellation.|S|Bmr016
fe016|which i don't know enough about to talk about.|S|Bmr016
me018|uhhuh.|S|Bmr016
me013|it just it just to to remove cross talk.|S|Bmr016
fe016|um|F|Bmr016
fe016|but|F|Bmr016
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|right um and that would be similar to what you're also trying to do.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but using um you know more than energy.|S|Bmr016
fe016|i i don't know what exactly would go into it.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
mn014|yeah sure.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so the idea is to basically run this on the whole meeting.|S|Bmr016
me018|so it would be|D|Bmr016
fe016|and get the locations which gives you also the time boundaries of the individual|D|Bmr016
me018|okay.|S|Bmr016
me018|so do sort of what he's already what he's trying to do.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right except that there are many techniques for the kinds of cues um that you can use to do that.|S|Bmr016
me018|okay i i see.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah in another way.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me018|i see.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah dave dave uh is um also going to be playing around with echo cancellation for the nearfield farfield stuff.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so|F|Bmr016
me013|so we'll be|D|Bmr016
fe016|and i guess espen.|S|Bmr016
fe016|this is uh is he here too?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|may also be working|D|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so it would just be|D|Bmr016
fe016|that's really the next step.|S|Bmr016
fe016|because we can't do too much you know on in terms of recognition results knowing that this is a big problem.|S|Bmr016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|um until we can do that kind of processing.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and so once we have some some of yours.|S|Bmr016
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah i'm working on it.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and we'll move on.|S|Bmr016
me018|i think this also ties into one of the things that jane is going to talk about too.|S|Bmr016
me011|um|F|Bmr016
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh.|S|Bmr016
me011|i also wanted to say i have done all this chopping up of digits.|S|Bmr016
me011|so i have some naming conventions that we should try to agree on.|S|Bmr016
fe016|oh right.|S|Bmr016
me011|so let's do that off line.|S|Bmr016
me011|we don't need to do it during the meeting.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right.|S|Bmr016
me001|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe016|definitely|D|Bmr016
fe016|uh and don should|D|Bmr016
me011|and and i have scripts that will extract it out from key files.|S|Bmr016
me011|and and do all the naming automatically.|S|Bmr016
fe016|okay.|B|Bmr016
me011|so you don't have to do it by hand.|S|Bmr016
me001|all right.|S|Bmr016
fe016|great.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so that's it for the|D|Bmr016
me001|you've compiled the list of uh speaker names.|S|Bmr016
fe016|speakers and|D|Bmr016
me011|uhhuh.|S|Bmr016
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr016
me001|not names.|S|Bmr016
me001|but i.d.'s.|S|Bmr016
me011|yep.|S|Bmr016
me011|yeah names names in the names to i.d.'s.|S|Bmr016
me011|so you|D|Bmr016
me001|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe016|great.|S|Bmr016
me011|and it does all sorts of matches.|S|Bmr016
me011|because the way people filled out names is different on every single file.|S|Bmr016
me011|so it does a very fuzzy sort of match.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right.|B|Bmr016
me001|cool.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so at this point we can sort of finalize the naming and so forth.|S|Bmr016
me011|yep.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and we're going to basically rewrite out these waveforms that we did.|S|Bmr016
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|because as you notice in the paper your m.o. four in one meeting.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and m.o. two in another meeting.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and it's we just need to standardize the|D|Bmr016
me001|yeah.|S|Bmr016
me001|that was my fault.|S|Bmr016
fe016|um|F|Bmr016
fe016|no it's it's|D|Bmr016
me013|no i didn't notice that actually.|S|Bmr016
fe016|um that's why those comments are are in there.|S|Bmr016
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me011|yep.|B|Bmr016
me001|then disregard it then.|S|Bmr016
me011|so i now have a script that you can just say basically look up morgan.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so|F|Bmr016
fe016|right.|B|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|okay.|B|Bmr016
me011|and it will give you his i.d.|S|Bmr016
fe016|great great.|S|Bmr016
me001|okay.|S|Bmr016
me011|so|F|Bmr016
fe016|terrific.|S|Bmr016
me011|um|F|Bmr016
me011|all right.|S|Bmr016
me011|do we|D|Bmr016
me011|don you had disk space and storage formats?|Q|Bmr016
me011|is that something we need to talk about at the meeting?|Q|Bmr016
me011|or should you just talk with chuck at some other time?|Q|Bmr016
me001|um i had some general questions just about the compression algorithms of shortening waveforms.|S|Bmr016
me001|and i don't know exactly who to ask.|S|Bmr016
me001|i thought that maybe you would be the the person to talk to.|S|Bmr016
me001|so is it a lossless compression when you compress|D|Bmr016
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me001|so|D|Bmr016
me011|entropy coding.|S|Bmr016
me001|it just uses entropy coding?|Q|Bmr016
me011|so|F|Bmr016
me001|okay.|S|Bmr016
me001|so i mean i guess my question would be is|D|Bmr016
me001|i just got this new eighteen gig drive installed.|S|Bmr016
me001|um yeah.|F|Bmr016
me001|which is|D|Bmr016
me011|and i assume half of it is scratch and half of it is|D|Bmr016
me001|i'm not exactly sure how they partitioned it.|S|Bmr016
me011|probably yeah.|S|Bmr016
me001|but um|F|Bmr016
me013|that's typical huh.|S|Bmr016
me001|yeah i don't know what's typical here.|S|Bmr016
me001|but um|F|Bmr016
me001|it's local though.|S|Bmr016
me001|so|F|Bmr016
me011|that doesn't matter.|S|Bmr016
me001|but|D|Bmr016
me011|you can access it from anywhere in icsi.|S|Bmr016
me001|okay.|S|Bmr016
me013|in fact this is an eighteen gig drive or is it a thirty six gig drive with eighteen|D|Bmr016
me001|all right.|S|Bmr016
me001|how do you do that?|Q|Bmr016
me011|n.|D|Bmr016
me001|eighteen.|S|Bmr016
fe016|eighteen.|S|Bmr016
fe016|it was a spare that dave had around.|S|Bmr016
me013|oh okay.|S|Bmr016
me011|slash n. slash machine name slash x.a. in all likelihood.|S|Bmr016
me001|oh i see.|S|Bmr016
me001|okay.|S|Bmr016
me001|all right i did know that.|S|Bmr016
me011|um so the the only question is how much of it|D|Bmr016
me011|the distinction between scratch and non scratch is whether it's backed up or not.|S|Bmr016
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me001|right.|B|Bmr016
me011|so what you want to do is use the scratch for stuff that you can regenerate.|S|Bmr016
me001|okay.|S|Bmr016
me011|so|F|Bmr016
me011|the stuff that isn't backed up is not a big deal.|S|Bmr016
me011|because disks don't crash very frequently.|S|Bmr016
me001|right.|B|Bmr016
me011|as long as you can regenerate it.|S|Bmr016
me001|right.|B|Bmr016
fe016|yeah it's|D|Bmr016
me001|i mean all of this stuff can be regenerated.|S|Bmr016
me001|it's just a question|D|Bmr016
fe016|well the|D|Bmr016
me011|then put it all on scratch.|S|Bmr016
me011|because we're icsi is is bottlenecked by backup.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh very good point.|S|Bmr016
me001|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe016|well i'd leave all the all the transcript stuff shouldn't should be backed up.|S|Bmr016
me011|so we want to put|D|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|but all the waveform sound files should not be backed up.|S|Bmr016
me001|yeah i guess|D|Bmr016
me001|right.|S|Bmr016
fe016|the ones that you write out.|S|Bmr016
me001|okay.|S|Bmr016
me001|so i mean i guess the other question was then should we shorten them downsample them or keep them in their original form?|Q|Bmr016
me001|um|F|Bmr016
me011|it just depends on your tools.|S|Bmr016
me011|i mean because it's not backed up and it's just on scratch if your tools can't take shortened format i would leave them expanded.|S|Bmr016
me001|right.|B|Bmr016
me011|so you don't have to unshorten them every single time you want to do anything.|S|Bmr016
me001|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe016|we can downsample them.|S|Bmr016
me001|do you think that'd be okay?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|so|F|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr016
me001|to downsample them.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah we get the same performance.|S|Bmr016
me001|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe016|i mean the the front end on the s.r.i. recognizer just downsamples them on the fly.|S|Bmr016
me001|yeah i guess the only argument against downsampling is to preserve just the original files in case we want to experiment with different filtering techniques.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so|F|Bmr016
fe016|so that's|D|Bmr016
me013|i i i'm sorry|F|Bmr016
fe016|yeah if|D|Bmr016
me013|yeah i mean over all our data we we want to not downsample.|S|Bmr016
fe016|you'd you want to not|D|Bmr016
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so we're what we're doing is we're writing out|D|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|i mean this is just a question.|S|Bmr016
fe016|we're writing out these individual segments that wherever there's a time boundary from thilo or or jane's transcribers you know we we chop it there.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me013|uhhuh.|D|Bmr016
fe016|and the reason is so that we can feed it to the recognizer.|S|Bmr016
me013|uhhuh.|D|Bmr016
fe016|and throw out ones that we're not using and so forth.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|and those are the ones that we're storing.|S|Bmr016
me011|yeah as i said since that's it's regeneratable what i would do is take downsample it.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so|F|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me011|and compress it however you're the s.r.i. recognizer wants to take it in.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|so we can't shorten them.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but we can downsample them.|S|Bmr016
me001|right.|B|Bmr016
me013|yeah i mean|D|Bmr016
me013|yeah i'm sorry.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so|F|Bmr016
me013|as yeah as long as there is a a form that we can come from again that is not downsampled then|D|Bmr016
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|oh yeah|D|Bmr016
me001|yeah those are going to be kept.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe016|that that's why we need more disk space.|S|Bmr016
me013|uuu|F|Bmr016
fe016|because we're basically duplicating the originals um|D|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me013|then it's fine.|S|Bmr016
me011|right.|B|Bmr016
me013|but for for future research we'll be doing it with different microphone positions and so on.|S|Bmr016
fe016|oh yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe016|no we always have the original long ones.|S|Bmr016
me011|yep.|B|Bmr016
me001|right.|B|Bmr016
me013|we would like to|D|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me018|so the s.r.i. front end won't take a uh an an a large audio file name and then a a list of segments to chop out from that large audio file?|Q|Bmr016
me018|they actually have to be chopped out already.|S|Bmr016
fe016|um it's better if they're chopped out.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and and it it will be|D|Bmr016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|yeah we could probably write something to do that.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but it's actually convenient to have them chopped out.|S|Bmr016
fe016|because you can run them you know in different orders.|S|Bmr016
fe016|you you can actually move them around.|S|Bmr016
me011|and that's the whole point about the naming conventions.|S|Bmr016
fe016|uh you can get rid|D|Bmr016
me011|is that you could run all the english speaking.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah it's a lot faster.|S|Bmr016
me011|all the native speakers.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right you can grab everything with the word the in it.|S|Bmr016
me011|and all the non native speakers.|S|Bmr016
me011|and all the men and all the women.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and it's|D|Bmr016
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|that's a lot quicker than actually trying to access the wavefile each time.|S|Bmr016
fe016|find the time boundaries and|D|Bmr016
fe016|so in principle yeah you could do that.|S|Bmr016
me018|i don't i don't think that's really right.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but it's|D|Bmr016
fe016|but it's um|D|Bmr016
me011|that's just not right man.|S|Bmr016
fe016|these are long these are long|D|Bmr016
me011|the the point|D|Bmr016
me011|so so for example what if you wanted to run run all the native speakers?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|you know|F|Bmr016
fe016|this is an hour of speech.|S|Bmr016
me011|right so if if you did it that way you would have to generate a program that looks in the database somewhere.|S|Bmr016
me011|extracts out the language.|S|Bmr016
me011|finds the time marks for that particular one.|S|Bmr016
me011|do it that way.|S|Bmr016
me011|the way they're doing it you have that already extracted.|S|Bmr016
me011|and it's embedded in the file name.|S|Bmr016
me011|and so you know you just say|D|Bmr016
fe016|yeah that's so that's part of it.|S|Bmr016
me011|so you just say you know asterisk e. asterisk dot wave and you get what you want.|S|Bmr016
fe016|is|D|Bmr016
fe016|right.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and the other part is just that once they're written out it it is a lot faster to to process them.|S|Bmr016
me011|rather than doing seeks through the file.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so|F|Bmr016
fe016|otherwise you're just accessing|D|Bmr016
me011|this is all just temporary access.|S|Bmr016
me011|so i don't i think it's all just|D|Bmr016
me011|it's fine.|S|Bmr016
me011|you know.|S|Bmr016
me011|fine to do it however is convenient.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right.|S|Bmr016
me013|i mean it just depends how big the file is.|S|Bmr016
me013|if the file sits in memory you can do extremely fast seeks.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right.|B|Bmr016
fe016|the other thing is that believe it or not i mean we have some|D|Bmr016
me013|but|F|Bmr016
me011|yeah and they don't.|S|Bmr016
me011|two gig.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so we're also looking at these in waves like for the alignments and so forth.|S|Bmr016
fe016|you can't load an hour of speech into x. waves.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|you need to have these small files.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and in fact even for the transcriber program um|D|Bmr016
me011|yes you can.|S|Bmr016
me018|yeah you you can give waves a start and an end time.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah if you try to load really long waveform into x. waves you'll be waiting there for|D|Bmr016
me018|and middle.|S|Bmr016
me018|no i i'm not suggesting you load a long wave file.|S|Bmr016
fe016|oh.|S|Bmr016
me018|i'm just saying you give it a start and an end time.|S|Bmr016
me018|and it'll just go and pull out that section.|S|Bmr016
me011|i|D|Bmr016
me011|the transcribers didn't have any problem with that.|S|Bmr016
me011|did they jane?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|what's in what respect?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|loading the long|D|Bmr016
me011|they loaded they loaded the long long files into x. waves.|S|Bmr016
mn014|no with the transcriber tool it's no problem.|S|Bmr016
fe016|it takes a very long|D|Bmr016
fe008|in the|D|Bmr016
mn014|yeah just to load a transcription.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|right.|S|Bmr016
fe016|it takes a very long time.|S|Bmr016
mn014|takes a long time.|S|Bmr016
mn014|but not for the wavefile.|S|Bmr016
mn014|the wavefile is there immediately.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh yeah.|S|Bmr016
me011|are you talking about transcriber or x. waves?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|huh.|D|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr016
mn014|oh i'm talking about transcriber.|S|Bmr016
fe016|actually you're talking about transcriber right?|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe008|it was also true of the digits task which was x. waves.|S|Bmr016
me011|because because we used x. waves to do the digits.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me011|and they were loading the full mixed files then.|S|Bmr016
fe008|very quickly.|S|Bmr016
me011|and it didn't seem to be any problem.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i agree.|S|Bmr016
fe016|huh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|well we we have a problem with that.|S|Bmr016
fe016|you know time wise on a|D|Bmr016
fe016|it's a lot slower to load in a long file.|S|Bmr016
me011|huh.|B|Bmr016
me011|seemed really fast.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and also to check the file.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so if you have a transcript um|D|Bmr016
me011|well regardless it's|D|Bmr016
fe016|i mean it's|D|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|i i think overall you could get everything to work by accessing the same waveform and trying to find two you know the begin and end times.|S|Bmr016
fe016|um|F|Bmr016
fe016|but i think it's more efficient if we have the storage space to have the small ones.|S|Bmr016
me011|and it's no problem right?|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah it's|D|Bmr016
me011|because it's not backed up.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe016|it's it's just|D|Bmr016
me011|so we just|D|Bmr016
me011|if we don't have a spare disk sitting around we go out and we buy ourselves an eighty gigabyte drive.|S|Bmr016
me011|and make it all scratch space.|S|Bmr016
me011|you know it's not a big deal.|S|Bmr016
fe008|you're right about the backup being a bottleneck.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right.|B|Bmr016
fe008|it's good to think towards scratch.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah so these wouldn't be backed up the|D|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr016
me013|yep.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right.|B|Bmr016
me011|so remind me afterward.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and|D|Bmr016
me011|and i'll and we'll look at your disk and see where to put stuff.|S|Bmr016
me001|okay all right.|S|Bmr016
me001|i mean i could just do a d.u. on it right?|S|Bmr016
me001|and just see which how much is on each.|S|Bmr016
me011|yep.|S|Bmr016
me001|so|F|Bmr016
me011|each partition.|S|Bmr016
me011|and you want to use either x.a. or scratch.|S|Bmr016
me001|okay.|S|Bmr016
me011|well x. question mark.|S|Bmr016
me011|anything starting with x. is scratch.|S|Bmr016
me001|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe008|with two two digits.|S|Bmr016
me011|two digits right.|S|Bmr016
me011|x.a.x.b.x.c.|S|Bmr016
me013|so|F|Bmr016
me011|okay?|Q|Bmr016
me011|jane?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|okay so i got a little printout here.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so three on this side.|S|Bmr016
fe008|three on this side.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and i stapled them.|S|Bmr016
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe008|all right so first of all um there was a an interest in the transcription uh checking procedures.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and and i can tell you first uh to go through the steps.|S|Bmr016
fe008|although you've probably seen them.|S|Bmr016
fe008|um as you might imagine when you're dealing with um really a fair number of words and uh natural speech|D|Bmr016
fe008|which means self repairs and all these other factors that there're lots of things to be um standardized and streamlined and checked on.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and um so|F|Bmr016
fe008|i did a bunch of checks.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and the first thing i did was obviously a spell check.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and at that point i discovered certain things.|S|Bmr016
fe008|like um accommodate with one m. .|S|Bmr016
fe008|that kind of thing.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and then in addition to that i did an exhaustive listing of the forms in the data file.|S|Bmr016
fe008|which included detecting things like faulty punctuation and things.|S|Bmr016
me018|i'm i'm sorry to interrupt.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah?|Q|Bmr016
me018|you could could i just back up a little bit?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|sure please.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah please please.|S|Bmr016
me018|and|D|Bmr016
fe008|yeah yeah yeah.|S|Bmr016
me018|so you're doing these so the whole process is that the transcribers get the conversation.|S|Bmr016
me018|and they do their pass over it.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yes.|S|Bmr016
me018|and then when they're finished with it it comes to you.|S|Bmr016
me018|and you begin these these quality checks.|S|Bmr016
fe008|that's right.|S|Bmr016
fe008|exactly.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i do these checks.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Bmr016
me018|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe008|exactly.|S|Bmr016
me018|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|thank you.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and so uh i do a an exhaustive listing of the forms|D|Bmr016
fe008|actually i will go through this in in order.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so if if we could maybe wait and stick keep that for a second.|S|Bmr016
fe008|because we're not ready for that.|S|Bmr016
me011|so on the fifth page seven down|D|Bmr016
fe008|yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly exactly.|S|Bmr016
fe008|all right so a spelling check first.|S|Bmr016
fe008|then an exhaustive listing of the uh all the forms in the data with the punctuation attached.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and at that point i pick up things like oh you know word followed by two commas.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and and then another check involves uh being sure that every utterance has an identifiable speaker.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and if not then that gets checked.|S|Bmr016
fe008|then there's this issue of glossing so-called spoken forms.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so there|D|Bmr016
fe008|for the most part we're keeping it standard word level transcription.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but there's|D|Bmr016
fe008|and that's done with the assumption that pronunciation variants can be handled.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so for things like and the fact that someone doesn't say the d. uh that's not important enough to capture in the transcription.|S|Bmr016
fe008|because a a good pronunciation uh you know model would be able to handle that.|S|Bmr016
fe008|however things like because where you're lacking an entire very prominent first syllable.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and furthermore it's a form that's specific to spoken language.|S|Bmr016
fe008|those are reasons for those reasons i i kept that separate.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and used the convention of using c.u.z. for that form.|S|Bmr016
fe008|however glossing it.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so that it's possible with the script to plug in the full orthographic form for that one.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and a couple of others.|S|Bmr016
fe008|not many.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so want to is another one.|S|Bmr016
fe008|going uh going to is another one.|S|Bmr016
fe008|with just the assumption again that this these are things which it's not really fair to consider expect that a pronunciation model to handle.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and chuck you you indicated that because is is one of those that's handled in a different way also didn't you?|S|Bmr016
fe008|did i|D|Bmr016
me018|i don't remember.|S|Bmr016
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so it might not have been it might not have been you.|S|Bmr016
me018|huh.|B|Bmr016
fe008|but someone told me that in fact because is treated differently in um in this context.|S|Bmr016
fe008|because of that reason that um it's a little bit farther than a pronunciation variant.|S|Bmr016
fe008|okay so after that|D|Bmr016
fe008|let's see.|S|Bmr016
fe008|um|F|Bmr016
me018|so that was part of the spell check or was that that was after the spell check?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|well so when i get the|D|Bmr016
fe008|so the spell check picks up those words.|S|Bmr016
fe008|because they're not in the dictionary.|S|Bmr016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe008|so it gets because and want to and that|D|Bmr016
me011|and then you gloss them?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|yeah uhhuh.|S|Bmr016
fe008|run it through|D|Bmr016
fe008|i have a sed you know so i do sed script saying whenever you see going to you know convert it to going to you know gloss equals quote going to quote.|S|Bmr016
fe008|you know.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and with all these things being in curly brackets.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so they're always distinctive.|S|Bmr016
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe008|okay i also wrote a script which will um retrieve anything in curly brackets or anything which i've classified as an acronym.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and a pronounced acronym.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and the way i tag pronounced acronyms is that i have underscores between the components.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so if it's a.c.l. then it's a. underscore c. underscore l. .|S|Bmr016
fe008|and the|D|Bmr016
me011|and so so your list here are these ones that actually occurred in the meetings?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|yes uhhuh yeah.|S|Bmr016
me011|whew!|S|Bmr016
fe008|okay so now uh and|D|Bmr016
me011|we are acronym loaded.|S|Bmr016
fe016|um can i ask a question about the glossing uh before we go on?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so for a word like because is it that it's always predictably because?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|i mean is c.u.z. always meaning because?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|yes but not the reverse.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so sometimes people will say because in the meeting.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and if if they actually said because then it's written as because with no|S|Bmr016
fe008|because doesn't even figure into the equation.|S|Bmr016
fe016|because|D|Bmr016
me013|but but in our meetings people don't say hey because how you doing.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right right.|S|Bmr016
me011|except right there.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe016|um so i guess so from the point of view of|D|Bmr016
fe008|that's a good point.|S|Bmr016
fe016|the the only problem is that with for the recognition we we map it to because.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and so if we know that c.u.z.|S|Bmr016
me011|well|D|Bmr016
fe008|that's fine.|S|Bmr016
fe008|well don has a script.|S|Bmr016
me011|but they have the gloss.|S|Bmr016
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|but we don't|D|Bmr016
me011|you have the gloss form.|S|Bmr016
me011|so you always replace it.|S|Bmr016
fe008|exactly.|S|Bmr016
me011|if that's how what you want to do.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe008|and don knows this.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and he's he has a he has a script that|D|Bmr016
me001|yeah.|S|Bmr016
me001|i replace the because with because if it's glossed.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but if it's|D|Bmr016
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but then there are other glosses that we don't replace right?|S|Bmr016
me001|and|D|Bmr016
fe016|because|D|Bmr016
fe008|yes and that's why there're different tags on the glosses.|S|Bmr016
fe016|okay so then it's fine.|S|Bmr016
fe008|on the different on the different types of comments.|S|Bmr016
fe008|which we'll which we'll see in just a second.|S|Bmr016
me001|right.|S|Bmr016
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so the pronounceable acronyms get underscores.|S|Bmr016
fe008|the things in curly brackets are viewed as comments.|S|Bmr016
fe008|there're comments of four types.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so this is a good time to introduce that.|S|Bmr016
fe008|the four types.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and maybe we'll expand that.|S|Bmr016
me011|um|D|Bmr016
fe008|but the but the comments are um of four types mainly right now.|S|Bmr016
fe008|one of them is um the gloss type we just mentioned.|S|Bmr016
me011|can|D|Bmr016
fe008|another type is um|D|Bmr016
me011|so are we done with acronyms?|Q|Bmr016
me011|because i had a question on what what this meant.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i'm still doing the overview.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i haven't actually gotten here yet.|S|Bmr016
me011|oh i'm sorry.|S|Bmr016
fe008|okay so gloss is things like replacing the full form with the um more abbreviated one to the left.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uh then you have if it's uh there're a couple different types of elements that can happen that aren't really properly words.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and some of them are laughs and breathes.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so we have uh that's prepended with a a tag of v.o.c.|S|Bmr016
mn014|whew.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and the non vocal ones are like door-slams and tappings.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and that's prepended with a non-vocalization.|S|Bmr016
me018|so then it just an ending curly brace there?|Q|Bmr016
me018|or is there something else in there?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|oh yeah so this would|D|Bmr016
fe008|let's just take one example.|S|Bmr016
me011|a comment basically.|S|Bmr016
me018|oh oh oh.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and then the non-vocalization would be something like a door slam.|S|Bmr016
fe008|they always end.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so it's like they're paired curly brackets.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and then the third type right now uh is things that fall in the category of comments about what's happening.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so it could be something like you know referring to so-and-so.|S|Bmr016
fe008|talking about such and such.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uh you know looking at so-and-so.|S|Bmr016
me018|so on the|D|Bmr016
me018|on the middle so in the first case that gloss applies to the word to the left.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah and this gets substituted here.|S|Bmr016
me018|but in the middle two it's not applying to anything right?|S|Bmr016
me011|they're impulsive.|S|Bmr016
fe008|huh uh.|S|Bmr016
me018|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe008|no they're events.|S|Bmr016
fe008|they're actually they have the status of events.|S|Bmr016
me018|okay.|S|Bmr016
me011|well the qual can be the qual is applying to the left.|S|Bmr016
me018|right i just meant the middle two ones.|S|Bmr016
me011|yep.|S|Bmr016
me018|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe008|well and actually um it is true that with respect to laugh there's another one.|S|Bmr016
fe008|which is while laughing.|S|Bmr016
me011|while laughing.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and that is uh an argument could be made for this turning that into a qualitative statement.|S|Bmr016
fe008|because it's talking about the thing that preceded it.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but at present we haven't been um uh coding the exact scope of laughing you know.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and so to have while laughing you know that it happened somewhere in there.|S|Bmr016
fe008|which could well mean that it occurred separately and following.|S|Bmr016
fe008|or you know including some of the utterances to the left.|S|Bmr016
fe008|haven't been awfully precise about that.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but i have here|D|Bmr016
fe008|now we're about to get to the to this now.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i have frequencies.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so you'll see how often these different things occur.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but um uh the very front page deals with this uh final uh uh aspect of the standardization.|S|Bmr016
fe008|which has to do with the spoken forms like uhhuh and uhhuh and ha and uhuh and all these different types.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and um uh someone pointed out to me.|S|Bmr016
fe008|this might have been chuck about um about how a recognizer if it's looking for uhhuh with three m. 's and it's transcribed with two m. 's that it might uh that it might increase the error rate.|S|Bmr016
fe008|which is which would really be a shame.|S|Bmr016
fe008|because um i i personally would not be able to make a claim that those are dramatically different items.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so right now i've standardized across all the existing data with these spoken forms.|S|Bmr016
me011|oh good.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i i should say|D|Bmr016
me011|so it's a small list.|S|Bmr016
fe008|all existing data except thirty minutes which got found today.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so i'm going to i'm going to i'm going to check|D|Bmr016
me011|that that's known as found data.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe008|actually yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i got it was stored in a place i didn't expect.|S|Bmr016
me001|it's like the zapruder film.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so and and um|F|Bmr016
fe008|we uh reconstructed how that happened.|S|Bmr016
me013|i want to work with lost data.|S|Bmr016
me011|yeah it's much easier.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and this is this'll be great.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so i'll i'll be able to get through that tonight.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and then well actually later today probably.|S|Bmr016
me011|huh.|B|Bmr016
fe008|and so then we'll have everything following these conventions.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but you notice it's really rather a small set of these kinds of things.|S|Bmr016
me011|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and i made it so that these are um with a couple exceptions but things that you wouldn't find in the spell checker.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so that they'll show up really easily.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and um|F|Bmr016
me001|jane can i ask you a question?|Q|Bmr016
me001|what's that very last one correspond to?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|sure.|S|Bmr016
me001|i don't even know how to pronounce that.|S|Bmr016
fe008|well yeah now that that only occurs once.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|and i'm thinking of changing that.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right.|D|Bmr016
fe008|i haven't listened to it.|S|Bmr016
me001|uh is that like someone's like burning or some such thing?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|so i don't know.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i haven't heard it actually.|S|Bmr016
me001|like their hair's on fire.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i i need to listen to that one.|S|Bmr016
me011|uh!|S|Bmr016
fe016|actually we we gave this to our pronunciation person.|S|Bmr016
mn014|it's the castle of uh.|S|Bmr016
me001|uh it looks like that.|S|Bmr016
fe016|she's like i don't know what that is either.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so|F|Bmr016
fe008|did she hear the did she actually hear it?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|no we just gave her a list of words that you know weren't in our dictionary.|S|Bmr016
fe008|because i haven't heard it.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and so of course it picked up stuff like this.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and she just didn't listen.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so she didn't know.|S|Bmr016
fe016|we just we're waiting on that just to do the alignments.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah i'm curious to hear what it is.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but i didn't know want to change it to something else until i knew.|S|Bmr016
fe016|maybe it's argh.|S|Bmr016
me001|right.|B|Bmr016
fe008|well sss you know|D|Bmr016
me001|but that's not really like|D|Bmr016
fe008|hhh.|D|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me001|no one really says argh you know.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right no one|D|Bmr016
me013|well you just did.|S|Bmr016
me001|it's not|D|Bmr016
me001|well|D|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me001|there's another there's another word error.|S|Bmr016
me018|except for now.|S|Bmr016
fe008|that's right.|S|Bmr016
me011|yes that's right.|S|Bmr016
me011|we're going to have a big problem when we talk about that.|S|Bmr016
me001|cha-ching!|S|Bmr016
fe016|uh.|S|Bmr016
me018|we're going to never recognize this meeting.|S|Bmr016
fe008|okay.|D|Bmr016
me011|in monty python you say argh a lot.|S|Bmr016
me001|oh yeah?|Q|Bmr016
me011|so|F|Bmr016
me011|well or if you're a c. programmer.|S|Bmr016
me001|huh.|B|Bmr016
fe008|yeah that's right.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr016
me011|you say arg c. and arg v. all the time.|S|Bmr016
fe008|that's right.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr016
me001|that's true.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but it has a different prosody.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me013|arg.|S|Bmr016
me011|it does.|S|Bmr016
me013|arg arg-max arg-min.|S|Bmr016
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|D|Bmr016
me011|uh!|S|Bmr016
fe008|uh|D|Bmr016
fe016|so jane what's the|D|Bmr016
me011|maybe he died while dictating.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so|F|Bmr016
fe016|i have one question about the the e.h. versus like the a.h. and the u.h.|S|Bmr016
fe008|that's partly a nonnative-native thing.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but i have found e.h. in native speakers too.|S|Bmr016
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but it's mostly non native.|S|Bmr016
fe016|okay.|S|Bmr016
mn014|h.|D|Bmr016
me018|that's uh versus uh?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|uh.|S|Bmr016
me011|uh.|S|Bmr016
fe016|uh yeah right.|S|Bmr016
fe016|because there were were some speakers that did definite uh's.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|but right now we|D|Bmr016
me018|they were the canadians right?|S|Bmr016
me013|canadians yeah yeah yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe008|that's right.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so it it's actually probably good for us to know the difference between the real uh and the one that's just like uh or transcribed ah.|S|Bmr016
fe008|exactly.|S|Bmr016
fe016|because in like in switchboard you would see all of these forms.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but they all were like uh.|S|Bmr016
me011|you mean just the single letter a as in the particle?|Q|Bmr016
mn014|the transcription or|D|Bmr016
fe016|no no i mean like the the u.h.|S|Bmr016
me011|article.|S|Bmr016
fe008|u.h.|S|Bmr016
me011|oh.|S|Bmr016
fe016|or the u.h.e.h.a.h. were all the same.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and then we have this additional non native version of uh like eeh.|S|Bmr016
me001|all the e.h.s. i've seen have been like that.|S|Bmr016
me001|they've been like uh|S|Bmr016
me001|like that have has been transcribed to e.h.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh that's right.|S|Bmr016
me001|and sometimes it's stronger.|S|Bmr016
me001|like eeh which is like closer to e.h.|S|Bmr016
fe008|huh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|right.|B|Bmr016
me001|but|F|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me011|i'm just these poor transcribers they're going to hate this meeting.|S|Bmr016
me001|i know.|S|Bmr016
me001|we should go off line.|S|Bmr016
fe008|well we're not doing we're not doing length.|S|Bmr016
me013|quick thilo do a do a filled pause for us.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah that's right.|S|Bmr016
mn014|ooo no.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but you're a native german speaker.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so it's not a not a issue for|D|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe016|it's only|D|Bmr016
me011|them canadians.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|F|Bmr016
fe016|no only if you don't have lax vowels i guess.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|so it's like japanese and spanish.|S|Bmr016
me011|oh.|B|Bmr016
fe008|this makes sense.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah i i think you've|D|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and|F|Bmr016
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me011|oh i see.|S|Bmr016
fe008|that makes sense.|S|Bmr016
me011|i didn't get that.|S|Bmr016
me011|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah and so you know i mean i have there are some um americans who who are using this uh too.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and i haven't listened to it systematically.|S|Bmr016
fe008|maybe with some of them uh they'd end up being uh's.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but uh my spot checking has made me think that we do have uh in also um american data represented here.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but|F|Bmr016
fe008|any case that's the this is reduced down from really quite a a much longer list.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah this is great.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and this is|D|Bmr016
me001|uhhuh.|S|Bmr016
me011|yeah it's good.|S|Bmr016
fe016|this is really really helpful.|S|Bmr016
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|functionally pretty you know also|D|Bmr016
fe008|it was fascinating i was listening to some of these uh i guess two nights ago.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and it's just hilarious to to to do a search for the uhhuh's.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and you get uhhuh.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and everybody's doing it.|S|Bmr016
me011|and just listen to them.|S|Bmr016
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|just i wanted to say i think it would be fun to make a montage of it.|S|Bmr016
fe008|because there's a uhhuh.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Bmr016
me011|performance art.|S|Bmr016
me011|just extract them all.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right.|S|Bmr016
fe008|it's really it's really fun to listen to.|S|Bmr016
me018|morgan can make a song out of it.|S|Bmr016
fe008|all these different vocal tracts you know.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but it's it's the same item.|S|Bmr016
fe008|it's very interesting.|S|Bmr016
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uh then the acronyms.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and the ones in parentheses are ones which the transcriber wasn't sure of.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and i haven't been able to listen to to to clarify.|S|Bmr016
me011|oh i see.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but you can see that the parenthesis convention makes it very easy to find them.|S|Bmr016
fe008|because it's the only place where where they're used.|S|Bmr016
me011|how about question mark?|Q|Bmr016
mn014|the question marks yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe008|question mark is punctuation.|S|Bmr016
mn014|what are those?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|so it they said that.|S|Bmr016
me011|oh.|S|Bmr016
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe008|um d.c.|S|Bmr016
me011|so they so it's p.l.p.|S|Bmr016
mn014|uh.|S|Bmr016
fe008|exactly.|S|Bmr016
fe008|exactly.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah so the only|D|Bmr016
fe008|well and i do have a stress marker here.|S|Bmr016
fe008|sometimes the contrastive stress is showing up.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and um|D|Bmr016
me013|i'm sorry i i got lost here.|S|Bmr016
me013|what's the difference between the parenthesized acronym and the non-parenthesized?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|the parenthesized is something that the transcriber thought was a.n.n. but wasn't entirely sure.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so i'd need to go back or someone needs to go back and say you know yes or no.|S|Bmr016
me013|uh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|right.|B|Bmr016
fe008|and then get rid of the parentheses.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but the parentheses are used only in that context in the transcripts of of noticing that there's something uncertain.|S|Bmr016
me011|yeah p. make is|D|Bmr016
fe016|yeah i mean because they they have no idea.|S|Bmr016
me011|that's a good one.|S|Bmr016
me011|that's correct.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right.|S|Bmr016
fe016|if you hear c.t.p.d.i. mean they do pretty well.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|but it's|D|Bmr016
me013|i i don't recognize a lot of these.|S|Bmr016
fe016|you know how are how are they going to know?|Q|Bmr016
me011|i know.|S|Bmr016
me013|i|D|Bmr016
me011|i i was saying that i think a lot of them are the networks meeting.|S|Bmr016
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|i think that's true.|S|Bmr016
me013|maybe.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah absolutely.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe008|n.s.a.|S|Bmr016
me011|i see a few.|S|Bmr016
fe008|a lot of these are are coming from them.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i listened to some of that.|S|Bmr016
me011|although i see i see plenty of uh|D|Bmr016
me001|yeah we don't have that many acronyms comparatively in this meeting.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|yeah i agree.|S|Bmr016
me001|it's not so bad.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right.|B|Bmr016
fe008|and robustness has a fair amount.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but the n.s.a. group is just very very many.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me001|huh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|the recognizer it is funny.|S|Bmr016
fe016|kept getting p.t.a. for p.d.a.|S|Bmr016
fe016|this is close.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me011|yeah that's pretty close.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and the p.t.a. was in these uh topics about children.|S|Bmr016
me001|that's not bad.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|so anyway|F|Bmr016
fe008|that's interesting.|S|Bmr016
fe016|is the p. p.t.a. working.|S|Bmr016
fe008|right and sometimes i mean you see a couple of these that are actually okay's.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so it's it's may be that they got to the point where i mean it was low enough understandable|D|Bmr016
fe008|understandability that they weren't entirely sure the person said okay.|S|Bmr016
fe008|you know so it isn't really necessarily a an undecipherable acronym.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but just needs to be double checked.|S|Bmr016
me001|there's a lot of okay's.|S|Bmr016
fe008|now we get to the comments.|S|Bmr016
me013|the number to the left is the number of incidences?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|this|D|Bmr016
me011|count.|S|Bmr016
fe008|number of times out of the entire database.|S|Bmr016
me011|yep.|S|Bmr016
me013|uhhuh.|D|Bmr016
fe008|except for that last thirty minutes i haven't checked yet.|S|Bmr016
me013|so c.t.s. is really big here.|S|Bmr016
me011|yeah i wonder what it is.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr016
mn014|so what is the difference between papers rustling and rustling papers?|Q|Bmr016
me013|i.p.|S|Bmr016
me013|i know what i.p. is.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i'd have to listen.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i i agree.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i i'd like to standardize these down farther.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but um uh|F|Bmr016
fe008|uh to me that sounds equivalent.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but i i'm a little hesitant to to collapse across categories unless i actually listen to them.|S|Bmr016
mn014|seems so.|S|Bmr016
me013|okay.|S|Bmr016
me011|oh i'm sure we've said x.m.l. more than five times.|S|Bmr016
fe008|well then at least now.|S|Bmr016
me013|six now yeah.|S|Bmr016
mn014|now it's at least six times yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|six.|S|Bmr016
fe008|okay well|F|Bmr016
me013|the self-referential aspect of these these|D|Bmr016
fe016|i'm|D|Bmr016
me011|yes it's very bad.|S|Bmr016
me001|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe016|well this is exactly how people will prove that these meetings do differ because we're recording right?|S|Bmr016
me011|yes.|S|Bmr016
fe016|normally you don't go around saying now you've said it six times.|S|Bmr016
me011|yeah that's right.|S|Bmr016
fe016|now you've|D|Bmr016
fe008|but did you notice that there were seven hundred and eighty five instances of okay?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|and that's just without the without punctuation.|S|Bmr016
me011|yep.|S|Bmr016
me013|no i didn't.|S|Bmr016
mn014|seven hundred eighty five instances.|S|Bmr016
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me011|and that's an underestimate.|S|Bmr016
fe008|extra forty one if it's questioned.|S|Bmr016
me011|because they're|D|Bmr016
me018|where's that?|Q|Bmr016
me013|so|D|Bmr016
me011|yep.|S|Bmr016
fe008|on the page two of acronyms.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me001|is this after like did you do some uh replacements for all the different form of okay to this?|Q|Bmr016
me013|seven hundred eighty.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe008|of okay yes.|S|Bmr016
me001|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe008|so that's the single existing convention for okay.|S|Bmr016
me018|wait a minute.|S|Bmr016
me013|so now we're up to seven hundred and eighty eight.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah that's|D|Bmr016
me001|although what's there's one with a slash after it.|S|Bmr016
me001|that's kind of disturbing.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe008|that's that's i looked for that one.|S|Bmr016
me011|yeah we'll have to look at it you know.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me001|anyway|F|Bmr016
fe008|i actually explicitly looked for that one.|S|Bmr016
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe008|and i think that um|D|Bmr016
fe008|i i'm not exactly sure about that.|S|Bmr016
me018|was that somewhere where they were going to say new speaker or something?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|no i looked for that.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but that doesn't actually exist.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and it may be|D|Bmr016
fe008|i don't i can't explain that.|S|Bmr016
me001|that's all right.|S|Bmr016
me001|i'm just pointing that out.|S|Bmr016
fe008|it's the only|D|Bmr016
me001|there's|D|Bmr016
fe008|it's the only pattern that has a slash after it.|S|Bmr016
fe016|well there's not.|D|Bmr016
fe008|and i think it's it's an epiphenomenon.|S|Bmr016
me011|so i'll just i was just looking at the bottom of page three there.|S|Bmr016
me011|is that to be or not to be?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|oh that's cute.|S|Bmr016
me018|there's no tilde in front of it.|S|Bmr016
me018|so|F|Bmr016
fe008|that's funny.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr016
me011|okay anyways sorry.|S|Bmr016
fe008|there is one|D|Bmr016
me011|try to stay on topic adam.|S|Bmr016
fe008|well no that's that's legitimate.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so now uh comments you can see they're listed again.|S|Bmr016
fe008|same deal with exhaustive listing of everything found in everything except for these final thirty minutes.|S|Bmr016
me011|okay so um on some of these quals|D|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me011|are they really quals?|Q|Bmr016
me011|or are they glosses?|Q|Bmr016
me011|so like there's a qual t.c.l.|S|Bmr016
fe008|t.c.l.|S|Bmr016
fe008|where do you see that?|Q|Bmr016
me011|uh|F|Bmr016
fe008|oh oh.|S|Bmr016
fe008|the reason is because it was said tickle.|S|Bmr016
me013|what's a qual?|Q|Bmr016
me011|oh i see i see.|S|Bmr016
me001|huh.|B|Bmr016
me011|so it's not gloss.|S|Bmr016
me011|okay i see.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yep.|S|Bmr016
me011|it wasn't said t.c.l.|S|Bmr016
me001|shouldn't it be qual t.i.c.k.l.e. or something?|Q|Bmr016
me011|of course.|S|Bmr016
me001|like it's not|D|Bmr016
fe008|on the in the actual script in the actual transcript i i|D|Bmr016
fe008|so this this happens in the very first one.|S|Bmr016
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe008|i actually wrote it as tickle.|S|Bmr016
me001|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe008|because we they didn't say t.c.l. they said tickle.|S|Bmr016
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|right.|B|Bmr016
fe008|and then following that is qual t.c.l.|S|Bmr016
me001|oh i see.|S|Bmr016
me013|i i forget.|S|Bmr016
me001|okay.|S|Bmr016
me013|what's qual?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|qualifier.|S|Bmr016
me018|it's just comment about what they said.|S|Bmr016
fe008|comment.|S|Bmr016
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|comment or contextual comment.|S|Bmr016
me001|it's not something you want to replace with.|S|Bmr016
me018|so they didn't mean tickle as in elmo.|S|Bmr016
me001|but|F|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
mn014|tickle.|S|Bmr016
me018|they meant tickle as in|D|Bmr016
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|huh.|B|Bmr016
me013|right.|B|Bmr016
fe016|but at some point i mean we probably|D|Bmr016
me011|we'll probably add it to the language model.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but we should add it to the|D|Bmr016
fe016|no to the pronunciation model.|S|Bmr016
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me011|what did i say?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|language uh|D|Bmr016
mn014|to the language model model.|S|Bmr016
me011|well both.|S|Bmr016
me011|we can go on add it to both dictionary and language model.|S|Bmr016
fe016|oh oh|D|Bmr016
me018|add what liz?|Q|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|it's in the language model.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah but so it's the pronunciation model that has to have a pronunciation of tickle.|S|Bmr016
me011|well tickle was pronounced tickle.|S|Bmr016
me011|right?|Q|Bmr016
me018|what are you saying?|Q|Bmr016
me011|it's pronounced the same it's pronounced the same as the verb.|S|Bmr016
mn014|tickle is pronounced tickle?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|i'm sorry.|S|Bmr016
me011|so i think it's the language model that makes it different.|S|Bmr016
fe016|oh sorry.|S|Bmr016
fe016|what i meant is that there should be a pronunciation tickle for t.c.l. as a word.|S|Bmr016
me011|oh i see.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and that word in the in you know it stays in the language model wherever it was.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me013|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me011|right.|B|Bmr016
me011|right.|B|Bmr016
fe016|yeah you never would put tickle in the language model in that form.|S|Bmr016
me013|right.|B|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr016
me011|right.|B|Bmr016
fe016|right.|B|Bmr016
fe016|there's actually a bunch of cases like this with people's names and|D|Bmr016
me018|so how there'd be a problem for doing the language modeling then with our transcripts the way they are.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yes.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|yeah so there's a few cases like that where the um the word needs to be spelled out in in a consistent way as it would appear in the language.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but there's not very many of these.|S|Bmr016
fe016|tcl's one of them.|S|Bmr016
me011|and and you'll you'll have to do it sychronously.|S|Bmr016
fe016|um|D|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me011|right so so whoever's creating the new models will have to also go through the transcripts and change them synchronously.|S|Bmr016
me001|it's just disturbing.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right.|B|Bmr016
fe016|right.|B|Bmr016
fe016|we have this there is this thing i was going to talk to you about at some point about you know what do we do with the dictionary as we're updating the dictionary?|Q|Bmr016
me018|huh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|these changes have to be consistent with what's in the like spelling people's names and so forth.|S|Bmr016
fe016|if we make a spelling correction to their name|D|Bmr016
fe016|like someone had deborah tannen's name misspelled.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and since we know who that is you know we could correct it.|S|Bmr016
me011|you can correct it.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but|F|Bmr016
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|but we need to make sure we have the|D|Bmr016
fe016|if it doesn't get corrected we have to have a pronunciation as a misspelled word in the dictionary.|S|Bmr016
fe016|things like that.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me011|these are so funny to read.|S|Bmr016
fe008|well of course now the the tannen the spelling change|D|Bmr016
fe016|so|F|Bmr016
fe008|uh that's what gets i i picked those up in the frequency check.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right right.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so if there's things that get corrected before we get them it's it's not an issue.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but if there's things that um we change later then we always have to keep our the dictionary up to date.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|and then yeah in the case of tickle i guess we would just have a you know word t.c.l. which|S|Bmr016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me011|you add it to the dictionary.|S|Bmr016
fe016|which normally would be an acronym.|S|Bmr016
fe016|you know t.c.l.|S|Bmr016
me011|right.|B|Bmr016
fe016|but just has another pronunciation.|S|Bmr016
me011|yep.|B|Bmr016
fe008|icsi is is one of those that sometimes people pronounce and sometimes they say i.c.s.i.|S|Bmr016
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe008|so those that are are listed in the acronyms i actually know.|S|Bmr016
fe016|oh yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|they were said as letters.|S|Bmr016
fe008|the others um those really do need to be listened to.|S|Bmr016
fe008|because i haven't been able to go to all the icsi things.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right exactly.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and and until they've been listened to they stay as i.c.s.i.|S|Bmr016
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|right.|S|Bmr016
me013|don and i were just noticing.|S|Bmr016
me013|love this one over on page three.|S|Bmr016
me013|vocal vocal gesture mimicking sound of screwing something into head to hold mike in place.|S|Bmr016
me001|that's great.|S|Bmr016
me011|it's this rrre-rrre-rrre.|S|Bmr016
me011|it was me.|S|Bmr016
fe008|it was.|S|Bmr016
fe008|in fact it was.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr016
me011|a lot of these are me.|S|Bmr016
fe008|he he he said he said get|D|Bmr016
me011|the the beep is said with a high high pitch and lengthening.|S|Bmr016
mn014|to head.|D|Bmr016
fe008|yeah that's it.|S|Bmr016
me011|that was the i was imitating uh beeping out.|S|Bmr016
me013|beep.|S|Bmr016
fe008|perfect.|S|Bmr016
fe016|oh there is something spelled out b.e.e.e.e.e.e.p.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|yeah that's it.|S|Bmr016
me001|um|D|Bmr016
fe008|that's it.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah that's that's been changed.|S|Bmr016
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|in the old|D|Bmr016
fe016|thank you.|S|Bmr016
fe016|because he was saying how many e. 's do i have to allow for.|S|Bmr016
me001|you need a lot of|D|Bmr016
me011|what i meant was beep.|S|Bmr016
me001|you need a lot of qualification adam.|S|Bmr016
fe008|that's been changed.|S|Bmr016
me011|i guess so.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so exactly that's where the lengthening comment came in.|S|Bmr016
me011|anyway|F|Bmr016
fe016|right thanks.|S|Bmr016
me001|subtext.|S|Bmr016
fe008|brought it down.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|S|Bmr016
me011|so they're vocalization|D|Bmr016
fe016|right.|B|Bmr016
fe008|and those of course get get picked up in the frequency check.|S|Bmr016
me011|glosses.|S|Bmr016
fe008|because you see beep.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right.|B|Bmr016
fe008|and you know i mean it gets kicked out in the spelling.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right.|B|Bmr016
fe008|and it also gets kicked out in the uh frequency listing.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right.|B|Bmr016
fe008|i have the there're various things like breathe versus breath versus inhale and hhh.|S|Bmr016
fe008|you know i don't know.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i i think they don't have any implications for anything else.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so it's like i'm tempted to leave them for now.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and it's easy enough to find them when they're in curly brackets.|S|Bmr016
fe008|we can always get an exhaustive listing of these things and find them and change them.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me013|sings finale type song.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me001|yeah that was in the first meeting.|S|Bmr016
me013|that's that's good.|S|Bmr016
me011|um|D|Bmr016
fe008|yeah but i don't actually remember what it was.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but that was eric did that.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me011|so on|D|Bmr016
me013|tah-dah.|S|Bmr016
me013|i don't know.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i think maybe something like that.|S|Bmr016
me013|something like that?|Q|Bmr016
me013|maybe yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe008|well that'd qualify.|S|Bmr016
me011|on the glosses for numbers|D|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me011|it seems like there are lots of different ways it's being done.|S|Bmr016
fe008|okay.|B|Bmr016
fe008|interesting question.|S|Bmr016
me011|there's a|D|Bmr016
fe008|yes.|S|Bmr016
fe008|okay now first of all|D|Bmr016
fe008|ooo-ooo!|S|Bmr016
fe008|very important.|S|Bmr016
me011|ooo-ooo.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uh chuck chuck led to a refinement here.|S|Bmr016
fe008|which is to add nums if these are parts of the read numbers.|S|Bmr016
fe008|now you already know that i had uh in places where they hadn't transcribed numbers i put numbers in place of any kind of numbers.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but there are places where they|D|Bmr016
fe008|um it this convention came later.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and at the very first digits task in some transcripts they actually transcribed numbers.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and um|F|Bmr016
fe008|chuck pointed out that this is read speech.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and it's nice to have the option of ignoring it for certain other uh uh things.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and that's why there's this other tag here which occurs a hundred and five or three hundred and five times right now.|S|Bmr016
fe008|which is just well nums by itself.|S|Bmr016
me011|nums.|S|Bmr016
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|which means this is part of the numbers task.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i may change it to digits.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i mean with the sed command you can really just change it however you want.|S|Bmr016
fe008|because it's systematically encoded you know?|S|Bmr016
me011|yep.|S|Bmr016
fe008|have to think about what's the best for for the overall purposes.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but in any case um numbers and nums are a part of this digits task thing.|S|Bmr016
fe008|um now then i have these numbers that have quotation marks around them.|S|Bmr016
fe008|um i didn't want to put them in as gloss comments.|S|Bmr016
fe008|because then you get the substitution.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and actually um the reason i did it this way was because i initially started out with the other version.|S|Bmr016
fe008|you have the numbers and you have the full form and the parentheses.|S|Bmr016
fe008|however sometimes people stumble over these numbers they're saying.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so you say seventy eight point two or whatever.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and there's no way of capturing that if you're putting the numbers off to the side.|S|Bmr016
fe008|you can't have the seven and|D|Bmr016
me011|so what's to the left of these?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|the left is|D|Bmr016
fe008|so example the very first one|D|Bmr016
fe008|it would be spelled out in words point five.|S|Bmr016
me011|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me011|okay that's what i was asking.|S|Bmr016
me011|right.|S|Bmr016
fe008|only it's spelled out in words.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so this is also spelled out in in words.|S|Bmr016
me011|point f.i.v.e. yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe008|point five.|S|Bmr016
me011|good.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and then in here nums.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so it's not going to be mistaken as a gloss.|S|Bmr016
fe008|it comes out as nums quote dot five.|S|Bmr016
me011|okay now the other example is in the glosses right there|D|Bmr016
fe008|thank you.|D|Bmr016
me011|gloss one one one dash one three zero.|S|Bmr016
me001|right.|B|Bmr016
fe008|well now|D|Bmr016
me011|what what's to the left of that?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|in that case it's people saying things like one one one dash so-and-so.|S|Bmr016
fe008|or they're saying uh two i mean zero whatever.|S|Bmr016
me011|okay.|B|Bmr016
fe008|and in that case it's part of the numbers task.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and it's not going to be included in the read digits anyway.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so i in the uh|D|Bmr016
me018|so there will be a nums tag on those lines?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|there is.|S|Bmr016
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|i've added that all now too.|S|Bmr016
me011|good.|S|Bmr016
me001|there's a numbers tag|D|Bmr016
fe016|wait.|S|Bmr016
me001|i'm sorry i'm i didn't follow that last thing.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so so gloss in the same line that would have gloss quote one one one dash one thirty you'd have a gloss at the end of the line saying uh curly bracket nums curly bracket.|S|Bmr016
me001|right.|B|Bmr016
fe008|so if you if you did a uh a grep minus v. nums.|S|Bmr016
fe016|oh so you could do grep minus v. nums.|S|Bmr016
fe016|so that's the|D|Bmr016
fe008|and you get rid of anything that was read.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|so there wouldn't be something like|D|Bmr016
me001|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe016|if somebody said something like boy i'm really tired okay and then started reading that would be on a separate line.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yes.|S|Bmr016
fe016|okay great.|S|Bmr016
fe016|because i was doing the grep minus v. quick and dirty.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and looked like that was working okay.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|but|F|Bmr016
fe008|good.|S|Bmr016
fe016|great.|B|Bmr016
fe008|yep.|B|Bmr016
fe016|now why do we what's the reason for having like the point five have the nums on it?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|is that just like when they're talking about their data or something?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|this is more because|D|Bmr016
fe016|or|D|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe008|oh these are all these the nums point this all where they're saying point something or other.|S|Bmr016
fe016|these are all like inside the spontaneous|D|Bmr016
fe008|and the other thing too is for readability of the transcript.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i mean if you're trying to follow this while you're reading it it's really hard to read you know|D|Bmr016
fe008|uh so in the data column five has you know one point five compared to seventy nine point six.|S|Bmr016
fe008|it's like when you see the words it's really hard to follow the argument.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and this is just really a a way of someone who would handle the data in a more discourse y way to be able to follow what's being said.|S|Bmr016
fe016|oh okay.|S|Bmr016
me011|label it.|S|Bmr016
fe016|i see.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so this is where chuck's um overall architecture comes in.|S|Bmr016
fe008|where we're going to have a master file of the channelized data.|S|Bmr016
fe008|um there will be scripts that are written to convert it into these these main two uses.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and some scripts will take it down into a a take it to a format that's usable for the recognizer.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uh other scripts will take it to a form that's usable for the for linguistics and discourse analysis.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and um the implication that that i have is that the master copy will stay unchanged.|S|Bmr016
fe008|these will just be things that are generated.|S|Bmr016
me011|right.|B|Bmr016
fe008|and|F|Bmr016
fe016|okay.|B|Bmr016
fe008|by using scripts.|S|Bmr016
me011|master copies of superset.|S|Bmr016
fe008|when things change then the the script will change.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but the but there won't be stored copies of in different versions of things.|S|Bmr016
me011|good.|B|Bmr016
fe016|so i guess i'd have one request here.|S|Bmr016
fe016|which is just um maybe to make it more robust.|S|Bmr016
fe016|that the tag whatever you would choose for this type of nums where it's inside the spontaneous speech is different than the tag that you use for the read speech.|S|Bmr016
me018|right.|B|Bmr016
me018|right that would argue for changing the other ones to be digits or something.|S|Bmr016
fe016|um that way if we make a mistake parsing or something we don't see the point five.|S|Bmr016
fe016|or or it's not there then we|D|Bmr016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|just and actually for things like seven eighths or|D|Bmr016
fe016|people do fractions too i guess.|S|Bmr016
fe016|you maybe you want one overall tag for sort of that would be similar to that.|S|Bmr016
fe008|except|D|Bmr016
fe016|or|F|Bmr016
fe016|as long as they're as they're different strings that we that'll make our sort of processing more robust.|S|Bmr016
fe008|well|D|Bmr016
fe016|because we really will get rid of everything that has the nums string in it.|S|Bmr016
me018|i suppose what you could do is just make sure that you get rid of everything that has curly brace nums curly brace.|S|Bmr016
fe008|well|D|Bmr016
fe008|exactly.|S|Bmr016
fe008|exactly.|S|Bmr016
me018|i mean that would be the|D|Bmr016
fe008|that was that was my motivation.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|and these can be changed like i said.|S|Bmr016
fe008|you know i mean as i said i was considering changing it to digits.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and it just you know it's just a matter of deciding on whatever it is and being sure the scripts know.|S|Bmr016
me018|right.|S|Bmr016
fe016|it would probably be safer if you're willing to have a separate tag.|S|Bmr016
fe016|just because um then we know for sure.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and we can also do counts on them without having to do the processing.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but you're right.|S|Bmr016
fe016|we could do it this way.|S|Bmr016
fe016|it it should work.|S|Bmr016
fe016|um|F|Bmr016
me018|yeah and it makes it i guess the thing about|D|Bmr016
fe016|but it's probably not hard for a person to tell the difference.|S|Bmr016
fe016|because one's in the context of a you know a transcribed word string.|S|Bmr016
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me018|right.|B|Bmr016
fe008|the other thing is you can get really so minute with these things.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and|F|Bmr016
fe016|so|F|Bmr016
fe008|and increase the size of the files and the and decrease the readability to such an extent by simply something like percent.|S|Bmr016
fe008|now i i could have adopted a similar convention for percent.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but somehow percent is not so hard you know?|S|Bmr016
me011|huh.|B|Bmr016
fe008|it's just when you have these points and you're trying to figure out where the decimal places are.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and we could always add it later.|S|Bmr016
fe008|percent's easy to detect.|S|Bmr016
fe008|point however is is uh a word that has a couple different meanings.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and you'll find both of those in one of these meetings.|S|Bmr016
fe008|where he's saying well the first point i want to make is so-and-so.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and he goes through four points.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and also has all these decimals.|S|Bmr016
me018|so liz what does the recognizer do|D|Bmr016
fe008|so|F|Bmr016
me018|uh|F|Bmr016
me013|huh.|B|Bmr016
me018|what does the s.r.i. recognizer output for things like that?|Q|Bmr016
me018|seven point five.|S|Bmr016
me018|does it output the word|D|Bmr016
fe016|seven point five.|S|Bmr016
me018|right.|S|Bmr016
me011|well the numbers.|S|Bmr016
me018|the word seven.|S|Bmr016
me018|the number seven.|S|Bmr016
fe016|the word.|S|Bmr016
me018|the word seven okay.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me013|so i'd so i'd like i'd like to talk about point five.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and and actually you know the language|D|Bmr016
fe016|it's the same point actually.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe016|the the you know the word to and the word going to and to go to|D|Bmr016
fe016|those are two different to's.|S|Bmr016
fe016|and so there's no distinction there.|S|Bmr016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|it's just just the word point has|D|Bmr016
fe016|yeah every word has only one yeah one version|D|Bmr016
fe016|even if even if it's|D|Bmr016
fe016|actually even like the word read and read.|S|Bmr016
fe016|those are two different words.|S|Bmr016
fe016|they're spelled the same way right?|S|Bmr016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|and they're still going to be transcribed as r.e.a.d.|S|Bmr016
me013|right.|B|Bmr016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|so|F|Bmr016
fe016|yeah i i like the idea of having this in there.|S|Bmr016
fe016|i just i was a little bit worried that um the tag for removing the read speech.|S|Bmr016
fe016|because what if we have like read letters?|Q|Bmr016
fe016|or i don't know.|S|Bmr016
me011|we might want to just a separate tag that says it's read.|S|Bmr016
fe016|like read something.|S|Bmr016
fe016|like read.|S|Bmr016
fe016|yeah basically.|S|Bmr016
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|but other than that it sounds great.|S|Bmr016
me011|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me011|okay.|S|Bmr016
me011|are we done?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|well i wanted to say also regarding the channelized data.|S|Bmr016
me011|oh i guess we're not done.|S|Bmr016
fe008|that um thilo requested um that we get some segments done by hand to reduce the size of the time bins.|S|Bmr016
me018|yeah.|S|Bmr016
fe008|like was chuck was mentioning earlier.|S|Bmr016
fe008|that um that um if you if you said oh and it was in part of a really long complex overlapping segment that the same start and end times would be held for that one.|S|Bmr016
me011|well|D|Bmr016
fe008|as for the longer utterances.|S|Bmr016
me011|we did that for one meeting right?|S|Bmr016
fe008|and|D|Bmr016
me011|so you have that data don't you?|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah that's the training data.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and he requested that there be uh similar uh samples done for five minute stretches involving a variety of speakers and overlapping sections.|S|Bmr016
fe008|he gave me he did the very nice he he did some shopping through the data.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|and found segments that would be useful.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and at this point all four of the ones that he specified have been done.|S|Bmr016
fe008|in addition the i've i have the transcribers expanding the amount that they're doing actually.|S|Bmr016
mn014|oh great.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so right now um i know that as of today we got an extra fifteen minutes of that type.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and i'm having them expand the realm on either side of these places where they've already started.|S|Bmr016
mn014|oh great.|S|Bmr016
mn014|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but if if you know and i and he's going to give me some more sections that that he thinks would be useful for this purpose.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|because it's true.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i mean if we could do the the more fine grained tuning of this uh using an algorithm that would be so much more efficient.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and um|F|Bmr016
fe008|so this is going to be useful to expand this.|S|Bmr016
mn014|so i i thought we we we perhaps we should try to to start with those channelized versions.|S|Bmr016
mn014|just to just to try it.|S|Bmr016
mn014|give it give one transcriber the the channelized version of of my speech-nonspeech detection.|S|Bmr016
mn014|and look if if that's helpful for them.|S|Bmr016
mn014|or just let them try if if that's better.|S|Bmr016
mn014|or if they if they can|D|Bmr016
fe008|you mean to start from scratch in a brand new transcript.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah yeah.|S|Bmr016
mn014|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|that'd be excellent.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yeah that'd be really great.|S|Bmr016
fe008|as it stands we're still in the phase of sort of um cleaning up the existing data.|S|Bmr016
fe008|getting things uh in more tightly time uh aligned.|S|Bmr016
fe008|i also want to tell um i also wanted to raise the issue that okay so there's this idea we're going to have this master copy of the transcript.|S|Bmr016
fe008|it's going to be modified by scripts into these two different functions.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and actually the master|D|Bmr016
me018|two or more.|S|Bmr016
me018|two or more different functions.|S|Bmr016
fe008|two two or more.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and that the master is going to be the channelized version.|S|Bmr016
me018|right.|B|Bmr016
fe008|so right now we've taken this initial one it was a single channel basically the way it was input.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and now uh thanks to the advances made in the interface we can from now on use the channelized part.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and um any changes that are made get made in the channelized version kind of thing.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but i wanted to get all the finished all the checks.|S|Bmr016
me018|yeah so that has implications for your script.|S|Bmr016
me001|yeah.|S|Bmr016
me001|so uh have those the the ten hours that have been transcribed already have those been channelized?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|yes they have.|S|Bmr016
me001|and i know i've seen i've seen they've been channelized.|S|Bmr016
me011|all ten hours?|Q|Bmr016
fe008|except for the missing thirty minutes.|S|Bmr016
me001|but|D|Bmr016
me011|great.|S|Bmr016
me001|have they uh have they been has the time have the time markings been adjusted uh on a per channel|D|Bmr016
fe008|uh for for a total of like twenty|D|Bmr016
fe008|for a total of|D|Bmr016
fe008|let's see four times|D|Bmr016
fe008|total of about an thirty minutes.|S|Bmr016
fe008|that's that's been the case.|S|Bmr016
me001|so|D|Bmr016
fe008|and plus the training whatever you have.|S|Bmr016
me001|i guess i mean i don't know if we should talk about this now or not.|S|Bmr016
me001|but|D|Bmr016
me011|well it's just we're missing tea.|S|Bmr016
me001|yeah i know.|S|Bmr016
me011|so|F|Bmr016
me001|no but i mean my question is like should i wait until all of those are processed and channelized?|S|Bmr016
me001|like the time markings are adjusted before i do all the processing.|S|Bmr016
me001|and we start like branching off into the into the our layer of uh transcripts.|S|Bmr016
fe008|well you know the problem the problem is that some some of the adjustments that they're making are to bring are to combine bins that were time bins which were previously separate.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and the reason they do that is sometimes there's a word that's cut off.|S|Bmr016
me001|right.|B|Bmr016
fe008|and so it's true that it's likely to be adjusted in the way that the words are more complete.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and|F|Bmr016
me001|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so i it's going to be a more reliable thing.|S|Bmr016
me001|no i know i know that adjusting those things are going to is going to make it better.|S|Bmr016
fe008|and i'm not sure|D|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|S|Bmr016
me001|i mean i'm sure about that.|S|Bmr016
me001|but do you have like a time frame when you can expect like all of it to be done?|Q|Bmr016
me001|or when you expect them to finish it or|D|Bmr016
fe008|well partly it depends on how um how effective it will be to apply an algorithm.|S|Bmr016
fe008|because this takes time.|S|Bmr016
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr016
fe008|you know it takes a couple hours to do uh ten minutes.|S|Bmr016
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me001|yeah i don't doubt it.|S|Bmr016
me001|um so|F|Bmr016
me018|so right now the what you're doing is you're taking the uh the original version.|S|Bmr016
me018|and you're sort of channelizing yourself right?|S|Bmr016
me001|yeah i'm doing it myself.|S|Bmr016
me001|i mean if the time markings aren't different across channels.|S|Bmr016
me001|like the channelized version really doesn't have any more information.|S|Bmr016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me001|so i was just i mean originally i had done before like the channelized versions were coming out.|S|Bmr016
me018|right.|B|Bmr016
me018|right.|B|Bmr016
me001|um|F|Bmr016
me001|and so it's a question of like what|D|Bmr016
me018|so i i i think probably the way it'll go is that you know when we make this first general version and then start working on the script that script that will be you know primarily come from what you've done um we'll need to work on a channelized version of those originals.|S|Bmr016
me001|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh.|D|Bmr016
me001|uhhuh.|D|Bmr016
me018|and so it should be pretty much identical to what you have.|S|Bmr016
fe008|yep.|S|Bmr016
me018|except for the one that they've already tightened the boundaries on.|S|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me001|right.|S|Bmr016
me018|um|F|Bmr016
fe008|yeah i mean|D|Bmr016
me018|so|F|Bmr016
fe008|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me018|uh and then probably what will happen is as the transcribers finish tightening more and more you know that original version will get updated.|S|Bmr016
me018|and then we'll rerun the script and produce better uh versions.|S|Bmr016
me001|okay.|S|Bmr016
me018|but the i guess the the effect for you guys because you're pulling out the little wave forms into separate ones that would mean these boundaries are constantly changing.|S|Bmr016
me018|you'd have to constantly rerun that.|S|Bmr016
me001|i know.|S|Bmr016
me018|so maybe|D|Bmr016
me001|right.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but that that's not hard.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but that|D|Bmr016
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me001|no.|S|Bmr016
fe016|i think the harder part is making sure that the the transcription|D|Bmr016
me018|okay.|B|Bmr016
fe016|so if you merge two things then you know that it's the sum of the transcripts.|S|Bmr016
fe016|but if you split inside something you don't where the word which words moved.|S|Bmr016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|and that's that's where it becomes a little bit uh having to rerun the processing.|S|Bmr016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
fe016|the cutting of the waveforms is pretty trivial.|S|Bmr016
me001|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me001|i mean as long as it can all be done automatically i mean then that's not a concern.|S|Bmr016
me001|you know if i just have to run three scripts to extract it all and let it run on my computer for an hour and a half or however long it takes to parse and create all the reference file that's not a problem.|S|Bmr016
fe016|right.|B|Bmr016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me018|uhhuh.|B|Bmr016
me001|um|F|Bmr016
me001|so yeah.|F|Bmr016
me001|as long as we're at that point.|S|Bmr016
me001|and i know exactly like what the steps will work what's going on in the editing process.|S|Bmr016
me018|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me001|so|F|Bmr016
me001|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe008|so that's i mean i could there were other checks that i did.|S|Bmr016
fe008|but it's i think that we've unless you think there's anything else i think that i've covered it.|S|Bmr016
me013|yeah.|B|Bmr016
me018|i can't think of any of the other ones.|S|Bmr016
fe008|okay.|S|Bmr016
fe008|great.|S|Bmr016
me013|okay.|S|Bmr016
me011|oop!|S|Bmr016
me011|man!|S|Bmr016
