fe008|all right.|S|Btr002
fe008|so uh welcome back.|S|Btr002
fe008|thank you for coming.|S|Btr002
fe008|um so what i thought we'd do today is pick up where we were last time.|S|Btr002
fe008|and maybe uh go over some some ideas about um|D|Btr002
fe008|well the return to the conventions.|S|Btr002
fe008|but i also wanted to uh share with you a couple of the things that i've picked up in terms of checking.|S|Btr002
fe008|and these are uh these are things that came up with the with the tigerfish transcripts.|S|Btr002
fe008|i'm just doing this because i think it's interesting.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay so um i have an example|D|Btr002
fe066|thank you.|S|Btr002
fe067|oh there's hold on.|S|Btr002
fe008|which|D|Btr002
fe008|um so there're a couple of examples.|S|Btr002
fe008|i have one in front of you which is the one where|D|Btr002
fe008|um um|F|Btr002
fe008|leah leah noticed this one where i said something and um the transcriber interpreted it as twosome gruesome uh different sizes different this.|S|Btr002
fe008|and um actually what i meant to say was um so you're saying groups of different sizes.|S|Btr002
fe008|different size groups.|S|Btr002
fe066|whoa.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|wow.|S|Btr002
fe008|i|D|Btr002
fe008|it's really enormously far away.|S|Btr002
fe008|now this this could be one of those cases where the auditory was just really bad.|S|Btr002
fe069|that's what i was just thinking.|S|Btr002
fe069|or maybe it was really quiet or something.|S|Btr002
fe069|i don't know.|S|Btr002
fe008|maybe very very soft.|S|Btr002
fe008|maybe with the microphone noise.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|or something from someone else.|S|Btr002
fe008|or an overlap.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|or|F|Btr002
fe008|but they're not usually that bad i i don't think.|S|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|then um i have a couple of others.|S|Btr002
fe008|so there's one um|D|Btr002
fe008|so the person said interesting idea.|S|Btr002
fe008|but tigerfish thought it was uh just an idea.|S|Btr002
fe008|now that changes the meaning.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|it's interesting.|S|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe068|right.|S|Btr002
fe008|and then there are various ones like um um ish decay instead of h.t.k.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh.|B|Btr002
fe069|ugh.|S|Btr002
fe008|and now this one|D|Btr002
fe068|ish decay?|Q|Btr002
fe008|ish decay.|S|Btr002
fe008|now ish was in parentheses.|S|Btr002
fe066|ish decay.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah what's an ish?|Q|Btr002
fe008|well they they they were suspicious that wasn't right.|S|Btr002
fe008|but that was the closest they could come.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and you know with when you're dealing with acronyms|D|Btr002
fe069|wow.|S|Btr002
fe008|that's that's that shows one of the problems with acronyms.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|is that it's clear if you know it.|S|Btr002
fe069|i wonder if that was someone who was who had an accent maybe.|S|Btr002
fe008|but|F|Btr002
fe008|always conceivable.|S|Btr002
fe008|i don't remember off hand.|S|Btr002
fe008|i did check the example.|S|Btr002
fe008|and um|F|Btr002
fe008|well and this this would be consistent.|S|Btr002
fe008|so uh it was transcribed as with h. .|S|Btr002
fe008|but it was really with age.|S|Btr002
fe069|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|and uh then there are some where actually punctuation changes the meaning.|S|Btr002
fe008|so this is these are things that barbara uh found.|S|Btr002
fe008|spurts wouldn't be right was what it looked like.|S|Btr002
fe008|but actually when you listen to it it would be spurts wouldn't be right.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|huh.|S|Btr002
fe069|oh.|S|Btr002
fe069|that's very subtle.|S|Btr002
fe008|it is subtle.|S|Btr002
fe008|and yet you know it's like and instead of instead of and it's they put annette's.|S|Btr002
me070|annette's?|Q|Btr002
fe008|now this this is interesting.|S|Btr002
fe008|because it's like you know we know that there's no annette on any of the meetings we've ever dealt with.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|S|Btr002
fe069|right.|S|Btr002
fe008|but um it's you know conceivable.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|S|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and then|D|Btr002
fe008|um|F|Btr002
fe008|let's see.|S|Btr002
fe008|there's one other here i thought was interesting.|S|Btr002
fe008|well this was|D|Btr002
fe008|okay so it should have been the quals the the quals slides will be fine.|S|Btr002
fe008|this is jerry feldman.|S|Btr002
fe008|and uh instead it was transcribed with the and then an uncertain syllable the the and then all the slides will be fine.|S|Btr002
fe066|uh.|S|Btr002
fe008|which is interesting.|S|Btr002
fe068|oh.|S|Btr002
fe008|and and you know this was a case where the timebin was off.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|i wanted to bring an example where|D|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|oh.|B|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|so all the slides it's started too late.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|it's another case of devoicing at the initial|D|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|so i thought that was very interesting.|S|Btr002
fe008|and i think that it shows um these sorts of things i was thinking it would be interesting to do an analysis of these things.|S|Btr002
fe008|because i think that|D|Btr002
fe008|um|F|Btr002
fe008|if well first of all there's this overall point that it shows a degree to which when you listen to speech and when you're just in general listening probably.|S|Btr002
fe008|but it shows specifically this to this task that it's very constructive.|S|Btr002
fe008|you're not going on simply the auditory there's a huge contribution from the top down processing.|S|Btr002
fe008|and the you know different types.|S|Btr002
fe008|you've got the contextual information.|S|Btr002
fe008|you have syntax.|S|Btr002
fe008|you have your mastery of english and these various things.|S|Btr002
fe008|but i think these kinds of errors it just shows the degree which it's not strictly an acoustic task.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|oh yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|and the other thing i think that's interesting is the types of the types of confusions that happen um do preserve certain aspects of the stimulus.|S|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|so the stress tends to be preserved.|S|Btr002
fe008|you know the content word will be substituted for another content word.|S|Btr002
fe008|and um|F|Btr002
fe008|it's it's not surprising that they would hear this.|S|Btr002
fe008|i'm i'm often surprised by how how plausible something can be with without it being correct.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|because it really seems like it's|D|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and then often you know it's um there's the parentheses are used.|S|Btr002
fe008|so the person knew it wasn't really a perfect match.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|but uh|F|Btr002
fe008|okay now having said that i'm i'm impressed by how by how um well how infrequent these these kinds of extreme cases are.|S|Btr002
fe008|most of the types of things that i find in checking are much much more mild.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah so so|F|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|do you want to|D|Btr002
fe068|actually that comes back to a point.|S|Btr002
fe068|we had talked about this last week where you were interested in so.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe068|saying so at the end of something.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe068|and sometimes that would get transcribed as|D|Btr002
fe068|okay so let me just think of an example.|S|Btr002
fe068|um|F|Btr002
fe068|okay let's say i say well that would be hard to do so.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe068|okay right?|Q|Btr002
fe068|and the way i would transcribe it i would put that so that would be hard comma so.|S|Btr002
fe068|at the end.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe068|because it's kind of just the end of that the|D|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|would you put a period after so?|Q|Btr002
fe068|right.|S|Btr002
me070|you would or you wouldn't?|Q|Btr002
fe068|so|F|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah i would just sort of end it.|S|Btr002
me070|yes.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|S|Btr002
fe068|but then sometimes they transcribe it like so that would be a problem period new word like capitalized so.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh.|B|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|right.|S|Btr002
fe069|oh like it's a whole new utterance.|S|Btr002
fe069|like it's not connected.|S|Btr002
fe068|right and and it just seems to totally that that's not the meaning.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe068|and and it changes the meaning i think.|S|Btr002
fe068|um|F|Btr002
fe008|in a way|D|Btr002
fe008|so uh let me be sure i understand.|S|Btr002
fe008|so you're saying|D|Btr002
fe008|boy it's hard to uh that ignore that word!|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|um|F|Btr002
fe008|so the example is that would be hard.|S|Btr002
fe068|or whatever yeah.|S|Btr002
fe068|that would be a problem.|S|Btr002
fe008|that'd be a problem.|S|Btr002
fe068|whatever.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|so|F|Btr002
fe068|so|F|Btr002
fe008|and how does it change the meaning?|Q|Btr002
fe008|what's what are the two different meanings there?|Q|Btr002
fe068|it seems like because if i was just reading that thing i would say so that would be a problem so.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
fe068|you know what i mean?|Q|Btr002
fe068|if if it was like period capital s.o. as opposed to um that would be a problem so.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh i see what you're saying.|S|Btr002
fe068|that would be a problem so.|S|Btr002
me070|right|F|Btr002
fe066|it it|D|Btr002
me070|i think the second one where the so is all by itself it's like so that would be a problem so.|S|Btr002
me070|you know the so is like disconnected from the|D|Btr002
fe066|right as though it's leading into something else.|S|Btr002
fe069|it's like kind of like introducing|D|Btr002
me070|yeah the first one is like the so is connected to the sentence.|S|Btr002
fe066|bu and|D|Btr002
me070|and that'd be a problem so.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|you know it's but the next one is like not not connected to that would be a problem.|S|Btr002
me070|it's like so.|S|Btr002
fe069|it's like introducing a new thing that they don't talk about.|S|Btr002
fe066|a new subject.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah less|D|Btr002
fe068|right yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|the first one too is more like|D|Btr002
fe068|so|D|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|to me i don't necessarily put um like a a a a period after that so.|S|Btr002
fe066|i might actually either put a dash after it depending on whether or not they got interrupted or something.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|or i would maybe even act as though they were um just trailing off.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe066|so put that those two dots after it.|S|Btr002
me070|i do that too.|S|Btr002
fe066|um uh which depending on what's going on like i'll do that.|S|Btr002
fe066|because to me it sounds more like they're trailing off.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
me070|sometimes though it does sound like they ended a sentence.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|and then i do|D|Btr002
fe066|yeah yeah yeah yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|like sometimes it's just like that'd be hard so.|S|Btr002
fe068|right.|S|Btr002
me070|you know and but and then often it sounds like they were trying to think of something else to say.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|but they couldn't really you know|D|Btr002
me070|and then they get interrupted and then i put a dash.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|yep.|B|Btr002
me070|you know but i never usually put period and then new word so unless it's like end of the sentence and then so.|S|Btr002
fe069|what are we going to do now.|S|Btr002
fe069|but they don't say that.|S|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|it's it's interesting that there are so many cases.|S|Btr002
fe008|and i agree.|S|Btr002
fe008|i i think those are very good conventions.|S|Btr002
fe008|i also like you know this this whole point about how how that the fact that you're raising this|D|Btr002
fe008|i i like this example that um we have several things that are being cued by intonation.|S|Btr002
fe068|right.|S|Btr002
fe008|because if if that's a nice full falling intonational contour on that's a problem.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|uh that'll be a problem.|S|Btr002
fe008|then i would think that there should be a period there.|S|Btr002
fe066|period right.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|right.|S|Btr002
fe008|and then especially if you've got a pause following it.|S|Btr002
fe008|but you don't always|D|Btr002
fe008|these things are correlated but they're not perfect.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|that's another thing is if you're not a native speaker of english you might not pick up.|S|Btr002
fe066|because uh you know every language has different um intonation mappings.|S|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|yeah that's always one of the hardest parts about the native speakers.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|and|D|Btr002
me070|is you don't know exactly like how to do the punctuation.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
me070|because their intonation is totally different.|S|Btr002
fe008|you mean non native non native speakers.|S|Btr002
me070|i mean non native speakers is what i meant yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|absolutely yeah absolutely.|S|Btr002
fe066|and also if you're a non native speaker transcribing it you wouldn't necessarily uh understand the conventions of english intonation as you know intimately as a native speaker might.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah that's true.|S|Btr002
me070|right uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|well i would hope they would have native speaker transcribers transcribing.|S|Btr002
fe008|ideally wouldn't that be something?|S|Btr002
fe008|ideally it would be nice to have like a spaniard transcribing the|D|Btr002
fe069|oh yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh is that what you mean?|Q|Btr002
fe008|or|D|Btr002
fe069|no that's not what i meant.|S|Btr002
me070|oh.|S|Btr002
fe069|but that would be cool.|S|Btr002
fe008|that'd be nice.|S|Btr002
fe069|no what i meant was that i would hope that for meetings in english you would have native speakers transcribing it.|S|Btr002
fe069|because it you would have more intuitions about what should be there.|S|Btr002
fe008|i agree.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|even if you can't fully understand the word you can make a guess you can that isn't completely off like some of these are.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe069|but they're pretty rare.|S|Btr002
fe069|those things the|D|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|the really bad mistakes that they make are pretty rare.|S|Btr002
fe069|i think so.|S|Btr002
fe008|i i so in terms of like when you're going through the tigerfish transcripts you don't find a lot of these kinds of extreme cases.|S|Btr002
fe069|not this|D|Btr002
fe066|not so much no.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
fe069|i mean|D|Btr002
me070|huh not twosome gruesome.|S|Btr002
fe069|no not twosome gruesome.|S|Btr002
fe069|sometimes.|S|Btr002
fe069|but they tend to be pretty good about parentheses.|S|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Btr002
fe008|good good to hear.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah sometimes they they usually put them in parentheses.|S|Btr002
me070|and you think to yourself you were way off.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|but at least you knew you were way off.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|exactly.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah i just wonder like what influences them to think of twosome gruesome.|S|Btr002
fe008|good.|B|Btr002
fe068|like maybe this person just saw a horror movie or something.|S|Btr002
fe068|and|F|Btr002
fe068|uh this is the interpretation that came to mind or something.|S|Btr002
fe008|it's could be.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|you know what i mean?|Q|Btr002
fe068|like where would you get the word gruesome?|Q|Btr002
fe069|i don't know.|S|Btr002
fe068|you know you just sort of pull it out of the air.|S|Btr002
fe069|well i mean you get the g.r. from groups i guess.|S|Btr002
fe068|anyway.|S|Btr002
fe069|but|F|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|i don't know where the rest of it came from.|S|Btr002
me070|uh groups of.|S|Btr002
me070|gruesome.|S|Btr002
fe066|group.|S|Btr002
fe068|okay.|S|Btr002
fe066|groups of.|S|Btr002
fe066|gruesome.|S|Btr002
me070|you've got the uh s. in the middle.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah if you if for some reason they didn't hear the f. if they didn't hear the fuh it might just sound like|D|Btr002
me070|gruesome.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah uh gruesuh.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah it's both labial at the end.|S|Btr002
fe066|you know and then you would kind of have to come up with some sort of consonant.|S|Btr002
fe069|groups of|D|Btr002
fe066|and maybe it's an m. to you.|S|Btr002
fe069|well also|D|Btr002
fe068|right.|F|Btr002
fe069|group of groups of groups of group|D|Btr002
fe066|fff because also i mean f. is fff is um fff|D|Btr002
me070|gruesome groups of gruesome groups of|D|Btr002
fe069|i wonder where the p. went though.|S|Btr002
fe066|right fff because it's|D|Btr002
me070|maybe the p. wasn't pronounced very well.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|like groups of.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah because it's um bilabial too.|S|Btr002
fe066|fff you know you'll|D|Btr002
fe066|uh or interdental fff.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|you know it's close enough i guess to huh you know.|S|Btr002
fe069|nnn i guess.|S|Btr002
fe066|you're getting the closure of the lips.|S|Btr002
fe066|so maybe that's what they were getting.|S|Btr002
fe066|i don't know.|S|Btr002
fe069|it's possible.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|well you know there's also this problem that they didn't have context to constrain the interpretation.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|because|D|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|yeah that's really hard.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay.|D|Btr002
me070|to not be able to go and listen to the other channels and figure out the context of what it's occurring in.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|yeah when i'm clearing the parentheses i find that very useful.|S|Btr002
fe008|i i sometimes i try to just go through and pick up the parentheses.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|see if i can do it just by itself.|S|Btr002
fe008|but it it's remarkable how sometimes something can be so totally opaque.|S|Btr002
fe008|and then you go back to you know the person's previous utterance.|S|Btr002
fe008|or you go to the mixed channel.|S|Btr002
fe008|or you uh check on the other things.|S|Btr002
fe008|and suddenly it becomes perfectly clear.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|it's very very surprising.|S|Btr002
fe008|very surprising.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|good.|B|Btr002
fe068|but this other business um that you have at the bottom with people getting transcribed on another channel.|S|Btr002
fe008|yes.|B|Btr002
fe068|is uh is much more common.|S|Btr002
fe069|is that what it's about?|Q|Btr002
fe069|i wasn't i couldn't i don't know for some reason that didn't make sense to me.|S|Btr002
fe069|but it's about when things are transcribed on other channels than what they're set on.|S|Btr002
fe068|right.|S|Btr002
fe069|okay.|S|Btr002
fe068|and what's always funny to me is when it's you know they miss the gender completely.|S|Btr002
fe068|like you know morgan will be on jane's channel.|S|Btr002
fe068|or just something bizarre like that.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|um so|F|Btr002
fe066|well maybe it's because they don't realize that you're supposed to|D|Btr002
fe066|do they|D|Btr002
fe066|i mean maybe they don't really realize that you're supposed to split it up or something.|S|Btr002
fe066|like they maybe think well i hear it just as clearly.|S|Btr002
fe066|i hear this other person's voice just as clearly.|S|Btr002
fe066|or something.|S|Btr002
fe066|and i realize it's not jane.|S|Btr002
fe066|and i realize it's not a female even.|S|Btr002
fe066|but um because it's so clear on this channel i'm supposed to transcribe it.|S|Btr002
fe069|i'm supposed to do it.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|i i'd imagine that's that might be what that is.|S|Btr002
fe069|they probably don't even know how many people are at the meeting or anything.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah it's really an odd task in in a way.|S|Btr002
fe008|because they're they have no clues at all about how dominant the speaker is on the channel they're transcribing.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and the pre-segmenter doesn't give them any or the information either.|S|Btr002
fe008|i'm i'm sure that it's because of the|D|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|wow.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|we're we're really spoiled then with our interface here.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe068|fancy-schmancy.|S|Btr002
fe069|right?|Q|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|i mean it's very useful.|S|Btr002
fe068|if i was going to make just a guess though from my experience it would seem like the men get um|D|Btr002
fe008|yes.|B|Btr002
fe068|the men get moved onto other channels maybe more frequently.|S|Btr002
fe068|and it's just probably because they have deeper voices.|S|Btr002
fe068|and they're getting picked up on more channels um than their own channel.|S|Btr002
fe008|that would make that would make some sense.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe068|um for you know it's an acoustic thing.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay.|D|Btr002
fe069|or they just tend to peak louder maybe.|S|Btr002
fe066|that's true they do they do say that men's voices carry better.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|i mean that's why they use like i|D|Btr002
fe066|who was telling me?|Q|Btr002
fe066|ian maddieson was talking about this that they use male voices in um in um airports.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh!|S|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|because the acoustics of it it just fits into the a hearer's range.|S|Btr002
fe069|for announcements and things?|Q|Btr002
fe066|yeah that's it fits into a hearer's range of perception um better than a lot of female voices.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe068|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|and so that's why they use male voices.|S|Btr002
fe066|we were just talking about that.|S|Btr002
fe069|they should do that at bart too.|S|Btr002
fe069|because sometimes it's hard to hear.|S|Btr002
fe008|i see.|S|Btr002
fe067|and now they have those strange computerized voices that|D|Btr002
fe008|so|F|Btr002
fe069|yeah those are actually probably just the computer problem.|S|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|not the gender problem.|S|Btr002
fe008|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|so so this means that people with hearing problems would hear uh uh one of these announcements better if it were a male voice then.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah depending on their auditory um capabilities.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Btr002
fe066|i mean if their auditory capabilities uh have been you know um squished down like in a certain place where it would be easier for a person with normal um hearing to hear a male's voice|D|Btr002
fe066|um like if i'm saying if if they if they had a some sort of um you know damage to part of their brain that processes auditory information then|D|Btr002
fe066|and uh|D|Btr002
fe066|if that part of the brain normally codes for you know male voices uh in a normal hearer then they might not be able to.|S|Btr002
fe066|you know does that make sense?|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh.|S|Btr002
fe066|like if that part is damaged.|S|Btr002
fe066|so but um|F|Btr002
fe008|selective.|S|Btr002
fe066|but yeah if i guess for most hearers it's just easier.|S|Btr002
fe066|and it's like a certain uh kind of like rough male voice too.|S|Btr002
fe066|kind of graspy.|S|Btr002
fe066|raspy i mean.|S|Btr002
fe068|huh.|B|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|apparently.|S|Btr002
fe069|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|is better?|Q|Btr002
fe066|is better.|S|Btr002
fe008|uh it's a wider band then.|S|Btr002
fe008|because of|D|Btr002
fe008|do you think it might be from the|D|Btr002
fe066|yeah i guess so.|S|Btr002
fe008|she asked this question last time which was um whether our system here the recording system may have some of the same channel some sort of channel restrictions such as they ran across when they were looking at telephone uh transmissions at a certain point.|S|Btr002
fe008|because you know telephone transmissions um there's some filtering going on.|S|Btr002
fe008|you don't hear the full the full band of frequencies.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|oh.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and uh i asked a couple of people and they answer came back that|D|Btr002
fe066|it's really interesting.|S|Btr002
fe008|it was an interesting|D|Btr002
fe008|it's reminded me because of the comment about noise.|S|Btr002
fe008|noise being really spreading frequencies across uh using frequencies across a broader spectrum.|S|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|so in a way bandwidth can increase with some of these cases of distortion that we have.|S|Btr002
fe008|but it's it's not a useful kind of increase in frequency range.|S|Btr002
fe066|right yeah i was just saying that it like you know sometimes um if remember i was saying like if there's a discrepancy between fricatives you know like um shuh or suh will show up in a certain part of the spectrum.|S|Btr002
fe066|and and uh oftentimes the fuh is like knocked out of the spectrum by|D|Btr002
fe069|yeah by filtering or something?|Q|Btr002
fe066|um by filtering in some of the older phones.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|and that's why like|D|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|so what was the answer here?|Q|Btr002
fe069|it that's not the case?|Q|Btr002
fe008|answer|D|Btr002
fe066|that they don't|D|Btr002
fe008|that they that they don't.|S|Btr002
fe008|we don't have a reduction in that direction.|S|Btr002
fe069|oh okay.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
me070|oh.|B|Btr002
fe069|good.|S|Btr002
fe008|that uh i mean you know one could have if one had cheaper microphones than we have.|S|Btr002
fe008|but we've got good microphones.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|and another there is sort of an upper limit set on our bandwidth by the sampling rate.|S|Btr002
fe008|but then that becomes|D|Btr002
fe008|so adam's that|D|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|then it becomes a matter of is that something that would be relevant to perceptual range.|S|Btr002
fe008|and i didn't really have the sense that it would.|S|Btr002
fe066|i didn't get that from him actually.|S|Btr002
fe066|i felt like um he's basically saying that for our for all intents and purposes with this it's covering whatever sounds are necessary to be covered like everything.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Btr002
fe008|good i i that was my impression also.|S|Btr002
fe066|that's that's what i|D|Btr002
fe008|it so we don't have that kind of reduction like you have on telephones.|S|Btr002
fe008|and actually in the work that they were doing with the telephone corpora they did run into limitations.|S|Btr002
fe008|and uh certain types that they when what their speech recognition approach.|S|Btr002
fe008|is because of the of the filtering.|S|Btr002
fe068|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|i mean it does seem like when i hear these things except for the distortion parts.|S|Btr002
fe008|where the volume's too high or of course when the volume's too low|D|Btr002
fe008|but that's a different problem.|S|Btr002
fe008|um except for those cases it seems to me that it really is as if the person were speaking in my ear.|S|Btr002
fe008|i don't feel that it's being reduced in any way.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|S|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah that's what it seems like.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah yeah i do too.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah?|Q|Btr002
fe008|and he was saying in the in the uh areas where you have clipping where it's recorded too high and and it starts to saturate and you have trouble.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|um i thought that was very interesting.|S|Btr002
fe008|so bandwidth then gets gets actually wider instead of narrower.|S|Btr002
fe008|because you have|D|Btr002
fe008|um|F|Btr002
fe008|uhoh!|S|Btr002
fe008|you have these you still have the frequencies are represented.|S|Btr002
fe008|but the energy distributions are thrown off.|S|Btr002
fe008|and um in fact you have also some additional frequencies.|S|Btr002
fe008|so you end up with a wider bandwidth functionally.|S|Btr002
fe008|i mean|D|Btr002
fe066|yeah so like you were saying like in the case of something with clipping.|S|Btr002
fe008|but not helpful for speech.|S|Btr002
fe066|does it were you saying that uh it it increases to or expands to accommodate that?|Q|Btr002
fe066|or|D|Btr002
fe008|no technically the bandwidth is wider than|D|Btr002
fe066|no.|S|Btr002
fe008|so it's actually paradoxical in a way.|S|Btr002
fe008|because you usually think bandwidth better bandwidth is better.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|but in the cases of of distortion than you can end up with|D|Btr002
fe066|right oh okay yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|uh|F|Btr002
fe066|i see what you're saying.|S|Btr002
fe008|a wider bandwidth which isn't useful in terms of understanding speech.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
me070|right.|S|Btr002
fe068|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|so|F|Btr002
fe069|i have a question.|S|Btr002
fe008|yes.|S|Btr002
fe069|in the some of the earlier meetings i guess there was a lot of spikes.|S|Btr002
fe069|or what i called spikes.|S|Btr002
fe008|yes.|S|Btr002
fe069|i was wondering what that is.|S|Btr002
fe069|i don't even know if it's relevant or useful to know.|S|Btr002
fe069|but i'm just curious.|S|Btr002
fe008|one source was there was a problem with a connection.|S|Btr002
fe008|where the microphone went went into a box.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|i was trying trying to think of this as prior to|D|Btr002
fe008|yes it was prior to the wireless.|S|Btr002
fe008|there was a particular connection which wasn't wireless.|S|Btr002
fe008|which was um mechanically bad in some some sense.|S|Btr002
fe069|loose.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and if it got touched it would it would send an impulse.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh.|B|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|in an uh an irrelevant non wanted artifact.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|because those ones sometimes were extraordinarily bad and|D|Btr002
fe066|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|painful.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|i agree absolutely painful.|S|Btr002
me070|they were painful.|S|Btr002
fe008|i agree.|S|Btr002
fe066|uh|F|Btr002
fe008|and that's that's you know i would watch the visual signal to avoid that.|D|Btr002
me070|oh yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|it's like|D|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah and like not listen to them.|D|Btr002
fe066|i do remember those actually.|S|Btr002
me070|and then you see it.|S|Btr002
me070|and off with the headphones.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah you could see it coming and you'd turn the volume down or something.|D|Btr002
fe069|or just uh|D|Btr002
fe066|yeah yeah yeah yeah i remember i had one one with that and it was just all the time.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah or like skip it entirely.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|oh yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|especially if they also got louder too and they hit it.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh!|D|Btr002
fe066|it was just like whoahh!|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah that's really awful.|S|Btr002
fe008|you've noticed that those have gotten better over the intervening.|S|Btr002
fe069|yes absolutely.|S|Btr002
me070|oh yeah uhhuh.|S|Btr002
fe066|yes.|S|Btr002
fe008|good.|S|Btr002
fe068|but sometimes you'll see like something coming up.|S|Btr002
fe068|like uhoh.|S|Btr002
fe068|someone's going to cough really loudly.|S|Btr002
fe068|and i could tell because of the way it looks.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe068|or someone's about to laugh really loudly.|S|Btr002
fe069|and so you turn it down.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|oh.|S|Btr002
fe068|um yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah yeah yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|and then you're just you've got like you know you're sort of like|D|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|take one off or something.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|F|Btr002
fe069|no i think|D|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|so unless there's going to be some speech in there i don't think i need to listen that carefully.|S|Btr002
fe069|i think that's really important.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah i think that's really important.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|because i generally have the volume turned up to above normal volume just so i can hear more clearly.|S|Btr002
fe068|so|F|Btr002
me070|uhhuh yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe069|and if it's like that for someone screeching into the microphone than it would be really painful.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe068|you could really hurt your ears yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|i think you could yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe068|oh yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|i think so too.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe068|so|F|Btr002
fe008|yeah i|D|Btr002
fe069|yeah that's|D|Btr002
fe069|especially we have really good headphones.|S|Btr002
fe008|when i realized|D|Btr002
fe069|like|D|Btr002
fe008|yeah when i realized i i meant to tell everyone to watch that visual signal.|S|Btr002
fe008|because that's that's saved me a bunch of times.|S|Btr002
fe068|gives some good clues.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah i mean it's very useful in like all senses.|S|Btr002
fe069|because|D|Btr002
fe068|oh yeah yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|it's very good.|S|Btr002
fe068|sometimes it doesn't pick up backchanneling though.|S|Btr002
fe068|and so sometimes you have to um try to listen.|S|Btr002
fe069|no.|S|Btr002
fe069|or turn up|D|Btr002
fe068|there's no visual.|S|Btr002
fe068|but|F|Btr002
fe068|yeah you have to the resolution.|S|Btr002
fe068|right.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah or like|D|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|it might be useful to to talk about the interface for for a bit.|S|Btr002
fe068|so|F|Btr002
fe008|in terms of what it is that you like particularly and what you don't.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and uh that kind of thing.|S|Btr002
me070|you know what i would think would be a really um neat feature for the interface?|Q|Btr002
me070|some sort of backwards tab.|S|Btr002
me070|where it could go backwards without you having to go up and do it manually.|S|Btr002
fe008|ooh interesting.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|and you know press the button and juh-juh-juh-juh-juh-juh-juh.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|because if you miss something and you want to go back to it it's such a such a hassle.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|that's true.|S|Btr002
me070|it'd be so nice if there was just some sort of like you know uh opposite of tab that you could hit that it would just sort of move backwards.|S|Btr002
me070|there wouldn't even have to be any um|D|Btr002
fe068|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|but it would play it backwards too.|S|Btr002
me070|i know.|S|Btr002
me070|it you wouldn't even have to have the audio.|S|Btr002
me070|that's not i wouldn't i mean|D|Btr002
fe069|but just to move back but not necessarily a whole timebin?|Q|Btr002
fe068|just to jump it back.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|interesting.|S|Btr002
fe068|right because sometimes you'll hear it'll be in right in the middle of the timebin.|S|Btr002
fe008|huh.|B|Btr002
fe068|and you don't have to listen to the whole thing again.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe068|because you've already gotten the first part.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|oh yeah yeah.|S|Btr002
fe068|so you just want it to go back|D|Btr002
fe068|i don't know.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah some|D|Btr002
fe066|and otherwise you have to drag it.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah some timebins are humongous.|S|Btr002
fe069|or otherwise drag it or like click on it.|S|Btr002
me070|and if you miss it you know you've got to go back and find it.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|and dragging it and looking for it and you may not be able to see it even.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|you know.|S|Btr002
fe068|that's true.|S|Btr002
fe069|i think that would be useful.|S|Btr002
fe068|huh yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|interesting idea.|S|Btr002
fe008|i'll i'll i'll suggest that to the charer.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah the less you have to click on the mouse i think the faster you could go.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah because i noticed i started feeling like i was getting some sort of carpal tunnel issues.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe068|yeah you were having some wrist problems and stuff.|S|Btr002
fe069|much better now that i have the keyboard tray.|S|Btr002
fe068|right?|Q|Btr002
fe069|but it was|D|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|i think because i had my hand in one position using it all the time.|S|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|and that i would it would crack a lot.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah ooh!|S|Btr002
fe069|it was very weird.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|but|D|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|D|Btr002
fe008|that's it's good to be careful about the mousing.|S|Btr002
fe008|you were going to say?|Q|Btr002
fe066|oh yeah um something um maybe i just don't know how to do this.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|but when i want to expand a timebin back|D|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|or even forward.|S|Btr002
fe066|i'll use the mouse.|S|Btr002
fe066|the middle|D|Btr002
fe008|how do you mean expand?|Q|Btr002
fe008|what do you mean by expand?|Q|Btr002
fe066|oh uh in terms of um if uh if it's it's if it's cut off.|S|Btr002
fe066|like the beginning of an utterance.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|oh i see what you're saying.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay okay.|S|Btr002
fe066|i'll move it move the line back.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|and i usually just use the mouse.|S|Btr002
fe066|how do you do that with the keyboard?|Q|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|really ? oh i do that with the keyboard.|S|Btr002
fe069|well i would press tab.|S|Btr002
fe068|i do that with the mouse yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|and listen to where i wanted it to stop.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|and then press return create a new timebin.|S|Btr002
me070|return.|S|Btr002
me070|and then|D|Btr002
fe066|oh.|S|Btr002
fe069|and then shift|D|Btr002
me070|and then shift|D|Btr002
fe069|shift what is it?|Q|Btr002
me070|backspace.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh okay so you just do it that way.|S|Btr002
fe069|shift backspace to collapse it yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|that's that's what i do.|S|Btr002
fe066|okay okay.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|i do it all on the keyboard.|S|Btr002
fe068|oh!|S|Btr002
fe066|okay to me that's takes longer than to do it with the mouse.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|oh do you drag do you drag the line?|S|Btr002
me070|oh really?|Q|Btr002
fe066|because you can just click|D|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|i just drag the line.|S|Btr002
fe069|see i never i never do that for some reason.|S|Btr002
me070|i don't do that either.|D|Btr002
fe067|i didn't even even know you could do that.|S|Btr002
fe008|i vary.|S|Btr002
fe008|i i should it depends on how much i want to go back.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|and how certain the boundary is.|S|Btr002
fe008|if i can see it if it's if i can see this thing's coming up and it's just so clear.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh yeah that's true.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|it's that mountain right there i can tell then|D|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|right then i'll drag it.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|yeah dragging is really efficient.|S|Btr002
fe008|but if it's like a mess in there then it helps me to be able to locate it with the actual clicking.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|right.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and then do this what you were just describing.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|but um|F|Btr002
fe069|um one thing that's gotten me into problems a little bit is having the shift-backspace as the collapser.|S|Btr002
fe066|uh yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|because i'll tend to delete things.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|or go too far or something.|S|Btr002
fe069|or i'll be holding down shift because i want to type something as a capital.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe068|oh yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|yep yep yep yep.|S|Btr002
fe069|and then end up collapsing the timebins.|S|Btr002
me070|and and then collapse it.|S|Btr002
fe066|yep.|B|Btr002
fe066|yep.|B|Btr002
me070|i did that so much.|S|Btr002
fe069|so it might be better to use a different keys or something.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh that's annoying.|S|Btr002
fe066|yep.|B|Btr002
fe008|this if i were to|D|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|if i were to add an option it might be to have an undo for that.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah yeah.|S|Btr002
fe067|oh that'd be good that would be good.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|because i have had that happen.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah that would be nice.|S|Btr002
fe066|that would be great.|S|Btr002
fe069|or just i mean|D|Btr002
fe008|yeah good.|D|Btr002
fe066|i've erased entire utterances before accidentally.|S|Btr002
fe069|but or just to change the keys used you know for for that option.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah i'm rather used to it now though.|S|Btr002
fe069|i'm used to it too.|S|Btr002
fe069|but i mean|D|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|but then when you go to type on your keyboard at home.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh you're so scared!|S|Btr002
fe066|do you do this too?|Q|Btr002
fe066|i'm so scared.|S|Btr002
fe066|like i i won't hold shift down|D|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|to to hold shift down while you're backspacing?|Q|Btr002
fe066|i won't do it.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|F|Btr002
me070|you're typing capitals and you're backspacing and you're like oh take the shift off.|S|Btr002
me070|i'll collapse everything.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|i'm just like what am i doing.|S|Btr002
me070|i totally do that now.|S|Btr002
fe069|i don't think i'm that bad.|S|Btr002
fe069|but|F|Btr002
fe066|yeah yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|oh yeah i do find that the keyboard is different here than it is even at my for my school computer.|S|Btr002
fe008|huh.|B|Btr002
fe068|and so i'll i'll just be|D|Btr002
fe068|if i was just at school and i come here it's just|D|Btr002
me070|oh yeah.|S|Btr002
fe068|or vice versa.|S|Btr002
fe068|it's just uh it's like i'll i'll reach for one key and it'll do something completely different.|S|Btr002
me070|or vice versa yeah.|S|Btr002
fe068|and i have to just get used just get used to it again.|S|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|that backspace and the little|D|Btr002
fe068|yeah the backspace is in the wrong place.|S|Btr002
me070|and the yeah that little evil apostrophe that keeps showing up.|S|Btr002
fe067|the little accent thingy.|S|Btr002
fe067|right.|S|Btr002
me070|i don't want you.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah i do that too.|S|Btr002
fe068|oh yeah and then i'll keep i keep caps locking too.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh.|B|Btr002
fe068|because the caps-lock's in a different spot.|S|Btr002
me070|oh yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|so|F|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|oh.|B|Btr002
fe008|how do you get i don't know the evil apostrophe?|Q|Btr002
fe069|it's just right above the backspace.|S|Btr002
me070|um yeah it's one of the backspaces on the keyboards that most of us are probably used to.|S|Btr002
fe067|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|oh oh!|S|Btr002
me070|so you want to backspace and you get apostrophe apostrophe apostrophe apostrophe.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah yeah yeah yeah.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|yeah you're like no.|S|Btr002
fe008|i see.|S|Btr002
fe068|oh.|F|Btr002
fe068|yeah i do that all the time.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|okay so this is the difference between the p.c. keyboard and the sun keyboard.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|so like i only have one i have one versus two of the others.|S|Btr002
fe069|i think so.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe067|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|did it|D|Btr002
fe069|right.|S|Btr002
fe008|is that right?|Q|Btr002
me070|right i i'm used to it now too.|S|Btr002
fe008|so it's|D|Btr002
fe069|i'm actually used to|D|Btr002
fe069|i'm used to the sun one i guess now.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|but then like i think there's a different keyboard on|D|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|i always forget|D|Btr002
fe066|oh linguine than on um|D|Btr002
fe008|there's|D|Btr002
fe008|basmati?|Q|Btr002
fe066|no the other one.|S|Btr002
fe008|amaretto?|Q|Btr002
fe066|amaretto.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
fe069|amaretto has a different one.|S|Btr002
fe069|linguine is basmati have the same.|S|Btr002
fe066|right and it's and i always use i tend to use linguine.|S|Btr002
fe069|right?|Q|Btr002
fe066|but the last couple times like you've stolen linguine before i can get to it.|S|Btr002
fe069|ooh!|S|Btr002
fe066|i can get to it.|S|Btr002
fe066|so i go onto amaretto.|S|Btr002
fe066|which is fine.|S|Btr002
fe066|but then like um it takes me a good like ten minutes to get reused to that keyboard.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|and so i keep|D|Btr002
fe068|i don't know.|S|Btr002
fe068|you seem very upset about it.|S|Btr002
fe068|so we maybe we should trade.|S|Btr002
fe066|no it's really okay.|S|Btr002
fe066|but yeah i i i have noticed that i'll screw some stuff up like when i'm trying to get|D|Btr002
fe008|so which|D|Btr002
fe069|but just the beginning.|S|Btr002
fe008|i i've forgotten which one is which.|S|Btr002
fe008|so which one do you prefer?|Q|Btr002
fe008|is it is it the so if we had a show of hands how many people would vote for the sun keyboard versus the|D|Btr002
me070|okay.|B|Btr002
fe008|so let's put it the other way.|S|Btr002
fe008|how many people would not vote for the sun keyboard?|Q|Btr002
fe008|would vote for the other one.|S|Btr002
fe008|the p.c.p.c. keyboard.|S|Btr002
fe069|which is the|D|Btr002
fe066|the p. c?|Q|Btr002
me070|the p.c. one?|Q|Btr002
fe066|i would vote for the p.c.|S|Btr002
fe069|the p.c. one is the amaretto one.|S|Btr002
fe069|right?|Q|Btr002
fe008|i don't know.|S|Btr002
fe008|i i'm not sure.|S|Btr002
fe008|it's the|D|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe068|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|i'm not sure which one is which.|S|Btr002
fe066|or no.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|i just get used to it.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhoh.|S|Btr002
fe068|so|F|Btr002
me070|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|i like the linguine keyboard.|S|Btr002
fe067|yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|i mean like when i first had started working i would have definitely wanted the p.c. keyboard.|S|Btr002
fe008|the linguine is okay.|S|Btr002
fe066|that's all i know.|S|Btr002
me070|but now i'm i'm just used to it.|S|Btr002
fe008|you're|D|Btr002
fe069|i prefer i prefer the one on linguine or basmati.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|i don't know what it's called.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay let's do it that way.|S|Btr002
fe067|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|so so if we if we have a map of the room the one when you first walk in|D|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe068|is basmati.|S|Btr002
fe069|oh.|S|Btr002
fe066|to the left|D|Btr002
fe008|the one on the left is that basmati?|Q|Btr002
fe067|by the light switch yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|yep.|B|Btr002
fe068|i believe that's correct yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
fe068|linguine must be the one in the left hand corner.|S|Btr002
fe008|and|D|Btr002
me070|it's the one in in that corner right?|S|Btr002
fe066|linguine is the one in the corner.|S|Btr002
fe069|in the|D|Btr002
me070|that that has the p.c.|S|Btr002
me070|right?|D|Btr002
fe069|yeah the one in the|D|Btr002
fe008|and then the the far right corner as you walk in?|Q|Btr002
me070|yeah yeah that's that one's got the the p.c. keyboard.|S|Btr002
me070|and then the two on those sides have the um sun keyboard.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah so basically right as you walk in the door the one straight ahead of you is amaretto.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|S|Btr002
fe008|yep.|S|Btr002
fe068|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|and the one to the left of that against the far corner is linguine.|S|Btr002
fe008|good.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
fe068|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and the one close to you is basmati.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay so now who would've|D|Btr002
me070|yes.|S|Btr002
fe008|so if you have a strong|D|Btr002
fe008|now you're bi-keyboardal.|S|Btr002
fe008|so|F|Btr002
me070|uh yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|but|D|Btr002
fe008|but um|F|Btr002
fe066|nice.|S|Btr002
fe008|who who would prefer the keyboard on linguine?|Q|Btr002
fe008|okay we got two votes for linguine.|S|Btr002
fe008|and who would prefer amaretto?|Q|Btr002
fe008|amaretto.|S|Btr002
fe008|so we got more more multi-keyboardal people.|S|Btr002
fe067|ready.|S|Btr002
fe068|i just have no preference.|S|Btr002
fe008|well that's lovely.|S|Btr002
fe067|yeah it doesn't really matter.|S|Btr002
fe008|same here?|Q|Btr002
me070|yeah.|D|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|D|Btr002
fe008|excellent.|S|Btr002
fe067|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay so|D|Btr002
fe068|it just goofs me up for like maybe a minute.|S|Btr002
fe068|and then i sort of get used to it.|S|Btr002
me070|exactly exactly.|S|Btr002
fe069|i i could get used to i could get used to it too.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah i could get used to it too.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|i just am very used to|D|Btr002
fe068|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|right.|S|Btr002
fe069|i don't know.|S|Btr002
fe069|because i always use it.|S|Btr002
fe008|i i see.|S|Btr002
fe008|i i have experienced this keyboard conflict.|S|Btr002
fe008|and with me the things that are confusing are where the control key is.|S|Btr002
fe008|so i end up|D|Btr002
fe069|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|pressing shifts and control keys whenever i want the other one whichever it is.|S|Btr002
me070|oh that's true.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|i forgot about that one.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|huh.|B|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|i could easily put a p.c. keyboard in there if anyone had|D|Btr002
fe008|i we already have one.|S|Btr002
fe008|i could add another one.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|we so you know maybe let me know if you want it to have it shifted.|S|Btr002
me070|i'm|D|Btr002
fe008|but um|F|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|that's good.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh let me see.|S|Btr002
fe008|so um i i wanted to um maybe comment a little more on the interface in terms of what aspects of it are helpful in this.|S|Btr002
fe008|i know we had this interface for a time when people were doing marking of the numbers.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and um um|F|Btr002
fe008|i've forgotten someone said that they could recognize a seven when they saw it they could see the the waveform and oh it's going to be a seven.|S|Btr002
me070|oh wow.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|i i remember recognizing certain numbers.|S|Btr002
fe069|i huh i don't remember which ones.|S|Btr002
fe069|but i think it was maybe|D|Btr002
fe069|well i could recognize when there was a fricative at the beginning of a number for some reason.|S|Btr002
fe069|it was like a little bit of energy or whatever you call it.|S|Btr002
fe069|and then it grew really big.|S|Btr002
fe069|so like four and five and three all had this same characteristic.|S|Btr002
fe069|and six and seven both had the same characteristics to their in the beginnings.|S|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|but six and eight.|S|Btr002
fe069|eight um i remember tended that people tended to not pronounce the last t. .|S|Btr002
fe008|oh.|S|Btr002
fe069|and when they did it was slightly farther away from the rest of the word than you would have expected.|S|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|same with six.|S|Btr002
fe069|the x. well the k.s. or whatever at the end.|S|Btr002
fe068|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|but|F|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|that was a that was really interesting to notice that.|S|Btr002
fe069|uh|F|Btr002
fe069|it's a very different interface though.|S|Btr002
fe069|i mean it seems very strange.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh it is different.|S|Btr002
fe008|well it it would it had the benefit of it|D|Btr002
fe008|so this this was to handle the digits uh only.|S|Btr002
me070|okay.|B|Btr002
fe008|which is what you figure.|S|Btr002
fe008|and um did you i thought you might have done that joel.|S|Btr002
fe008|did you also?|Q|Btr002
me070|nn huh no.|S|Btr002
fe008|so two people did that um i thought.|S|Btr002
fe068|i did it a little.|S|Btr002
fe008|did you do it?|Q|Btr002
fe008|i thought so.|S|Btr002
fe008|good good.|S|Btr002
fe068|just a little bit.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|okay.|F|Btr002
fe069|yeah i only did it a little bit too.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah what happened to that?|Q|Btr002
fe068|you just stopped doing it?|Q|Btr002
fe068|or|D|Btr002
fe008|well i think that we'll bring it back.|S|Btr002
fe068|oh okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|the|D|Btr002
me070|this was a different interface entirely?|Q|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|uh adam wrote this as uh using the same uh computer language as channeltrans is written in.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|D|Btr002
fe008|and what it would do is present you with the digit string that the person was supposed to have said.|S|Btr002
fe008|and then you would listen to it.|S|Btr002
fe008|and the|D|Btr002
fe008|there were two parts to the task.|S|Btr002
fe008|one of them was to see if that's what they actually said.|S|Btr002
fe008|and to indicate you know in the transcribe errors of it.|S|Btr002
fe066|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and then the other aspect was to tighten the timebins.|S|Btr002
fe008|and those data were actually used in some analyses which showed uh very very good results.|S|Btr002
fe068|right.|B|Btr002
fe068|good.|S|Btr002
me070|oh wow.|S|Btr002
fe008|and so it shows|D|Btr002
fe008|i mean it's it's useful.|S|Btr002
fe008|this is this is why we do these digits.|S|Btr002
fe008|it's a nice standard task.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and you have lots of different voices.|S|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and it's very clear.|S|Btr002
fe008|you know what the canonical answer is when a person says a number.|S|Btr002
fe008|um at least most of the time you know what number it was they said.|S|Btr002
fe008|so its|D|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|ground truth as they call it is very clear.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|so|F|Btr002
fe008|but i it was um really rather minimal.|S|Btr002
fe008|i mean i i like that interface.|S|Btr002
fe008|very efficient.|S|Btr002
fe008|and really is um i think that we'll probably use it for getting the digits refined in terms of their timebins.|S|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|if i remember correctly it seemed to be very efficient in the key strokes that you used to do certain things.|S|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|i can't remember what they were now.|S|Btr002
fe069|but i just remember that it was once you learned them it was very neat and concise.|S|Btr002
fe069|and like|D|Btr002
fe008|excellent.|S|Btr002
fe069|couple keys that you used.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah the hardest thing'd be finding them.|S|Btr002
fe069|huh.|B|Btr002
fe068|because i would get the whole i'd get the whole transcript of the meeting.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh that's right.|S|Btr002
fe068|and you had to find them.|S|Btr002
fe068|you'd have to find where the digits were.|S|Btr002
fe069|oh.|S|Btr002
fe068|and they'd usually be at the end somewhere.|S|Btr002
me070|oh wow.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh.|B|Btr002
fe068|but you had to figure out where the heck in the meeting to to look for them.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|that's right.|D|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe068|so|F|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|i also think that wasn't this a stage where some of these meetings hadn't been transcribed.|S|Btr002
fe008|so i don't think you could use a string search right?|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|D|Btr002
fe008|i mean i was trying to remember how that worked.|S|Btr002
me070|huh.|D|Btr002
fe008|but it was difficult finding them for some reason.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|yep.|B|Btr002
fe008|well it was also like you|D|Btr002
fe068|yeah the interface was different.|S|Btr002
fe068|i i yeah.|S|Btr002
fe068|it was it was more complicated.|S|Btr002
fe008|that's a down side.|S|Btr002
fe068|but anyway.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe068|than what it would be now.|S|Btr002
fe068|so|F|Btr002
fe008|actually you you also did a different type of transcription uh with respect to um our sister project.|S|Btr002
fe008|the smartkom project.|S|Btr002
fe008|which involved listening to people who were supposed to be wandering through germany.|S|Btr002
me070|oh right.|B|Btr002
fe008|and this is supposed to be something that would be useful in developing an interface to help them find their way.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|so um someone else did that too.|S|Btr002
fe008|i've forgotten who who else did that.|S|Btr002
fe008|did anybody else here do that?|Q|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
fe069|i feel like i did a little checking or something on that.|S|Btr002
fe008|actually i think you might have done this also as i think about it.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah i don't know i don't remember actually transcribing it.|S|Btr002
fe069|but i remember listening to.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh.|F|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh so actually we started with the words.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|and it was a matter then of trying to find the most efficient way to match the words up with the with the actual sounds.|S|Btr002
fe008|because they were reading from a script.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|right.|S|Btr002
fe066|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and then there was some conversation in addition that that um needed to be transcribed.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|but um|F|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|one thing that you learn with this interface right away is that if you have really really really long utterances it's extremely inefficient to do anything.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|because you end up|D|Btr002
fe008|if you try to go up in the transcript you end up with this huge huge space of time.|S|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|yep.|S|Btr002
fe008|and things covering several screens.|S|Btr002
fe008|and it's just horribly inefficient.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|so|F|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|one thing that i still can't figure out with the interface.|S|Btr002
fe069|it does this sometimes.|S|Btr002
fe069|but other times it doesn't.|S|Btr002
fe069|is when you click on|D|Btr002
fe069|you know there's a bar above where this sound wave is that has um the|D|Btr002
fe069|it has a little bar of where the meeting is.|S|Btr002
fe069|like in|D|Btr002
fe008|yes.|B|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|and it goes along as you're listening to the meeting.|S|Btr002
fe069|and then it ends up the end.|S|Btr002
fe069|and if you click on that bar to the right of that little marker then it moves forward.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|if you click on the left it moves back.|S|Btr002
fe069|but sometimes it moves two frames or two screens.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|oh yes.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|i've noticed that.|S|Btr002
fe069|and sometimes it doesn't.|S|Btr002
fe008|i think that's totally dependent on how you have the resolution set.|S|Btr002
fe008|so that little tiny thing.|S|Btr002
fe069|really?|Q|Btr002
fe008|and if i increase the resolution so it's spread out a bit more then i seem to have more control over it.|S|Btr002
fe069|okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|but i don't have|D|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|because i noticed that a few times it would do it it would move twice|D|Btr002
fe066|that kind of makes sense.|S|Btr002
fe008|yes.|S|Btr002
fe069|and then in sometimes it wouldn't.|S|Btr002
fe066|because|D|Btr002
fe066|yeah|D|Btr002
fe069|and maybe maybe i had resolution set differently.|S|Btr002
fe066|because yeah if the the resolution if it's moving too slowly then like if you were to click on some place then it makes sense that it would get kind of confused.|S|Btr002
fe069|or i|D|Btr002
fe066|but if it's moving quickly seems that it's covering more ground faster.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|so i don't know.|S|Btr002
fe008|i'm going to report that to him.|S|Btr002
fe008|because i i've i know|D|Btr002
fe008|that's one of the reasons why when i uh suggested to visual scan the record that i suggested doing it by clicking on the right of the of that navigation bar you're mentioning.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|or actually clicking on the right of the sound wave and then letting it run past the boundary.|S|Btr002
fe069|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|because i had the same problem.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah that's what i tend to do is i use a soundwave.|S|Btr002
fe008|it's|D|Btr002
fe069|but if i'm trying to scan through a long period of what appears to be silence sometimes i'll ry and be try to scan it.|S|Btr002
fe008|because you always know|D|Btr002
fe008|yes.|B|Btr002
fe008|yeah much more|D|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|but i can't.|S|Btr002
fe069|because|D|Btr002
fe008|because you end up missing entire frames.|S|Btr002
fe069|it skips yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|so then i end up clicking on the arrow they have the arrow at the far right.|S|Btr002
fe008|i was surprised by that.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|yes okay okay.|S|Btr002
fe069|and so i use that sometimes.|S|Btr002
fe008|so on the on that on that bar you were describing clicking.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|at the far right and far left there's a little arrow that allows you to go like second by second or something.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
me070|i didn't know about that.|S|Btr002
fe069|i don't know.|S|Btr002
me070|really?|Q|Btr002
fe069|not second by second.|S|Btr002
fe069|but little bit by bit yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|so is this the arrow on the right?|Q|Btr002
me070|oh.|S|Btr002
fe008|it would be underneath that little resolution bar?|Q|Btr002
fe008|i mean it's like in that cluster up there.|S|Btr002
fe069|um it's not on the resolution part.|S|Btr002
fe069|it's where you have it's where you have the marker of where you are in the meeting.|S|Btr002
fe069|so you have this bar uh and then you have a time marker that moves along.|S|Btr002
fe069|say you're halfway through the meeting it's going to be halfway along the line.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|i have to do something visually.|S|Btr002
fe008|so my i would say you have the transcript screen.|S|Btr002
fe008|and then you have a bar.|S|Btr002
fe008|i think you're referring to this bar aren't you?|S|Btr002
fe069|i think|D|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|and then there's like this little resolution changer.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|it's|D|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|and then down here you have the soundwave.|S|Btr002
fe008|and then something down here.|S|Btr002
fe069|exactly.|S|Btr002
me070|oh.|D|Btr002
fe008|and then you got the the different channels come out.|S|Btr002
fe069|so right at the right and left of that|D|Btr002
fe008|so right in here you have this bar that you move and as as you go along it|D|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|okay so is are you saying?|D|Btr002
me070|oh that!|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|you saying that there's an arrow right here?|Q|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay and then there's an arrow right here?|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|so you can|D|Btr002
fe069|exactly.|S|Btr002
me070|oh does|D|Btr002
me070|that doesn't|D|Btr002
fe066|i usually just don't use that i think.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah that skips|D|Btr002
me070|oh is that what you're talking about?|Q|Btr002
fe066|oh.|B|Btr002
me070|if you use that|D|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|i've never used been able to use that.|S|Btr002
me070|because it i feel like it skips such huge portions.|S|Btr002
fe069|maybe we have resolution set totally different.|S|Btr002
fe067|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|because i noticed when jen and i have totally different resolutions.|S|Btr002
me070|maybe we do.|S|Btr002
fe069|because hers moves so much quicker than mine.|S|Btr002
fe066|i tend to make it move fast.|S|Btr002
me070|oh i i i yeah i wouldn't|D|Btr002
fe069|which means it's more stretched out right?|S|Btr002
me070|i wouldn't use that unless i was trying to get to a whole different part of the|D|Btr002
fe066|right right right right.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah i usually have it set to where it has um point five second intervals on the numbers.|S|Btr002
fe068|right that's when i use it too.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|oh that's interesting!|S|Btr002
fe008|i haven't paid attention to the numbers.|S|Btr002
fe008|i sort of like visually|D|Btr002
fe008|it helps me to have it be separated enough that i could find a new breaking point if i needed it.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|yeah that's the reason i separate it out.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah i|D|Btr002
me070|right.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|i do too.|S|Btr002
fe069|but sometimes if it gets too too for me too stretched out um i'll tend to think that there's a break in between a pause inside of a word or something.|S|Btr002
fe008|expanded?|Q|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|oh yes.|S|Btr002
fe069|i don't know.|S|Btr002
fe066|because the uh the waveform becomes too stretched out.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe066|because|D|Btr002
fe069|so i prefer it to be a little bit tighter.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|it's nice to have|D|Btr002
fe069|but i'll stretch i'll stretch it in a particular place if i need to or something.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|S|Btr002
fe066|a sort of like happy medium so you can make sure that the waveform has its like shape.|S|Btr002
me070|uh right.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|D|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|now i know what you're talking about.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|that's kind of interesting though.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|well we're coming kind of close to the end of our time here.|S|Btr002
fe008|um i did ask about dessert.|S|Btr002
fe008|and they told me it was ice cream.|S|Btr002
fe008|and it doesn't save well.|S|Btr002
fe008|so i mean|D|Btr002
me070|oh.|B|Btr002
fe069|well if there's any left we can grab it.|S|Btr002
fe068|if there was pie again|D|Btr002
fe008|that's right.|S|Btr002
fe068|if there was those tarts again i'd be like set us aside some there.|S|Btr002
fe069|ooh those were good.|S|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|but|F|Btr002
fe008|yeah there's some those are those are nice.|S|Btr002
fe068|i'm not a big ice cream fan.|S|Btr002
fe066|really?|Q|Btr002
fe066|oh.|S|Btr002
fe068|nah.|S|Btr002
me070|no?|Q|Btr002
fe008|but i did i was thinking you know it is interesting to me to think about how each each of us have sampled different meetings.|S|Btr002
fe008|and yet it's intriguing to me to think that if i were to describe someone's characteristics in terms of their speech patterns i bet you we would all agree on who it who it was.|S|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|S|Btr002
fe008|you know.|D|Btr002
fe008|i think that's so interesting.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah it's it's a statement of speaker style of course.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|but|F|Btr002
fe069|and also that we can i don't know that we have this shared realm of knowledge kind of.|S|Btr002
fe069|and can laugh about things that other people would not understand whatsoever.|S|Btr002
fe069|or|D|Btr002
fe069|you know?|Q|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|S|Btr002
fe066|the little intricacies and idiosyncracies of people's voices.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah yeah i mean it's really cool.|S|Btr002
fe066|and|F|Btr002
fe069|yeah or even just about what we were talking about with the technical part you know the interface.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|right.|S|Btr002
fe069|i don't know.|S|Btr002
fe008|do you have any favorite parts of these meetings?|Q|Btr002
fe008|things that you|D|Btr002
fe008|i mean we we talked briefly about this last time.|S|Btr002
fe068|when people get really loopy.|S|Btr002
fe068|and start telling lots of jokes i think.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|i enjoy always transcribing those sections.|S|Btr002
fe008|is this do you think this is usually toward the end of the meeting?|Q|Btr002
fe008|or does it vary?|Q|Btr002
fe008|because it could.|S|Btr002
fe068|it's yeah it seems to be more at the end.|S|Btr002
fe008|the the person.|S|Btr002
fe066|eah depends on the person.|S|Btr002
fe067|or in the beginning.|S|Btr002

fe068|like those groups?|Q|Btr002
fe008|it whichever.|S|Btr002
fe008|that way.|S|Btr002
fe008|or or a nature of a meeting.|S|Btr002
fe068|oh.|S|Btr002
fe008|or|D|Btr002
fe069|i prefer ones that are somewhat linguistically related.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
fe069|because it's more interesting for me.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah i like those.|S|Btr002
fe066|i don't like the technical ones.|S|Btr002
fe066|because i don't understand what they're talking about.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|exactly and it's really hard|D|Btr002
fe066|and so i'm just|D|Btr002
fe066|yeah and i'm sitting there bored.|S|Btr002
fe066|because i i really have no concept of what they're talking about.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|so i'm going okay.|S|Btr002

fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|yeah the ones that where they're talking about linguistic things though are great.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|i|D|Btr002
me070|i love those.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|i like those.|D|Btr002
fe008|those are e. would these be the e.d.u. meetings?|Q|Btr002

fe066|the ones with liz and you.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|S|Btr002

fe069|i don't know.|S|Btr002
fe069|discourse stuff.|S|Btr002
fe069|i think it's really fun too to listen to when you give reports on transcription.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh really?|Q|Btr002
fe008|oh i'm really?|Q|Btr002
fe069|yeah because there are always people like you know talking bad about the transcribers.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh i'm glad.|S|Btr002
fe069|and just making fun of|D|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|and so it's really funny.|S|Btr002
fe069|i don't know.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|i that's why i like johno.|S|Btr002
fe069|it's really funny to listen to.|S|Btr002
fe068|i've never heard anyone make fun of transcribers.|S|Btr002
fe069|you haven't?|Q|Btr002
fe066|really?|Q|Btr002
fe066|oh it's so funny.|S|Btr002
fe068|no!|S|Btr002
fe008|oh johno does a lot of that.|S|Btr002
fe068|when you guys were saying that last week i was like never heard that.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|that's why i like listening to him.|S|Btr002
fe069|it's really funny.|S|Btr002
fe066|he's always making fun of transcribers.|S|Btr002
fe008|it would be a kick yeah in a uh in a good natured way.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah yeah yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|it would be really fun to have a collage of all these things like well the transcribers|D|Btr002
fe008|so rer-rer-rer-rer.|S|Btr002
fe008|and then be some horrible thing the transcriber's going to have trouble with this.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah yeah yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|did you hear the meeting where the guy was doing um clicks like from african languages?|Q|Btr002
fe068|yes.|S|Btr002
me070|oh my.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh my god!|S|Btr002
fe008|wasn't that a kick?|Q|Btr002
fe069|no.|S|Btr002
fe068|i did that.|S|Btr002
fe066|no.|S|Btr002
fe008|that was really a kick.|S|Btr002
fe068|and whistles.|S|Btr002
fe068|he was it i you must have been there was a meeting where there was this guy.|S|Btr002
fe068|he was making these funky sounds.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|and making funny whistles.|S|Btr002
fe008|yep.|B|Btr002
fe068|and you must have been sitting next to him.|S|Btr002
fe008|i was exactly.|S|Btr002
fe068|because you sort of engaged him in a conversation about it.|S|Btr002
fe008|exactly so.|S|Btr002
fe068|and he was like yeah i can make dogs uh raise their ears.|S|Btr002
fe008|exactly.|S|Btr002
fe008|exactly!|S|Btr002
fe068|because i can whistle so high.|S|Btr002
fe069|wow.|S|Btr002
fe068|and you were like that's fascinating.|S|Btr002
fe068|i remember that meeting.|S|Btr002
fe068|i thought it was pretty funny.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|i think it's funny when there's little side conversations like that that happen at the same time too.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|i think those are interesting.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|and i think it's really cool when people.|S|Btr002
fe069|start getting really excited about something or angry about something.|S|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|because then they tend to interrupt each other a lot.|S|Btr002
fe069|and|F|Btr002
fe069|i don't know.|S|Btr002
fe069|i mean i remember one where one person um was really trying to get something out really really desperately.|S|Btr002
fe069|and he kept getting interrupted by like three three other people.|S|Btr002
fe069|and he was like|D|Btr002
fe066|oh.|D|Btr002
fe069|and it was i mean it was kind of sad.|S|Btr002
fe069|but it was like also really interesting to watch.|S|Btr002
fe069|or to listen to.|S|Btr002
fe069|both.|S|Btr002
fe008|have have you noticed that sometimes you have these a a greater frequency of speech errors i think during times of of overlap?|Q|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|which which is you can just tell a person's monitoring at two levels.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and it's it's difficult.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|they're like just trying really hard to get it out before they get interrupted or something.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|i don't know.|S|Btr002
fe066|i like transcribing you.|S|Btr002
fe066|because you're very polite.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh thank you!|S|Btr002
fe066|no really.|S|Btr002
fe066|you're always like well i was just thinking about this.|S|Btr002
fe066|and maybe this might be if|D|Btr002
fe066|i uh you know.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|it's just it's just kind of cute.|S|Btr002
fe066|because everybody's like oh well okay.|S|Btr002
fe066|and they'll just listen to you you know.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|they don't interrupt you.|S|Btr002
fe066|they're just like well okay.|S|Btr002
fe066|it's kind of neat.|S|Btr002
fe069|yep.|B|Btr002
fe008|thank you.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|let's see have you one of the things that i found is is um surprisingly difficult these days is to is to get certain electronic sounds to try and describe them?|S|Btr002
fe069|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|have i was thinking about that the other day.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|it was like it's like|D|Btr002
fe008|you know|F|Btr002
fe008|someone in one of these e.d.u. meetings they have a laptop.|S|Btr002
fe008|and they hit the thing.|S|Btr002
fe008|and the and there's an error screen that comes up.|S|Btr002
fe008|and it has this doink kind of sound.|S|Btr002
fe008|and it|D|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|right right.|S|Btr002
fe008|what is that?|Q|Btr002
fe008|it's not a beep.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|it's not a bell.|S|Btr002
fe008|it's not it's not a dong.|S|Btr002
fe008|it's not a|D|Btr002
fe008|i mean you there're all these words that i could imagine.|S|Btr002
fe008|and so it's like it's a tinny kind of electronic sound that comes up when you make an error with your laptop.|S|Btr002
fe008|and that's that's not really very helpful.|S|Btr002
fe067|i wonder if like microsoft has a word for it.|S|Btr002
fe066|now i'm now i'm just wondering how they're going to transcribe you saying that.|S|Btr002
fe069|yes.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh you mean the voice quality?|S|Btr002
fe008|the the shift in|D|Btr002
fe066|the doink.|S|Btr002
fe067|bling.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh that thing.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah i know.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh|D|Btr002
me070|now you did it again!|S|Btr002
me070|stop torturing them!|S|Btr002
fe066|no!|S|Btr002
fe067|let's not make things hard on ourselves later.|S|Btr002
fe069|i know.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|D|Btr002
fe008|yeah well and then you know there are these other things that i think are really interesting.|S|Btr002
fe008|like the vocal changes in character.|S|Btr002
fe008|people shifting into a kind of a comic voice.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|or sort of a mock this or mock that.|S|Btr002
fe068|huh.|B|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|you know the sighing.|S|Btr002
fe008|and the oh no.|S|Btr002
fe008|you know it's it's uh there are lot's of nuances which we uh which we use very often.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|comic words and things like that.|S|Btr002
fe069|you know|D|Btr002
fe008|and|D|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|sorry.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|sorry to i just remembered one thing that really was you needed.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|D|Btr002
fe069|i think it was you that pointed out the problem.|S|Btr002
fe069|like you needed to be at the meeting to be able to transcribe correctly the noise.|S|Btr002
fe069|i think it was adam was making this really strange noise.|S|Btr002
fe069|and apparently he was pretending|D|Btr002
fe008|eech-eech or something.|S|Btr002
fe069|he was like pretending to screw something into his head.|S|Btr002
fe008|whee-whee.|S|Btr002
fe067|what?|D|Btr002
fe069|was that what it was?|Q|Btr002
fe008|yes it was one of these it was this kind of deal.|D|Btr002
me070|oh yeah i had that one.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|oh yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|yes oh yes.|S|Btr002
fe008|and he got to transcribe this meeting.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|and there was all this meta stuff about|D|Btr002
me070|that was fun.|S|Btr002
fe008|because i was giving a report on what the comments were.|S|Btr002
fe008|and it was one of these was this.|S|Btr002
fe008|so|F|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|whee-whee is what he said.|S|Btr002
fe008|and he was going like this at the time.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|joel's like i am not amused.|S|Btr002
me070|i don't even want to like try to repeat what he said.|S|Btr002
me070|because i don't want to put the transcriber through it again.|S|Btr002
fe008|yes that's right.|S|Btr002
fe008|let's just|D|Btr002
me070|but they actually had a big list of like things that people had transcribed.|S|Btr002
me070|and then they were reading one them one by one.|S|Btr002
me070|and being like what's this.|S|Btr002
me070|this.|S|Btr002
me070|you know and then doing the sounds.|S|Btr002
fe066|aw.|S|Btr002
me070|and then this sound must be this sound.|S|Btr002
fe069|oh.|B|Btr002
fe069|oh wow.|S|Btr002
me070|this sound must be this.|S|Btr002
fe069|i had one like that where they were describing the different qualities of uhhuh and uh and uah.|S|Btr002
fe069|and like what e.h. is versus u.h. versus a.h.|S|Btr002
me070|i had yeah i had one like that too.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|oh man.|S|Btr002
fe069|that was really hard.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|that's really interesting.|S|Btr002
me070|i had|D|Btr002
me070|yeah.|F|Btr002
me070|i had one where they were just they were just like talking about each word you know.|S|Btr002
me070|and they were saying they were just describing the word over and over again.|S|Btr002
me070|and just the the quotes around the word were driving me crazy when they knowing.|S|Btr002
me070|when to put the quotes and when|D|Btr002
me070|and then they were talking about like the difference between uh when it's a or when it's uh.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|and at some point they were saying it so much i didn't know how to transcribe it anymore.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|i was like i don't know if you're saying a or uh anymore.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe068|oh yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|you did an excellent job.|S|Btr002
fe008|that was really it was like transcription a meta-transcription and meta meta meta.|S|Btr002
me070|oh thank you.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|yeah cool.|S|Btr002
fe008|it's really.|D|Btr002
me070|it was fun.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|you know i'm really interested in this topic.|S|Btr002
fe008|would it be a problem if we continued a little bit longer on this?|Q|Btr002
fe008|or do you need to do people need to leave?|Q|Btr002
fe008|i don't want to keep you longer than|D|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|i'm fine.|S|Btr002
fe067|i can stay.|S|Btr002
fe069|i don't have to be anywhere until five.|S|Btr002
fe068|sure.|S|Btr002
fe008|are we okay?|Q|Btr002
fe069|so|F|Btr002
fe008|oh okay we won't be that long i don't think.|S|Btr002
fe068|no.|S|Btr002
fe069|good.|S|Btr002
fe068|sure.|D|Btr002
fe008|but but i really appreciate it.|S|Btr002
me070|okay.|D|Btr002
fe008|this is just really it's so interesting to me the the specific experiences of of having encountered these data in this way.|S|Btr002
fe008|does um did anybody else want to say anything about|D|Btr002
fe068|i mean just weird things like before|D|Btr002
fe068|like i had kind of a weird thing happen.|S|Btr002
fe068|and we'd talked about it.|S|Btr002
fe068|it was when i'd first started working on the project i got this discussion where|D|Btr002
fe068|this was before we had the different channels.|S|Btr002
fe068|and um dan ellis it was when dan ellis was still here.|S|Btr002
fe008|yes.|B|Btr002
fe068|so it was like kind of early on right?|S|Btr002
fe068|and um|F|Btr002
fe068|he everyone's talking.|S|Btr002
fe068|and then all of the sudden you hear dan talking to someone else.|S|Btr002
fe068|and it's different people that you'd never heard before.|S|Btr002
fe068|and and what he had done is he had left the room to|D|Btr002
fe068|he'd and he had brought the microphone with him.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh no!|S|Btr002
fe068|and this is without the channelized interface.|S|Btr002
fe068|so you you have no idea.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh my gosh.|S|Btr002
fe069|oh man.|S|Btr002
me070|oh wow.|S|Btr002
fe068|you think everyone's just become schizophrenic or something.|S|Btr002
fe069|oh|D|Btr002
fe068|and they're all like in they're own world or something.|S|Btr002
fe068|because then all of the sudden he's talking about a he needs a copy machine.|S|Btr002
fe068|and i and i'm just assuming well he's still in the room.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh|D|Btr002
fe068|and what the heck's he talking about.|S|Btr002
me070|wow.|S|Btr002
fe068|but just sort of just weird things like that.|S|Btr002
fe068|and um yeah he had just left the room.|S|Btr002
fe068|and gone and made a copy.|S|Btr002
fe068|and he still had his microphone on.|S|Btr002
fe068|and then you could hear the the the the women behind the desk talking to him.|S|Btr002
fe068|and just sort of stuff like that.|S|Btr002
fe068|it was just really bizarre.|S|Btr002
fe068|so|F|Btr002
fe069|that's really funny.|S|Btr002
fe068|anyway just sort of weird things like that.|S|Btr002
fe008|well it is there's another case where i ran across like of that type.|S|Btr002
fe008|um when i was sitting here and we were doing|D|Btr002
fe008|this was like one of the first meetings i ever participated in.|S|Btr002
fe008|and and dan was adjusting something here.|S|Btr002
fe008|and adam was in the next room.|S|Btr002
fe008|and um adam says so i'll come in here and check the levels.|S|Btr002
fe008|and and he says something.|S|Btr002
fe008|and dan says no.|S|Btr002
fe008|and it sounds like he's saying no to adam.|S|Btr002
fe008|and it was if if if so this would have been extremely rude.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|but the thing and and the reason that it would be rude is because you don't have this information from hearing all these equalized volume channels.|S|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|you don't know that they're not participating in the same conversation at all.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|it really is strange.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|it lead us it if we|D|Btr002
fe068|so|F|Btr002
fe008|it is true that this is kind of an artificial.|S|Btr002
fe008|and um|D|Btr002
fe008|discourse aspect.|S|Btr002
fe008|the mixed channel is artificial.|S|Btr002
fe008|because we're boosting it in order to make everything audible.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe067|huh.|F|Btr002
fe066|it's interesting because like um when i'm working late at night i actually don't feel so lonely.|S|Btr002
fe008|but|F|Btr002
fe066|because there's so many voices in my head.|S|Btr002
fe008|you mean when you leave here?|Q|Btr002
fe008|when you're somewhere else.|S|Btr002
fe066|no no while i while i'm working here.|S|Btr002
fe008|no no okay.|S|Btr002
fe066|it's like nine o'clock.|S|Btr002
fe066|and nobody's here except for me.|S|Btr002
fe066|and i'm like you know i don't feel so lonely.|S|Btr002
fe069|oh yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|because there are like eight people talking to me all at once.|S|Btr002
fe066|i'm like wow.|S|Btr002
fe008|how about these meetings when where there are like eight speakers in one meeting?|Q|Btr002
fe008|are those what are those like?|Q|Btr002
fe066|takes a long time.|S|Btr002
fe008|are|D|Btr002
fe068|they take longer to do.|S|Btr002
fe069|it takes a long time yeah.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe068|in a way they're more fun though.|S|Btr002
fe066|takes a long time.|D|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe068|there's just more variety.|S|Btr002
fe069|i tends i you know what i noticed is it tends to have a still a dominant group of speakers.|S|Btr002
fe066|sometimes.|S|Btr002
fe069|and then there are two or three people generally who don't talk at all.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|who won't talk.|S|Btr002
fe069|except to say their digits or something.|S|Btr002
fe069|or who|D|Btr002
fe068|and to breathe.|S|Btr002
fe067|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|or to breathe and cough and sniff and whatever.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|S|Btr002
fe067|oh god.|S|Btr002
fe068|there'll be lots of breathing yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah but i i think that still overall you're going to have probably three or four or five dominant speakers.|S|Btr002
fe066|one thing i noticed is that like|D|Btr002
fe066|uhhh there was this one meeting i was transcribing there were nine nine speakers.|S|Btr002
fe066|and by the end of it i was so entirely sick of listening to the same conversation all over again.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|nine times in slow mo.|S|Btr002
fe069|exactly.|S|Btr002
me070|definitely.|S|Btr002
fe066|i was going nuts.|S|Btr002
fe066|i was like i cannot take this anymore.|S|Btr002
fe066|i can't listen to this anymore.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh my god.|S|Btr002
fe008|i had that same reaction.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|absolutely and sometimes these are meetings i participated in.|S|Btr002
fe008|it's like|D|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|so you've this is like the tenth time for you then.|S|Btr002
fe066|i swear it's like it's like a bad dream.|S|Btr002
fe008|that's that's right.|S|Btr002
fe066|it's like this is this is keep this keeps happening to me.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|never changes.|S|Btr002
fe008|i'm going to check outside to make sure that we're okay with the um|D|Btr002
fe069|oh okay.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh okay.|S|Btr002
fe068|did you guys ever|D|Btr002
fe068|when this happened to me when i first started transcribing.|S|Btr002
fe068|because i had never really transcribed stuff like this before.|S|Btr002
fe008|is it okay if we stay for another half hour in this room?|Q|Btr002
fe068|but um|F|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|good thanks.|S|Btr002
fe068|i would leave here.|S|Btr002
fe068|and i would go out and do my daily business.|S|Btr002
fe068|and i would hear people speaking to me.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|and i would transcribe them in my head.|S|Btr002
fe066|yes yeah yeah yeah oh yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|oh man.|S|Btr002
me070|oh yeah that's fun.|S|Btr002
fe068|i'd imagine what i would type.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah yeah.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe068|it went away like maybe after a couple of weeks.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|oh really?|Q|Btr002
fe068|but it was just bizarre.|S|Btr002
fe066|i still do that i still do that.|S|Btr002
me070|i still do that.|S|Btr002
fe067|no i|D|Btr002
fe067|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|really?|Q|Btr002
fe069|occasionally.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|like on the bus or something when i'm bored.|S|Btr002
fe066|yep or like i'll think|D|Btr002
fe067|right it's something you're not interacting with.|S|Btr002
fe068|oh no for me it was unconscious.|S|Btr002
fe067|you're just listening.|S|Btr002
fe069|oh really?|Q|Btr002
fe068|it was i didn't mean for to be doing it.|S|Btr002
fe069|oh okay.|S|Btr002
fe066|no yeah yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|oh oh.|S|Btr002
fe068|it would just it was an intrusion.|S|Btr002
fe067|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|oh that's funny.|S|Btr002
fe068|um not a not a bad intrusion.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe068|but|F|Btr002
fe068|not something i was sort of volitionally sort of|D|Btr002
fe069|huh that's interesting.|S|Btr002
fe066|i would also be really aware of how i was speaking.|S|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe068|yes!|S|Btr002
fe066|because i also tend|D|Btr002
fe066|like we were talking about so.|S|Btr002
fe066|i do that.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|i'll end utterances with so or and.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|and it'll just be a trailing off and i'll think man i would be such a pain in the butt to transcribe.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah!|B|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe068|yeah!|S|Btr002
fe066|like i just uh i|D|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|F|Btr002
fe066|i'll i'll do the same thing as you do.|S|Btr002
fe066|and i i'll listen to somebody and his or her speech will be particularly idiosyncratic.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|and i'll go wow i just i'm glad i'm not transcribing him or her.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah i noticed a lot of my speech i don't know i wouldn't call them errors i guess disfluencies a lot more once when i started transcribing.|S|Btr002
fe069|i just noticed and in people in general that people break up their speech interestingly.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|i'm amazed sometimes that we manage to communicate.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|actually.|S|Btr002
fe066|you know because people will say just like you know monosyllabic little grunts and squeaks and things.|S|Btr002
fe069|i think that shows a lot of i think that shows a lot of how um it's not all acoustic.|S|Btr002
fe066|and it means something.|S|Btr002
fe069|i mean there's other things involved.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe069|eye contact.|S|Btr002
fe069|body language.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe069|gesture.|S|Btr002
fe069|whatever.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|that raises a question.|S|Btr002
fe008|um do you think that um you would have been considerably helped if we had had video tapes of these things?|Q|Btr002
fe068|oh sure.|S|Btr002
fe066|yes.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
fe069|i definitely think so.|S|Btr002
fe066|yep mhh.|D|Btr002
fe069|and i think there would be a lot more interesting data to analyze later on personally.|S|Btr002
fe008|huh well uhhuh uhhuh that's right.|S|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|because you're involved in gesture research.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|yeah because then you know exactly what's going on.|S|Btr002
fe066|what the context cues are|D|Btr002
fe069|and you can really get a feel for the interpersonal relationships.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|which kind of comes into play maybe not for speech recognition.|S|Btr002
fe069|but for other things maybe.|S|Btr002
fe066|maybe this is what it's like to be blind.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|oh interesting.|S|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|maybe.|S|Btr002
fe068|huh.|S|Btr002
fe008|huh.|B|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|no no visual input at all.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah you just have to rely on your intonation.|S|Btr002
fe069|and other things like that.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|S|Btr002
fe066|and you get so much more aware of all of it too.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah uhhuh maybe.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|that's|D|Btr002
fe008|i know someone who actually recognizes perfumes in the elevator.|S|Btr002
fe008|i mean there's a there's a blind man in this in this building.|S|Btr002
fe069|oh.|B|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and and um lila was in the elevator one day.|S|Btr002
fe008|and they hadn't spoken yet.|S|Btr002
fe008|because he just came on the elevator.|S|Btr002
fe008|and he says|D|Btr002
fe008|uh and then she then she said something.|S|Btr002
fe008|and he says you you've changed your perfume.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh wow.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah it's pretty interesting pretty interesting.|S|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|that's pretty amazing.|S|Btr002
fe068|had she changed her perfume?|Q|Btr002
fe066|that's neat.|S|Btr002
fe008|yes she had.|S|Btr002
fe068|oh wow.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|oof!|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|it's very interesting.|S|Btr002
fe069|enhanced other senses i guess.|S|Btr002
fe069|that's really cool.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe069|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|have you|D|Btr002
fe008|i i've learned several things about having been with the close talking mikes.|S|Btr002
fe008|this is this is a new experience.|S|Btr002
fe008|because i have of course been involved in in this kind of thing for quite a while.|S|Btr002
fe008|but there are several things i didn't realize you could hear so reliably.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and some of these are the things like when the mouth opens.|S|Btr002
fe008|and the inbreath and stuff.|S|Btr002
fe008|and it and how extremely audible and and visual.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe067|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|i mean you can see these the inbreaths and things.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|it's that was really surprising to me that you it's that tangible.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|that's something you don't hear in normal speech too.|S|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|in normal conversations unless it's very dramatic or very loud|D|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|that people click their their lips are always making funny noises.|S|Btr002
fe067|unless you're on uh talking on the phone.|S|Btr002
fe069|and|D|Btr002
fe067|and the phone is the levels are funny.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe067|then you hear it.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe067|so it's kind of like that.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|i guess it's also one of these things that usually is not meaningful.|S|Btr002
fe008|so we sort of screen it out.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|all these different|D|Btr002
fe008|because you know i mean we do that all the time with all other well lots of other aspects of the acoustic signal.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|it sounds like it's a nice smooth melody.|S|Btr002
fe008|but these things are voicing and unvoicing are tripping in and out.|S|Btr002
fe008|and they don't the contour is really not nearly that neat.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|right yeah well yeah most of the time when we're listening to other people's speech we're just trying to get the gist.|S|Btr002
fe068|not literally what people are saying.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe068|and so|F|Btr002
fe068|you know all the uh uh's and um's and all those different things|D|Btr002
fe066|that's true.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah we filter all that out.|S|Btr002
fe068|we just tune it out.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe068|and uh it's that top down thing again.|S|Btr002
fe068|just|D|Btr002
fe068|right?|Q|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh yeah yeah absolutely absolutely.|S|Btr002
fe068|in a way.|S|Btr002
fe068|just trying to get the um|D|Btr002
fe068|you know what is the what is the point of what this person is trying to communicate kind of thing.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|that's right.|S|Btr002
fe068|so|F|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|which is a very it's that's how i tended before studying linguistics anyways and uh definitely before doing transcription how i tended to look all conversations|D|Btr002
fe008|that's right.|S|Btr002
fe069|and then coming here and doing this you have to look at speech in a totally more intense way.|S|Btr002
fe069|um|F|Btr002
fe069|including i mean every little aspect.|S|Btr002
fe069|i and when i tell people what i do here|D|Btr002
fe069|and tell them yeah i'm transcribing.|S|Btr002
fe069|and they're they think i'm like a stenographer or something.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|i'm like no i don't correct the grammar.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|i don't erase the um s and uh s.|S|Btr002
fe069|i record all the sighs and the laughs and the breaths.|S|Btr002
fe069|and and they're|D|Btr002
fe069|i don't know.|S|Btr002
fe069|this is a very different thing than most people can relate to i guess.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh the i agree.|S|Btr002
fe069|or know about.|S|Btr002
fe008|another thing that i think is interesting in these meetings is certain speakers have a tendency to embed utterances in other uh in other utterances.|S|Btr002
fe008|and um you know it's very clear when you see it when you hear it with the intonational markers.|S|Btr002
fe008|but well just the contours.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|but the words on the page it's not at all clear.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|and there are a couple people who do this in particular.|S|Btr002
fe067|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|i i would say that it's both i would say that both jerry and morgan do this.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and it's amazing how fluent it is when you hear it.|S|Btr002
fe008|but how very complicated it is when you see the words.|S|Btr002
fe066|indecipherable.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|D|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|and when you think about it they pick up exactly where they left off.|S|Btr002
fe069|even though maybe it's several seconds later there's no glitch in the syntax or anything.|S|Btr002
fe069|it's we're pretty amazing machines.|S|Btr002
fe069|or creatures.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|whatever.|S|Btr002
fe008|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|that's really cool.|S|Btr002
fe066|machines.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|D|Btr002
fe008|so and then of course there are these these things which i think are also nicely represented in the data.|S|Btr002
fe008|which are these funny sounds people make.|S|Btr002
fe008|which to some degree is borrowing from comic talk.|S|Btr002
fe008|so i notice people going pfft you know if they're trying to say something is done.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|the germans do this i think in particular.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and there are others that we use like that|D|Btr002
fe008|which are sort of semi-conventionalized.|S|Btr002
fe008|but you wouldn't think that you would write them down.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah the one i i get all the time is tsk.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|oh yes good example!|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|it's it's uh like i don't know how i just transcribe it as i say like click.|S|Btr002
fe069|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|it's like|D|Btr002
fe069|tisk.|S|Btr002
fe066|and then i say it's like a vocal gesture.|S|Btr002
fe066|like a shrug or a vocal some some sort of like well there it is.|S|Btr002
fe008|yes.|B|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|or that's it.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|or something like that you know.|S|Btr002
fe066|that people do that one a lot.|S|Btr002
fe066|and there was one speaker who used to do it constantly.|S|Btr002
fe066|and after a while i started getting confused as to whether or not he was like just going tsk tsk tsk tsk tsk to himself.|S|Btr002
fe066|or whether he was meaning it in|D|Btr002
fe066|sometimes it was really obvious that he meant it as some sort of vocal cue.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|but then sometimes it was more ambiguous.|S|Btr002
fe066|like it was tough to tell.|S|Btr002
fe066|um because he would just always be clicking.|S|Btr002
fe008|this is this the one that|D|Btr002
fe008|i mean it could be the one that we were thinking about.|S|Btr002
fe069|it could be.|S|Btr002
fe069|but i noticed it more as it was obviously not|D|Btr002
fe069|because it was always in a the one i'm thinking of always came in groups of four or something.|S|Btr002
fe008|yes uhhuh.|S|Btr002
fe069|and so it wasn't ever like a um single|D|Btr002
fe066|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|oh okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|it would be it would|D|Btr002
fe066|yeah this guy does a lot of single ones.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh how interesting.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah just kind of um|D|Btr002
fe066|and uh that's another thing like i i realize i do that too.|S|Btr002
fe008|i'll ask you who this is later.|S|Btr002
fe008|i don't want to because|D|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|i can't remember the name actually.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|the the one that i'm thinking of.|S|Btr002
fe008|it's a matter of you can tell it's in context where he's looking in his agenda to see you know do i have time to do this.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and he's calculating it in his mind.|S|Btr002
fe008|so it's sort of almost like a stand in for calculator kind of thing.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and uh but it's signaling.|S|Btr002
fe008|i'm sure that everybody i'm sure that other people can hear it.|S|Btr002
fe008|so it's sort of like wait a minute i'm thinking.|S|Btr002
fe069|right yeah yeah yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|but it's not lexicalized.|S|Btr002
fe008|this is not a|D|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|that's kind of the impression i got too.|S|Btr002
fe008|not in a standard way.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh yeah that's a different person.|S|Btr002
fe008|it's|D|Btr002
fe008|okay okay okay.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah okay i know who you're talking about.|S|Btr002
fe066|but this is somebody somebody|D|Btr002
fe008|he must do this in a lot of meetings.|S|Btr002
fe008|because i think you know i've run across it several times.|S|Btr002
me070|i don't think i've ever heard it.|S|Btr002
fe069|no.|S|Btr002
fe068|no.|S|Btr002
fe069|huh.|B|Btr002
fe068|i've heard.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|D|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|which i just transcribe as mouth.|S|Btr002
fe008|heard that one.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh i see.|S|Btr002
fe068|i just make a mouth.|S|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe068|because i think i had talked to you about this about|D|Btr002
fe068|what what did we do because what was it that i|D|Btr002
fe068|oh i was|D|Btr002
fe068|lipsmack.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh yes.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe068|i was marking lipsmack.|S|Btr002
fe068|and and you said|D|Btr002
fe069|that's more like the.|D|Btr002
fe068|yeah that's it's a different noise.|S|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe068|but um|F|Btr002
fe068|it's what made me think of it.|S|Btr002
fe067|uh.|S|Btr002
fe068|but um|F|Btr002
fe066|the one you're talking|D|Btr002
fe068|and and you said don't do lipsmack.|S|Btr002
fe068|just do we don't need it's too specific.|S|Btr002
fe068|just do mouth for all all those noises.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah okay now what i would say um|D|Btr002
fe068|um|F|Btr002
fe008|it's good to know this.|S|Btr002
fe008|what i what i would say is um if it's communicative beyond just the mouth opening and the oh you know the mechanical aspects that happen when you happen to be about to speak then i would like to have it if it's communicative i'd like to have it preserved.|S|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe067|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|right.|S|Btr002
fe008|but if it's just this mechanical stuff mouth is fine.|S|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|the it seems like the computer science people use lipsmack for that.|S|Btr002
fe008|i personally my choice|D|Btr002
fe008|uh we've we're still deciding on how we're going to encode it in the final version.|S|Btr002
fe008|but i tend to not like lipsmack.|S|Btr002
fe008|because i think that that's could be meaningful.|S|Btr002
fe008|and it's a little confusing.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|S|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|people talk about you know oh gee that was really good.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and then they do a|D|Btr002
fe008|i'm not going to do it.|S|Btr002
fe008|because i don't really know how to do lipsmack.|S|Btr002
fe008|but but it seems like it would be a a vocal gesture.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|it could be.|S|Btr002
fe008|a definite type of thing.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|right yeah i was thinking the one that you just did like tsk makes me think of the what people would write as tsk tsk.|S|Btr002
fe008|yes.|B|Btr002
fe008|same here yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah me too.|S|Btr002
fe066|you know like uh as though they're like you know trying to communicate displeasure.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|i would too.|S|Btr002
fe068|oh right.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|that's true yeah.|S|Btr002
fe068|right.|F|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|and so that|D|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|there's there's at least two or three that i can think of that to me are very different.|S|Btr002
fe066|you know there's like you know that.|S|Btr002
fe068|right.|B|Btr002
fe066|and there's like um you know well the one i did before that's like.|S|Btr002
fe066|i don't know like um hhh.|S|Btr002
fe008|i would say tongue click for that.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|but i would also probably put in parentheses it that i thought it was a vocal gesture.|S|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|because i think it's communicative of a certain thing.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|i don't know what i am never sure whether or not to transcribe um a difference with like huh you know and huh !.|S|Btr002
fe069|oh yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh good point yes.|S|Btr002
me070|like how do you transcribe huh !?|Q|Btr002
fe069|it's like humph|D|Btr002
fe066|i'll put like a|D|Btr002
fe008|really good point.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|i'll usually put a an exclamation point somehow.|S|Btr002
fe066|like i'll go|D|Btr002
fe008|i would too.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah?|Q|Btr002
fe069|oh.|S|Btr002
fe008|i think it's more emphatic.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|what about transcribing it um h.m.p. h?|Q|Btr002
fe008|but it it's true that segments are different too.|S|Btr002
me070|what about transcribing it that way?|Q|Btr002
fe066|hmph.|B|Btr002
me070|like hmph.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh!|B|Btr002
fe068|oh.|B|Btr002
fe008|well now this is a good question.|S|Btr002
fe008|i guess i would say you know sometimes we've seen hmph in literature meaning|D|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|but it's a a sigh a uh sorry a sound of indignation.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|so if it's meant as a sound of indignation then i think that would be how i would capture it with the h.m.p.h. thing.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|i usually tend to think that it's a more of a|D|Btr002
fe069|hhh not indignation.|S|Btr002
fe069|something more positive.|S|Btr002
fe069|i don't know exactly how to characterize it.|S|Btr002
fe067|like|D|Btr002
fe069|but something more|D|Btr002
fe066|oh really?|Q|Btr002
fe067|huh.|S|Btr002
fe008|sort of like a uh an uh an elevated huh?|Q|Btr002
fe067|i hadn't thought of that.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe067|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|it's like a sort of more surprise or engagement.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|or|D|Btr002
fe067|hhh.|B|Btr002
fe069|i i don't know.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah i guess it could have two meanings sort of.|S|Btr002
fe069|maybe.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe068|if it's surprise then the exclamation point makes sense too.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|S|Btr002
fe008|and then there's the other kind which sounds similar.|S|Btr002
fe008|but it's really part of a laugh.|S|Btr002
fe008|so uhhuh uhhuh huh.|S|Btr002
fe068|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|which is i would just say laugh for that.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|laugh right.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe068|yeah once adam was laughing.|S|Btr002
fe068|and it was actually written out phonetically.|S|Btr002
fe068|and i changed it.|S|Btr002
fe068|i'm like it's just laughing.|S|Btr002
fe008|good.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|well done well done.|S|Btr002
fe068|like somebody had written like hyuh-hyuh or or or something.|S|Btr002
fe068|and|F|Btr002
fe008|i've run across that also.|S|Btr002
fe008|and|D|Btr002
fe008|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|change it to laugh.|S|Btr002
me070|that's funny.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah i it was maybe tigerfish had done something.|S|Btr002
fe008|well done.|S|Btr002
fe068|like they had written out a phonetic laugh.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|and they didn't do it at any other place in the transcript.|S|Btr002
fe066|that's interesting.|S|Btr002
fe069|that's interesting.|S|Btr002
fe008|i ran across a couple ho s|D|Btr002
fe068|it was just that one spot.|S|Btr002
fe008|i've seen ho s.|S|Btr002
fe068|it was just a regular old vanilla laugh you know.|S|Btr002
me070|ho ho ho?|Q|Btr002
fe008|and|D|Btr002
me070|oh that is too much fun.|S|Btr002
fe008|and heh.|S|Btr002
fe068|it wasn't anything special.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|yeah that's right.|S|Btr002
fe069|i noticed as far as problems with laughs is that a lot of them were marked as breaths.|S|Btr002
fe008|we|D|Btr002
fe069|because a lot of people|D|Btr002
fe008|yes.|S|Btr002
fe069|i think we already talked about this last time.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe067|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|but|D|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|but not so much as i never saw that written out phonetically or whatever.|S|Btr002
fe008|well|D|Btr002
fe068|well|D|Btr002
fe068|well here's a question.|S|Btr002
fe068|and there's been some variance in transcripts that i've looked at.|S|Btr002
fe068|when|D|Btr002
fe068|okay.|F|Btr002
fe068|so when you laugh you're exhaling all this air.|S|Btr002
fe008|yes.|B|Btr002
fe068|and so you need to inhale.|S|Btr002
fe008|yes.|B|Btr002
fe068|and so how do you transcribe the inhale?|Q|Btr002
fe068|some people are transcribing it as a breath.|S|Btr002
fe068|i used to you know back in the day back when i was transcribing i would do the whole thing as a laugh.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah yeah yeah yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah that's what i used to do too.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh yeah yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|because to me the breath is part of the laugh.|S|Btr002
fe008|i agree with you.|S|Btr002
me070|oh yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|that's that's what i prefer.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe068|um so because because in the ones i've been the one i've been checking actually right now that breath gets marked as a breath.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|and i've been taking them out.|S|Btr002
fe069|so you would have like laugh breath laugh?|Q|Btr002
fe008|good well done.|S|Btr002
fe068|so that's okay?|Q|Btr002
fe008|well done.|S|Btr002
fe068|actually it'd be a laugh.|S|Btr002
fe069|transcribed?|D|Btr002
fe068|and then two dots.|S|Btr002
fe068|like the next bin will be empty.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe068|and then it'll be breath.|S|Btr002
fe069|oh i've|D|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe068|and so it'll be that|D|Btr002
fe066|yeah i was going to say i put|D|Btr002
fe069|okay.|S|Btr002
me070|oh.|S|Btr002
fe069|i see what you're saying.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|it'll be three sort of separate units as opposed to i think it's sort of one coherent thing.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe068|so|F|Btr002
fe066|i put breath laugh in the brackets when i don't know whether it's a breath or a laugh.|S|Btr002
fe008|that's good that's good.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|which is what i remember you telling me to do that.|S|Btr002
fe068|oh well yeah that's that's a different thing.|S|Btr002
fe008|that's right.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe067|huh okay.|B|Btr002
fe068|yeah because sometimes it's not clear.|S|Btr002
fe008|that's good.|S|Btr002
fe069|sometimes it's hard to tell.|S|Btr002
fe068|like sometimes hhh is a laugh.|S|Btr002
fe067|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|right.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|that's right.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe068|um and if other people are laughing then i'll usually give them and say that they're laughing.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and|D|Btr002
fe008|i agree with you.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|and and i think that's important.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|because we're capturing then the communicative level.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah exactly.|S|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh exactly.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|and it's likely that it has a different contour than most breaths as well.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|D|Btr002
fe008|because it's sort of expulsive and and uh that kind of thing.|S|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|exactly exactly.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|a lot of people go.|S|Btr002
fe008|well done.|S|Btr002
fe068|so|F|Btr002
fe008|yes they do.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah the shyer ones sometimes will laugh with the breath laugh.|S|Btr002
fe008|and you can see it.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|S|Btr002
fe008|you can see the little little peaks which is interesting.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe068|right.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|but yes yeah exactly.|S|Btr002
fe008|i wouldn't uh that's a case you know i know generally with the tigerfish things that they put breath and we leave it in.|S|Btr002
fe008|but absolutely there yeah.|S|Btr002
fe068|good okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|laugh change it.|S|Btr002
fe008|and you know there are other places where it's in the way you know|D|Btr002
fe008|i i mainly said not to change their breath s simply because it would take time to move them if|D|Btr002
fe008|and if they're not in the way then don't don't mess with it.|S|Btr002
me070|a lot of times though the breaths are um results of bad segmentation.|S|Btr002
fe008|but|D|Btr002
me070|and there's a segmentation of nothing.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh yes!|B|Btr002
me070|and so they just write it as a breath when it's clearly not a breath.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah i've taken out some of those.|S|Btr002
me070|and i usually always take those out.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|i mean usually um it seems like the segmenter um often just sort of um segments|D|Btr002
fe008|great.|B|Btr002
me070|when there's really long spaces it segments random spaces in between.|S|Btr002
me070|and you know they get that.|S|Btr002
me070|and there's nothing there.|S|Btr002
me070|so they mark it as a breath when it's really actually nothing.|S|Btr002
me070|so usually i take those out.|S|Btr002
fe008|that's right.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|well they give the segmenter though|D|Btr002
fe068|because they don't have the the rich interface that we do.|S|Btr002
fe068|so they must be giving the pre-segmenter sort of the benefit of the doubt.|S|Btr002
fe068|well there must be something there um whether i can hear it or not.|S|Btr002
me070|right right exactly exactly.|S|Btr002
fe069|oh yeah i'm sure they are.|S|Btr002
fe068|so they just say well it's a breath then.|S|Btr002
me070|exactly.|S|Btr002
fe008|one wonders what it might be|D|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|although they did put a missing segment sometimes in brackets.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|yeah there are some where|D|Btr002
fe068|yes!|S|Btr002
me070|oh really?|Q|Btr002
fe068|that's true.|S|Btr002
me070|oh i always get i always get breath.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|well see i i do a previous filtering before i give the tigerfish ones out.|S|Btr002
fe069|i've gotten both.|S|Btr002
fe008|and and i i have tried to get the that particular the the missing segment removed.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|but i don't always do it.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah i've seen a few of them.|S|Btr002
fe068|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|so yeah you've they slip through.|S|Btr002
fe068|well frequently that'll also be a misattribution too of voice.|S|Btr002
fe069|but i've seen a several breath s too.|S|Btr002
me070|huh!|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah yeah.|S|Btr002
fe068|because then you'll hear you'll hear part of what another person is saying and and that's all transcribed on that one level.|S|Btr002
fe068|but then you'll hear a little bit of it and then missing segment.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|it's like okay well they just it's in the wrong|D|Btr002
fe069|it's just in the wrong place.|S|Btr002
fe068|that person's not talking at all.|S|Btr002
fe068|so you just get rid of it.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe068|so|F|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh.|D|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|D|Btr002
fe008|interesting.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay well let's see.|S|Btr002
fe008|so um do you think that this has changed your speech in other ways?|Q|Btr002
fe008|in terms of|D|Btr002
fe008|myself i do feel that i'm|D|Btr002
fe008|when i spend a lot of hours doing this i become less fluent.|S|Btr002
fe008|i have more false starts and things.|S|Btr002
fe069|really?|Q|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|i don't know if it's it could just be because there're so many more hours i haven't been talking.|S|Btr002
fe068|huh!|B|Btr002
fe066|i guess i try to be more careful in my speech more often.|S|Btr002
fe008|good.|S|Btr002
fe066|unless i'm really not paying any attention.|S|Btr002
fe066|like you know if i'm at a party or something and i'm just sort of having a good time then it doesn't really matter.|S|Btr002
fe066|but in you know normal one-on-one speech i i think i tend to try to enunciate more.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|because i've been told i mumble.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh huh.|S|Btr002
fe066|um and i guess i used to be worse about it.|S|Btr002
fe066|i was told by my parents that i used to mumble a lot.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|uh and also i i have this sort of east coast accent that comes in sometimes that makes it hard for people on the west coast to understand what i'm saying.|S|Btr002
fe008|huh!|B|Btr002
fe066|a lot of times like uh if i'm not paying attention i'll say something that uh will not really be heard.|S|Btr002
fe066|i tend to leave off final consonants for instance.|S|Btr002
fe066|and people uh i have to be conscious of that sometimes.|S|Btr002
fe008|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|yeah so|F|Btr002
fe008|so mainly for clarity it sounds like like in phrasing or strategies.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|huh one thing that i noticed|D|Btr002
fe069|i don't know if it's a really a question of me being more changing my speech necessarily.|S|Btr002
fe069|but i'm much more aware of interruptions in conversation in normal conversation.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh.|S|Btr002
fe068|oh yeah that's true.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh.|B|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|D|Btr002
fe069|so uh maybe i am more careful in the sense that i maybe don't interrupt as much.|S|Btr002
fe069|or i'm more aware of it when i am doing it.|S|Btr002
fe069|or something like that.|S|Btr002
fe069|but um i just pay attention more to the fact that every pretty much all the time in normal conversation there are interruptions.|S|Btr002
fe069|there's no|D|Btr002
fe069|i mean unless you have really|D|Btr002
fe069|i mean i think if there were no interruptions it would sound really awkward.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|there would be a lot of pauses.|S|Btr002
fe069|and that would kind of imply uncomfortability or something.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|but|F|Btr002
fe008|i guess it depends partly on the type of interruption.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|i mean if it's a clarifying type like well do you mean when they're partway through it in a utterance|D|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|it's different.|D|Btr002
fe066|yeah i tend to think of a conversation that has no interruptions as being something that's unnatural and forced.|S|Btr002
fe066|or something like a meeting where you know i mean everybody says their little schpiel.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|and people are meant to be you know pretty pretty quiet and attentive for the most part.|S|Btr002
fe066|and then they let them finish.|S|Btr002
fe066|and then somebody else comes in.|S|Btr002
fe066|and says something about it.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|um|F|Btr002
fe066|and in a like a friendly conversation i i notice that that's not really true.|S|Btr002
fe066|like what you were saying.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe069|but even in cases like that even when it is|D|Btr002
fe069|see now i'm contradicting myself.|S|Btr002
fe069|but even when it is very turn taking is very like people follow the turn taking rules or whatever and don't really blatantly interrupt people|D|Btr002
fe069|um|F|Btr002
fe069|and i i remember this actually from a meeting because liz was complaining there wasn't enough interruptions.|S|Btr002
fe069|or not enough overlaps or something.|S|Btr002
fe066|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|it wasn't interruptions.|S|Btr002
fe069|it was overlaps that i was thinking about.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh i think this is really|D|Btr002
fe069|not enough overlaps.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe069|and so she wanted to there to be an argument or something so that there'd be more.|S|Btr002
fe069|and what she didn't realize was that throughout the meeting up until then there had been.|S|Btr002
fe069|they were just very small.|S|Btr002
fe069|but they were there.|S|Btr002
fe069|i think they're there pretty much all the time.|S|Btr002
fe008|i agree.|S|Btr002
fe008|i did i did do one analysis where i looked at one meeting|D|Btr002
fe066|that's interesting.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|and um|F|Btr002
fe008|because the claim had been|D|Btr002
fe008|actually one of the people in the meeting had made the claim in the previous meeting that well there probably the overlaps only occur during setup and um you know at the end when we're leaving.|S|Btr002
fe069|oh.|S|Btr002
fe068|oh yeah that's totally not true.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|no not at all.|S|Btr002
fe008|exactly exactly.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|well and you know i think that that's sort of the feeling you would get if unless you looked at the data at this level.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|and so i did an analysis.|S|Btr002
fe008|and in fact it was really a pretty constant rate.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|all the way through the entire meeting.|S|Btr002
fe008|and everyone was involved.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|wasn't just one you know or two speakers.|S|Btr002
fe008|everyone was|D|Btr002
fe008|yeah it's quite true.|S|Btr002
fe066|kind of makes sense.|S|Btr002
fe066|because if you're if you want to speak next it's almost like you got you got to get your foot in the door.|S|Btr002
fe066|you got to be the one who you know make sure people recognize that you're the one who's going to speak next.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|that's true.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|i should say i didn't distinguish between overlaps and and interruptions.|S|Btr002
fe008|so some of these were backchannels and things like that.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|oh i see.|S|Btr002
fe008|but it's still it's still the case.|S|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|you have|D|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|you|D|Btr002
me070|i think um silences are generally like not good in conversation too.|S|Btr002
me070|because once you get a|D|Btr002
me070|you know it it it's to your benefit to to try to get in right when you think they're done.|S|Btr002
me070|because if there's a silence not only is it awkward but then that sort of cues everybody to start thinking of a new topic to stop the silence.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|and then you don't get to talk about what you wanted to talk about because the whole subject has changed.|S|Btr002
fe069|and then everybody talks at once.|S|Btr002
fe008|that's true that's very true.|S|Btr002
fe069|you know thinking about it|D|Btr002
me070|you know?|Q|Btr002
fe069|i i think i've only noticed a couple times where there's been actual silence on all channels for a period of time.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe069|it's only been like twice.|S|Btr002
fe008|it's true that's very rare.|S|Btr002
fe068|it's rare.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|D|Btr002
fe008|i agree.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|interesting observation.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah well if they're if this has raised a couple of things for me that i wanted to mention.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|because you know at this point we're at the at the really fine grain level of of standardization which i hadn't really thought of specifying in advance before.|S|Btr002
fe008|and um wanted to maybe just mention a couple of things.|S|Btr002
fe008|these are|D|Btr002
fe008|um|F|Btr002
fe008|yeah i don't think that these are very common.|S|Btr002
fe008|but with the idea that what we're trying to do is encode the communicative stuff.|S|Btr002
fe008|um when we have these grey areas.|S|Btr002
fe008|um um|F|Btr002
fe008|i wanted to draw attention to the fact that there are sometimes these stretches where a person is trying to say something and formulating their thought and they're coming out with a bunch of segments which really aren't part of a word.|S|Btr002
fe008|have you run across that where they're they're saying?|Q|Btr002
fe069|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah yeah yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah yeah yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|and then they say a word.|S|Btr002
fe067|oh.|D|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|and my feeling on that is that this isn't really a phonological transcript.|S|Btr002
fe008|and potentially those things could probably be rendered.|S|Btr002
fe008|although some of them are not even full segments.|S|Btr002
fe008|they're even subsegmental i would say.|S|Btr002
fe008|i mean you got a a single flap of a vocal cord sometimes.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|and you know they're it's like the the apparatus is sort of almost kicking in.|S|Btr002
fe008|they're almost going to say.|S|Btr002
fe008|but it hasn't somehow this somehow this vibration hit before the rest of it.|S|Btr002
fe008|and and that's not communicative.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|so um my my the way i do those things when i hear those if is to i use in parentheses one x. so it's marked.|S|Btr002
fe066|okay.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|or if it's then i then i put six or seven or however many it is|D|Btr002
fe069|then|D|Btr002
me070|that's what i usually do too.|S|Btr002
fe069|right.|B|Btr002
fe068|i was wondering who had been putting those in.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|great.|S|Btr002
fe008|and then and then what i do is i put in um brackets um uncodeable sorry uncodeable vocal sounds.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe068|yes.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh okay okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|and of course potentially they're codable.|S|Btr002
fe008|but i just wanted to mark roughly how how long it is.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|then indicate what what the nature of it is so no one's going to try and go back and and decode it as something that's a word that was not it has a different status than parenthesized uh parts when there are words involved.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|just to set it aside.|S|Btr002
fe008|have some sort of a length indication.|S|Btr002
fe008|and sometimes i'll even put them in a in a separate bin.|S|Btr002
fe008|although that's that's not necessary.|S|Btr002
fe008|it's just sometimes it works out that way that they.|S|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|they do this thing.|S|Btr002
fe008|i shouldn't do that so often.|S|Btr002
fe008|i'm sorry about that.|S|Btr002
fe008|they do this sound.|S|Btr002
fe008|and then there's a pause.|S|Btr002
fe008|and then they start speaking.|S|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|so then it's really obvious i can i can split it apart and it won't be any problem.|S|Btr002
fe008|i wanted to mention that one.|S|Btr002
fe068|man.|D|Btr002
fe066|i'm glad you brought that up.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|because i actually|D|Btr002
fe066|i'm one of the culprits that puts in all the little itsy bitsy tiny sounds in the middle of everything.|S|Btr002
fe069|huh.|B|Btr002
fe068|i do that too!|S|Btr002
fe066|because i was|D|Btr002
fe068|i used to do that!|S|Btr002
fe066|because|D|Btr002
fe066|yeah because i was thinking like you're just supposed to write down everything you hear as closely as possible.|S|Btr002
fe008|well|D|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|and so i'm glad you said that.|S|Btr002
fe066|because um that actually takes a good amount of time and like pretty strict concentration to to do that.|S|Btr002
fe068|a lot of time.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah i put in the x. s.|S|Btr002
fe066|um|F|Btr002
fe008|excellent.|S|Btr002
fe066|and so|F|Btr002
me070|i put in if it's um unintelligible i put i count how many syllables and then i put in six x. .|S|Btr002
fe066|i do that if it's unintelligible.|S|Btr002
fe066|but if i can tell something if somebody goes i'll put an r. .|S|Btr002
fe008|oh i see.|S|Btr002
fe008|i see.|S|Btr002
fe066|uh um so if they go i'll go r. e.h. huh m. m. .|S|Btr002
me070|oh.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|so like i i've been doing that.|S|Btr002
fe066|because like that's what i can hear.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
fe066|and i'm pretty damn sure that|D|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe066|sorry sorry!|S|Btr002
fe066|sorry hhh.|S|Btr002
me070|that will have to be transcribed with little uh symbols.|S|Btr002
fe066|sorry!|S|Btr002
fe066|i'm sorry.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah like a a skull and crossbones.|S|Btr002
fe066|i feel really bad now.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh no!|S|Btr002
fe066|i'm sorry.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|D|Btr002
fe066|okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|that's okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|it's all right.|S|Btr002
me070|you've ruined the whole meeting!|S|Btr002
fe008|no problem.|S|Btr002
me070|we can't transcribe any of it now!|S|Btr002
fe068|it's not it's|D|Btr002
fe066|oh no i'm so sorry.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah.|D|Btr002
fe068|it's not like you said the f. word.|S|Btr002
fe008|no no no.|S|Btr002
fe068|it's not it's not an|D|Btr002
fe008|this is not|D|Btr002
fe068|it's still a p.g.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah seriously.|S|Btr002
fe008|i wouldn't give it a second thought.|S|Btr002
fe069|do you remember what you were going to say?|Q|Btr002
fe066|oh yeah i i was|D|Btr002
fe068|she's pretty darn sure that uh|D|Btr002
fe066|uh and then yeah that's|D|Btr002
fe008|you|D|Btr002
fe008|yeah|F|Btr002
fe068|she could make it out probably.|S|Btr002
me070|okay right.|S|Btr002
fe066|i'm sorry.|S|Btr002
fe068|yeah no one's ever sworn in any of the meetings.|S|Btr002
fe008|well you've heard have you heard shoot?|Q|Btr002
fe068|that actually|D|Btr002
fe008|i've heard shoot a couple of times.|S|Btr002
fe066|i've heard the|D|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|not the swearword version.|S|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
fe008|no no no no no no.|S|Btr002
fe008|the|D|Btr002
fe068|just shoot.|S|Btr002
fe008|shoot type yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|i've heard the swearword version.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|that's okay.|S|Btr002
fe066|remember that?|Q|Btr002
me070|oh you have?|D|Btr002
fe008|yeah?|Q|Btr002
fe066|remember that?|Q|Btr002
me070|i've never heard the swearword versions.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh.|S|Btr002
fe066|it was a while back.|S|Btr002
fe066|i it was a long time ago.|S|Btr002
fe008|i do remember that yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah and i was like oah.|S|Btr002
fe066|i emailed you.|S|Btr002
fe066|i was like you might want to check this out.|S|Btr002
fe008|that's right that's right.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah i do remember that.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|but it was very quiet.|S|Btr002
fe066|so i can see how that would have been sort of gone over by accident.|S|Btr002
fe066|it was just very quiet.|S|Btr002
fe066|like kind of under the breath kind of thing.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|yeah it was.|S|Btr002
fe066|so that's why it was missed.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|i can understand.|S|Btr002
fe068|huh!|B|Btr002
fe067|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|but finish your point.|S|Btr002
fe008|so|D|Btr002
fe066|oh i was just i was just saying that um i i can i'm pretty sure that i can tell what exactly what sounds are being produced.|S|Btr002
fe008|yes.|S|Btr002
fe066|so if it's uh i write an r. .|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe066|if it's huh i can tell it's.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|then again i always think that it's closer to stick with the x. s.|S|Btr002
me070|because it's like how effective is you know the roman alphabet at deciphering all the sounds that a human can make?|Q|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|you know it's not the i.p.a.|S|Btr002
me070|and it's just i i just sort of think um it's best to leave it with x. s.|S|Btr002
fe067|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|because i english orthography conventions are just so you know uncertain anyway in the first place.|S|Btr002
me070|and um|F|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|you know i i usually only use them when i i know that um the person was trying to make a word.|S|Btr002
me070|i mean i know that the the word they were trying to say.|S|Btr002
me070|and that they were stuttering that.|S|Btr002
me070|then i feel fine just you know writing out the letters.|S|Btr002
me070|but otherwise i sort of don't feel right trying to write them out.|S|Btr002
me070|because i feel like it's um|D|Btr002
me070|you can't really|D|Btr002
fe066|just not useful?|Q|Btr002
me070|yeah you can't really spell those things with the with the roman alphabet.|S|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|you know?|Q|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|it's it was only set up for|D|Btr002
fe068|right.|B|Btr002
me070|it was set up for a different purpose you know.|S|Btr002
me070|not necessarily so phonological.|S|Btr002
fe008|i agree and i think there's another problem too.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe066|okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|and that is that we do have some short words which are communicative.|S|Btr002
fe008|and and sometimes|D|Btr002
fe008|so if you have an e.r. as part of one of these fragments we do have a lexicalized uh.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|which is a which is a a filler item.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|does have a meaning.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|so i think for both of the reasons it's good to just leave it in this category of not really communicating in a in a word like way.|S|Btr002
fe066|so even if it's uh or|D|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|i would keep uh.|S|Btr002
fe008|well e. uh uh if it's a filler.|S|Btr002
fe066|oh you would keep uh.|S|Btr002
fe008|so i mean uh|D|Btr002
fe066|right right.|S|Btr002
fe008|that that that stays.|S|Btr002
me070|huh|B|Btr002
fe066|right oh okay.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
me070|oh yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|but if it's uh part on these little fragments no.|S|Btr002
me070|i always|D|Btr002
me070|i often transcribe that as or.|S|Btr002
me070|i always thought that was or sort of with a strange pronunciation.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh.|S|Btr002
fe008|i'm making a distinction.|S|Btr002
fe068|oh.|S|Btr002
fe008|so you have the um comic uh where the person says something and then they pretend that they didn't want to say that.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|and then they throw in an uh.|S|Btr002
me070|oh.|S|Btr002
fe008|and that would be an uh.|S|Btr002
me070|oh i don't get that one.|S|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
me070|right.|S|Btr002
fe008|e.r.|S|Btr002
fe008|but if they're saying or in a reduced way so it comes out as uh do it as or.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
me070|okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|because that's that falls within the realm of pronunciation variants.|S|Btr002
fe069|okay.|S|Btr002
me070|okay.|S|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
me070|right.|S|Btr002
fe008|it's just like different ways of saying and.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|and i have like uh uh two more things i wanted to say.|S|Btr002
fe008|one of them is um|D|Btr002
fe008|oh yeah.|F|Btr002
fe008|this is an interesting category to me.|S|Btr002
fe008|and i don't um don't have to mark this systematically.|S|Btr002
fe008|but when you're going through the meeting and what i'd like people to do if if you're not uh uh is to go through the meeting|D|Btr002
fe008|um|F|Btr002
fe008|so if you're doing you're doing separate channels first and then as a final pass through the mixed channel.|S|Btr002
fe008|i don't think i've made that explicit.|S|Btr002
fe008|but it it's really helpful to go through it a a final time though the mixed channel so that you hear things in context.|S|Btr002
fe008|and at that point what i sometimes pick up is this meta level where someone is finishes someone's someone else's utterance|D|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|D|Btr002
fe008|so you'll suddenly have this stranded word out in the middle of nowhere and it's because.|S|Btr002
fe008|this other speaker on this other channel was trying to formulate this thought and they paused.|S|Btr002
fe008|and they paused just enough that this person leaped in and gave them a word.|S|Btr002
fe069|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|and i think those are interesting.|S|Btr002
fe008|so when i find that i i note note it as you know finishing.|S|Btr002
fe008|put capital letters.|S|Btr002
fe008|capital letter capital letter colon apostrophe s. utterance.|S|Btr002
fe069|oh.|S|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe068|wait wait how do you mark it?|S|Btr002
me070|wait.|S|Btr002
fe066|we add the|D|Btr002
fe008|so if so in the in the instance in which|D|Btr002
fe008|let's say that um morgan's talking.|S|Btr002
fe008|uh so he's talking.|S|Btr002
fe008|and then somewhere there's a bit of a pause.|S|Btr002
fe008|and let's say adam fills in a word for him.|S|Btr002
fe008|then what i do is on adam's channel i say i say completing and this this isn't that common of an occurrence completing speaker initial with a colon apostrophe s. s utterance.|S|Btr002
fe068|oh i see.|S|Btr002
fe069|oh.|S|Btr002
me070|oh.|B|Btr002
fe068|okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|and what that means is at the time when we|D|Btr002
fe008|see we're going to go to a stage of anonymization.|S|Btr002
fe008|so it's important to have the colon here.|S|Btr002
me070|oh.|B|Btr002
fe008|because that'll make it possible to easily know you know who it was without having to do the math involved in figuring out which channel it was.|S|Btr002
fe008|the problem with|D|Btr002
fe008|i originally wanted to use channel numbers as the referent index.|S|Btr002
fe008|but that that's not functional.|S|Btr002
fe008|because we have these two different numbering schemes.|S|Btr002
fe008|you have the numbering in the channeltrans interface and you have the numbering in the key file.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|and those can be very different.|S|Btr002
me070|right right.|B|Btr002
fe008|so you know to be able to|D|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|uh this is redundant in a useful way in that you know that you're not going to make a mistake.|S|Btr002
fe008|i tried to do it with the numbers.|S|Btr002
fe008|and i was making all sorts of inconsistent problems so i stopped it.|S|Btr002
fe066|so that's probably why you like added in that um thing that automatically puts in the people's initials.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|initials?|Q|Btr002
fe008|that's that's i did that partly to keep track of things.|S|Btr002
fe008|absolutely.|S|Btr002
fe008|absolutely.|S|Btr002
fe069|i also found that it was easier to deal with the meetings when there are speaker initials.|S|Btr002
fe066|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe066|oh yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|initials.|S|Btr002
fe008|the initials?|Q|Btr002
fe008|i'm glad to hear that.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|i i didn't do that systematically until uh really rather recently.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|B|Btr002
fe008|so i'm glad to know that's useful.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|it takes an extra step.|S|Btr002
fe008|glad it's useful.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay now i just have one more thing to say.|S|Btr002
fe008|and that is that|D|Btr002
fe008|um um|F|Btr002
fe008|like once this is just such a|D|Btr002
fe008|i'm getting down to like the really eensy-weensy stuff.|S|Btr002
fe008|but um once i found a comment that uh in curly brackets about mumbling.|S|Btr002
fe008|and um|F|Btr002
fe008|that's that's this is just to mention an instance that happened once.|S|Btr002
fe008|it's really grasping for details.|S|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|but um|F|Btr002
fe008|i i i think and it may be that it was not from anybody here.|S|Btr002
fe008|so|F|Btr002
fe008|but i think that um mumble is only useful in the to me in the sense of whispered.|S|Btr002
fe008|if it's like a manner of speaking in which case it's a qual.|S|Btr002
fe008|but not in terms of replacing like this string of undecipherable fragments.|S|Btr002
fe008|so|F|Btr002
me070|oh right.|S|Btr002
fe066|right oh yeah.|S|Btr002
fe069|okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|um this this was when it was used.|S|Btr002
me070|they used mumble for|D|Btr002
fe008|exactly.|S|Btr002
fe008|it was used in place of uh something that was unintelligible.|S|Btr002
fe069|okay.|D|Btr002
fe066|to fill in i see.|S|Btr002
me070|huh.|B|Btr002
me070|right.|S|Btr002
fe008|in which case it would be better to use parentheses and and either exclamation or the number of syllables if you know.|S|Btr002
me070|the number x. .|S|Btr002
fe068|and then do qual mumbled or qual whispered or something.|S|Btr002
fe008|exactly if it's a manner of speaking then it's useful.|S|Btr002
fe068|i see.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|and otherwise the parentheses with an estimate of syllables is better.|S|Btr002
fe069|okay.|B|Btr002
fe068|okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|so i guess you know i don't want to keep you.|S|Btr002
fe008|i kept you so long.|S|Btr002
fe069|can i ask one more thing about these comments?|Q|Btr002
fe008|i really appreciate this.|S|Btr002
fe008|yes.|S|Btr002
fe069|so we are for|D|Btr002
fe069|qual is used for things like whispered or said while laughing or things of that nature.|S|Btr002
fe008|yes.|S|Btr002
fe008|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|um i remember at some point we were doing a difference between vocal and non vocal sounds.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh yes.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh but|D|Btr002
fe008|good question.|S|Btr002
fe008|and you don't have to add any of those tags.|S|Btr002
fe069|oh.|S|Btr002
fe008|the only tags that you need to add is|D|Btr002
fe008|so uh there's like one exception that's just microscopic.|S|Btr002
fe008|and that is sometimes|D|Btr002
fe008|this is again really rare.|S|Btr002
fe008|sometimes i've run across the word noise.|S|Btr002
fe008|and offhand i don't know if that's a vocal noise or non vocal noise.|S|Btr002
fe066|huh.|D|Btr002
fe008|and so then i listen to it and i figure it out.|S|Btr002
fe008|but that's the only place you would use a vocal non vocal tag.|S|Btr002
fe008|where it's potentially ambiguous between those two categories.|S|Btr002
fe008|because otherwise what i do when i get these is|D|Btr002
fe008|and of course i do my checks.|S|Btr002
fe008|and then i have a um a script that i wrote which will separate everything in out that has curly brackets.|S|Btr002
fe008|do a listing of them.|S|Btr002
me070|huh.|D|Btr002
fe008|and then anything|D|Btr002
fe008|some of them already have tags from some previous uh modification.|S|Btr002
fe008|but anything that doesn't i just go through this list and i i tag it right then.|S|Btr002
fe008|and so in one in one in one change i can modify you know five hundred instances of this.|S|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe069|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|so there's no need to add the vocal or the non vocal.|S|Btr002
fe069|very efficient.|S|Btr002
fe069|okay but for like noise that we know is something like mike noise or something like a door whatever then we can mark it as that.|S|Btr002
fe068|huh.|B|Btr002
fe066|right.|B|Btr002
fe068|uhhuh.|B|Btr002
fe008|yes.|B|Btr002
fe069|and|D|Btr002
fe008|you can either if you mark it mike noise then i'll know what kind of noise it is when i go through the thing and put v.o.c. or n.v.c. on the in the substitution file.|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah right.|S|Btr002
fe069|or|D|Btr002
fe069|or if it's|D|Btr002
me070|uhhuh.|D|Btr002
fe069|right.|B|Btr002
fe008|but it's it's uh very efficient for me to add those tags later.|S|Btr002
fe069|okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|it's really not the same thing with the qual.|S|Btr002
fe008|just so long as i can tell which of those three categories it is.|S|Btr002
fe008|or or pron.|S|Btr002
fe008|but you know those that's really very obvious.|S|Btr002
fe008|the pronunciation.|S|Btr002
me070|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|so long as i can tell what they are.|S|Btr002
fe069|so we do need to add that one?|Q|Btr002
fe008|i think it's good for you to add the pron.|S|Btr002
fe069|okay sure okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|i would appreciate the pron come to think of it.|S|Btr002
fe068|good.|S|Btr002
fe008|but the other three just so long as it's clear to me you know from the comment which of those three it is then i'm fine.|S|Btr002
fe068|good.|S|Btr002
fe008|that's great.|S|Btr002
fe008|all right so um i guess um|D|Btr002
fe068|do you want to read digits?|Q|Btr002
fe068|do you want to do that?|Q|Btr002
fe008|oh thank you.|S|Btr002
fe008|do we have time?|Q|Btr002
fe008|would you mind?|Q|Btr002
fe069|yeah that's fine.|S|Btr002
fe008|can we do digits?|Q|Btr002
me070|yeah that's fine.|S|Btr002
fe068|no.|S|Btr002
fe066|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay so why don't|D|Btr002
fe008|do you want to do it uh in unison this time?|Q|Btr002
fe069|that's what we did last time.|S|Btr002
fe068|well we did it in unison last time.|S|Btr002
fe066|we did it|D|Btr002
fe008|oh we did!|S|Btr002
fe069|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe008|oh.|S|Btr002
me070|right.|S|Btr002
fe008|do it separately then okay.|S|Btr002
fe068|sure did.|S|Btr002
me070|yes.|S|Btr002
fe008|good deal.|S|Btr002
fe068|oh and do you want us to mark the roughly the time we start?|Q|Btr002
fe008|that is really what that time field is.|S|Btr002
fe008|i used to think it was the beginning of the meeting.|S|Btr002
me070|oh okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|but yes.|S|Btr002
fe008|quite right quite right.|S|Btr002
fe068|oh okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|that'd be good.|S|Btr002
me070|oh all right.|S|Btr002
fe066|the time we start digits?|Q|Btr002
fe068|so we have to|D|Btr002
fe069|huh.|D|Btr002
fe008|yeah.|S|Btr002
fe066|okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay so who wants to start?|S|Btr002
fe008|well i guess i'll start.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|um|F|Btr002
fe008|okay i wanted to make one comment and that is some of these are like two digits.|S|Btr002
fe008|and just be sure you say both digits separately.|S|Btr002
fe008|so one eight instead of eighteen.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay?|Q|Btr002
fe068|sure.|S|Btr002
me070|oh right.|S|Btr002
fe066|i can go.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay.|S|Btr002
fe008|okay wonderful.|S|Btr002
fe008|thank you very very much.|S|Btr002
fe008|i really appreciate this.|S|Btr002
fe068|no problem.|S|Btr002
me070|sure.|S|Btr002
fe008|and um so now we get to turn the microphones off.|S|Btr002
fe066|sure.|S|Btr002
fe008|and uh|F|Btr002
