A|The only experience I have,|sd|4384
A|I don't have any children|sd|4384
A|but I've, uh, I was a baby-sitter in high school.|sd|4384
A|And then, just recently, after we were married, I baby-sat for a dentist while she worked.|sd|4384
A|And I just, uh ...|%|4384
B|<talking> Yeah.|b|4384
B|That's the only thing I've ever done also, is baby-sit.|sd|4384
A|Is it? ery faint.|qy|4384
B|But, uh, I've heard people that I work with talk about, you know, child care.|sd|4384
B|Especially, I guess it's even harder on single mothers.|sv|4384
A|Oh, yeah.|aa|4384
A|The expense.|sd|4384
B|Yeah.|b|4384
B|Having to pick up the kid by, you know, six o'clock|^2|4384
B|or it's five dollars for every minute you're late. And stuff like that|sd|4384
A|Uh-huh.|b|4384
B|Which is understandable.|sv|4384
B|I mean, these people can't, you know, stay there till eight o'clock because somebody has to work late|sv|4384
A|Just sit around|^2|4384
A|That that's true.|aa|4384
B|but|%|4384
A|See the lady I did it for,|sd|4384
A|that's why she picked me is because I would go to her house so she wouldn't have to get her little girl up.|sd|4384
A|So she could sleep in.|sd|4384
A|And, uh, then she could be at home|sd|4384
A|and then I'd bring her to my house for a couple of hours if I wanted too or whatever.|sd|4384
A|But, uh, she paid, I think it was two or, I think it was about two fifty, three dollars a hour|sd|4384
A|and by the time I paid taxes on it, it, I was getting like eighty cents|sd|4384
A|and that wasn't counting food or gas or anything.|sd|4384
B|Oh, no.|ba|4384
B|Yeah.|b|4384
B|It's hardly worth your time.|sv|4384
A|Yeah.|b|4384
B|Yeah.|b^m|4384
B|That's pretty bad.|sv|4384
B|The only time I baby-sat was in high school|sd|4384
B|and it, you know,|%|4384
B|of course you don't|%|4384
B|I didn't pay taxes on that,|sd|4384
B|so.|%|4384
A|Right.|b|4384
B|It was easy, you know, go over to some, uh,|sv|4384
B|it was these people that lived in our neighborhood|sd|4384
B|and I'd just go over there.|sd|4384
B|Every Thursday night, they went to the theater.|sd|4384
B|They had permanent tickets|sd|4384
B|and they'd give me,|sd|4384
B|it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids,|sd|4384
B|but they would usually give me like five dollars more at the end of the night.|sd|4384
A|Oh, wow.|ba|4384
B|And, I mean, they'd, you know,|%|4384
B|it was great.|sv|4384
B|I'd go over there|sd|4384
B|and there would be like, uh, you know, there's, we have these videos over here.|sd|4384
B|Watch, whatever you want.|^q|4384
B|And there's some Oreos in the, in the cupboard.|^q|4384
B|And there's some Coke|^q|4384
B|and you know, just help yourself to anything.|^q|4384
B|So it was, it was, you know, the best,|sv|4384
A|Wow.|ba|4384
B|that was a long time ago|sd|4384
B|and that was only for a few years.|sd|4384
B|Just once a week.|sd|4384
A|Yeah.|b|4384
B|But I don't know.|h|4384
A|I think people that treat their baby-sitters like that get a lot better baby-sitters.|sv|4384
B|Oh, yeah.|aa|4384
B|That's true.|aa|4384
A|And they stick around for longer.|sv|4384
A|Because I mean after I figured out I was getting eighty cents an hour, I said bag it.|sd|4384
A|And I quit you know.|sd|4384
B|Yeah.|b|4384
A|I was just like but I'm wasting my time.|sd|4384
B|Yeah.|b|4384
A|I really liked the little girl and everything|sd|4384
A|but I thought ...|sd|4384
B|She does take up,|^2|4384
B|and they do take up a lot of your time.|sv|4384
B|That ...|%|4384
A|Yeah.|aa|4384
A|Yeah,|aa|4384
A|I ...|%|4384
B|They're very demanding|sv|4384
A|Uh-huh.|b|4384
A|Well, and she was really spoiled.|sd|4384
A|They didn't make her eat anything she didn't want or anything.|sd|4384
A|So, basically, they fed her cookies for breakfast and lunch.|sd|4384
A|And the mom was a dentist|sd|4384
A|and I was just like, we've got to quit this.|sd|4384
A|And she's like no I don't want her to starve.|sd|4384
A|But I don't want to make her eat something she doesn't want to eat|^q|4384
B|Oh, shoot.|ba|4384
B|My mom would be like, uh eat it or don't eat anything.|sd|4384
A|Eat this or <laughter>.|^2|4384
B|That's right.|aa|4384
A|So, I can see the concerns on what different people want.|sv|4384
B|Yeah.|b|4384
A|Because some,|%|4384
A|I mean, you know, if I was setting up a daycare, there would be so many needs you would have to customize your service to.|sv|4384
B|Yeah.|b|4384
B|Uh-huh.|b|4384
A|Cause some parents won't put up anything. Where others would.|sv|4384
B|I think,|%|4384
B|yeah,|b|4384
B|I think the best way to go would just be to, to be able to do it out of your basement.|sv|4384
A|Uh-huh.|b|4384
B|And just have like at the most, like ten kids.|sv|4384
B|And all from maybe people that you know type of thing.|sv|4384
A|No.|ar|4384
B|Instead of trying actually to set up a daycare where you don't know the people coming in and ...|sv|4384
A|That's true.|aa|4384
A|I, I'd love to do it.|sd|4384
A|But I just don't trust people now.|sd|4384
A|There's too many lawsuits.|sv|4384
B|Yeah.|b|4384
A|I just, I think it's a bigger risk than ...|sv|4384
B|More than what it's worth?|bf|4384
A|Yeah.|aa|4384
B|Yeah.|b^m|4384
A|It would scare me.|sd|4384
A|With,|%|4384
A|I don't know,|h|4384
A|cause I'm sure some of them have good reason to sue|sv|4384
A|but I think a lot of them are just, you know, they're negligent|sv|4384
A|and they get happy about money|sv|4384
A|and they just want to sue you.|sv|4384
B|Yeah.|b|4384
B|Well, yeah.|aa|4384
B|That's,|%|4384
B|yeah,|aa|4384
B|exactly.|aa|4384
B|When you have like a Kindercare or something set up and when they get greedy or whatever, that's when they have maybe one assistant to twenty kids or something|sv|4384
A|Uh-huh.|b|4384
A|Oh, yeah.|b|4384
B|And that's just, you know,|%|4384
B|you can't watch that many little kids getting into things at one time|sv|4384
A|That's impossible.|sv|4384
B|You know, you never know what they're going to get into.|sv|4384
A|I have a girlfriend that works at a daycare|sd|4384
A|and she takes her little girl with her|sd|4384
A|and, I mean, she told me about half the people that they hire|sd|4384
A|and half of them she'd like to turn them into the state|sd|4384
A|And that's the people that are working there, you know.|sd|4384
A|And then she would like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition the kids are in, you know.|sd|4384
B|Oh, that's horrible.|ba|4384
A|Like they'll be in the same clothes they were the day before, the same diaper.|sd|4384
B|Huh.|b|4384
A|You know, just awful things.|sd|4384
A|And so I don't know.|h|4384
A|I don't have kids|sd|4384
A|but I always think man I just don't know if I could trust anybody.|sv|4384
A|I mean, you just don't know.|sv|4384
B|Yeah.|b|4384
B|That's|%|4384
B|yeah,|b|4384
B|that's a hard thing about it.|sv|4384
B|If, I mean, I I can't foresee myself getting married|sv|4384
B|but if, you know, if I ever wanted to have a kid, how could I work.|qh|4384
B|I mean, I don't think I could trust somebody with my kid either.|sv|4384
B|Unless it was a friend that, you know, did it in ounds like an airplane their house that I knew well.|sv|4384
A|Oh, yeah.|aa|4384
A|That's true.|aa|4384
A|Yeah.|b|4384
B|I just, I couldn't do it I don't think.|sv|4384
A|It would just rip me apart, I think|sv|4384
A|I don't know.|h|4384
B|Yeah.|b|4384
A|Just not knowing.|sd|4384
B|Yeah,|b|4384
B|just besides the fact that, you know, your, when your child gets out of school at three o'clock and then has to wait.|sd|4384
