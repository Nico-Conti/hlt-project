B|Have you had any snow up your way?|qy|3936
A|No,|nn|3936
A|we haven't had any since, uh, oh, just before Christmas|sd|3936
A|and, uh we had a lot before Christmas.|sd|3936
B|Um.|b|3936
A|The ski resorts were really|sd|3936
A|and, uh,|%|3936
A|but, now we have, we've had fog, for about forty days in a row and temperature inversion,|sd|3936
A|so,|%|3936
A|but no, uh, no snow.|ng|3936
B|Um.|b|3936
A|The snows all melted off uh,|sd|3936
B|Well, I talked to a woman who lived up in the hills, uh, mountains in, uh, Utah, I guess this last weekend|sd|3936
B|and she had, uh, quite a bit of snow on the ground her way.|sd|3936
A|Uh-huh,|b|3936
A|I guess there's different parts of the state of Utah that, that, does have some,|sv|3936
A|but not,|%|3936
A|usually we have up to a hundred and fifty inches up at the ski resorts|sd|3936
A|and they're down between thirty-eight and, uh, forty inches.|sd|3936
B|Um|b|3936
A|At this time of the year,|sd|3936
A|and we've been in a drought for the last five years|sd|3936
A|and this is the sixth year|sd|3936
A|and it's getting quite serious, as far as water next summer.|sv|3936
B|Yeah,|b|3936
B|well, the weather, uh, here, is always a topic of conversation in Texas.|sd|3936
A|Right.|b|3936
B|But, uh, we have wide variations and have warm weather when most people have cold weather,|sd|3936
B|but we have our share of cold weather as well.|sd|3936
B|The, uh, temperature this morning was right at freezing.|sd|3936
B|It didn't stay there,|sd|3936
B|but it was right at,|sd|3936
A|Oh, that's, that's different, isn't it?|qy|3936
A|Um.|b|3936
B|We usually have some of our coldest weather toward the, uh, end of January,|sd|3936
B|but this year it wasn't bad at all.|sv|3936
B|I guess that's because we had so much rain.|sv|3936
A|I know my son was telling me about the rain down there.|sd|3936
A|He said it was just,|sd|3936
A|and we read in the newspaper, southern part of Texas I flooded out,|sd|3936
B|Oh, yeah.|b|3936
A|and, uh,|%|3936
B|Well, my, uh, my sister lives in Houston|sd|3936
B|and they, uh, the river there was, uh, in the flooding stage near where her son lives,|sd|3936
B|and that, uh, caused some, uh, concern, of course.|sd|3936
A|Oh, boy.|ba|3936
B|They have a, uh, lake cabin|sd|3936
B|and, uh, their dock was completely under water on the lake.|sd|3936
A|Oh, my gosh.|ba|3936
B|So we really had a lot of rain.|sd|3936
A|Yeah my son in Plano, he lives fairly close to,|sd|3936
A|there's quite a wash that goes down, uh, through Plano|sd|3936
B|Right.|b|3936
A|and, uh, there's walking trails on both sides, a walking path,|sd|3936
A|and, uh, when I've gone down to visit him I've gone on that,|sd|3936
A|but, uh, that was clear full and up to, up to some of the streets, I guess.|sd|3936
A|It just|%|3936
B|Yeah,|b|3936
B|we had a lot of flash floods in the area.|sd|3936
B|We had a few people who ran into, uh, water and a few fatalities, uh, just a few.|sd|3936
A|Uh-huh.|b|3936
B|Not more than ten|sd|3936
B|but,|%|3936
A|That's funny that, uh, we can't have it in moderation instead of having either a drought or having too much.|sv|3936
B|Well, the, uh, there's an old profane expression about Texas weather,|sd|3936
B|it's always too damn cold, too damn hot, too damn windy|^q|3936
A|Yeah,|b|3936
A|well, it's, uh, interesting,|sv|3936
A|uh,|%|3936
A|I'm going down to El Paso next week|sd|3936
A|and, uh, I was wondering what the weather was,|sd|3936
A|but I imagine if it's that cold in Dallas it,|sv|3936
B|Well, El Paso won't be cold.|ar|3936
A|It's not a, doesn't get that cold, I guess, huh?|qy|3936
B|No,|nn|3936
B|it's, it's, quite southern|sd|3936
B|and it's, it's rare to get real cold in, in El Paso.|sd|3936
A|Uh-huh.|b|3936
B|The, uh, you'll be flying in there?|qy^d|3936
A|Yes.|ny|3936
B|Well, uh, take off is, uh, fun from El Paso because you normally,|sv|3936
B|the way the winds are you take off right toward the mountain, the Rockies|sd|3936
A|Yes.|b|3936
B|and they're towering above you|sd|3936
B|and so you circle back over the air and then make a circle around and come back over again.|sd|3936
A|Yeah,|b|3936
A|we're kind of used to that here in Utah,|sd|3936
A|course, there are mountains,|sd|3936
A|and I fly into Montana a lot|sd|3936
A|and we have a,|%|3936
A|the mountains are, are really, uh, high|sd|3936
A|and a lot of places we go in to, you just kind of, uh,|sd|3936
A|it's in the little valley,|sd|3936
A|but, I, uh, sure hope we,|sd|3936
A|we really need the moisture.|sv|3936
A|I hope we can get, uh, get some.|sd|3936
A|There's supposed to be a storm,|sd|3936
A|but it split, went down through, uh, northern Arizona and southern Utah|sd|3936
A|and they're not predicting any for the next, uh, week anyway up here|sd|3936
A|so,|%|3936
B|Well, I noticed on the weather map on, uh, cable network that there was supposed to be a storm front moving into California and on down your way,|sd|3936
B|but I guess it didn't pan out, huh?|qy|3936
A|Yeah,|b|3936
A|well, that's, that's what the,|%|3936
A|above, uh,|%|3936
A|some of it went to the south and some to the north up into Montana,|sd|3936
A|so that just left us,|sd|3936
A|we got a high pressure system which been sitting in the|sd|3936
B|Huh.|b|3936
A|and, uh, we broke the record for the amount of fog that we've had, uh, you know|sd|3936
B|Oh, boy.|ba|3936
A|airport's been shut down, uh, till about noon every day|sd|3936
A|and then they seed the clouds, or seed the fog to try to to get the airplanes in and out.|sd|3936
B|Uh-huh.|b|3936
B|Huh.|b|3936
B|Well, we, uh, had a bad siege last, uh, Christmas a year ago.|sd|3936
B|We went up to visit my wife's, uh, sister who lives in, uh, Calgary, Alberta, Can,|sd|3936
