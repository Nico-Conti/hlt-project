B|Yeah.|b|4643|1
B|Kind of jack of all trades, master of none.|bf|4643|1
A|Yeah,|aa|4643|0

B|That's great!|ba|4643|1
A|And then I, it's like well the thrill is gone|%|4643|0
A|so let's do something else.|sd|4643|0
B|Right.|aa|4643|1
B|You want to, uh, explore a new field|bf|4643|1
B|or, or,|%|4643|1

B|Oh, okay.|bk|4643|1
A|So, I'm a licensed teacher|sd|4643|0
A|but jobs being what they are, I substitute teach|sd|4643|0
B|Yeah.|b|4643|1
A|and that way I have time for my kids too.|sd|4643|0
A|And I've been fortunate that I can afford to work part-time.|sv|4643|0
A|I don't know how long that's going to last|sd|4643|0
B|Oh, yeah.|b|4643|1
A|And, uh, they're cutting back,|sd|4643|0
A|so I don't go in all that often|sd|4643|0
A|but I've been real interested in some of those cute country, country kind of things.|sd|4643|0
A|Uh, I see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars|sd|4643|0
A|and I say, oh no|sd|4643|0
A|and , and I go|sd|4643|0
A|and I make it.|sd|4643|0
B|Yeah.|b|4643|1
A|That's how I started jewelry making.|sd|4643|0
A|I, I love to cook.|sd|4643|0
B|Oh, that's great.|ba|4643|1
A|And I saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas and, and, and knife and, and a fork and all kinds of stuff|sd|4643|0
A|and I went|sd|4643|0
A|and I signed up for class because then again, you get, you know, get someone to guide you|sd|4643|0
A|and you get the tools you don't feel like buying.|sd|4643|0
B|Exactly.|aa|4643|1
A|And I made a necklace that I saw in a gallery for three hundred twenty dollars|sd|4643|0
A|It took me a lot of time|sd|4643|0
A|but  it didn't,|sd|4643|0
B|Oh, yeah.|b|4643|1
A|but if it cost me twenty dollars, you know,|sd|4643|0
A|and then I,|%|4643|0
B|And your time,|^2|4643|1
B|then you're that much farther ahead|sv|4643|1
A|Yeah.|b|4643|0
A|Then I saw a, one of these country looking wood watermelons.|sd|4643|0
A|It was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it.|sd|4643|0
B|Right.|b|4643|1
B|I've seen them|sd|4643|1
B|and then the watermelon, the red with the, with the seeds painted in|sd|4643|1
B|and,|sd|4643|1
A|Oh, yeah.|b|4643|0
A|Uh-huh.|b|4643|0
B|That's neat.|sv|4643|1
A|I went there,|sd|4643|0
A|we have Home Depot out here.|sd|4643|0
A|I don't know if you've heard of it.|qy^d|4643|0
A|I went|sd|4643|0
A|and I got two six foot inch thick boards turned into a watermelon.|sd|4643|0
B|Yes.|ny|4643|1
B|We have one.|sd|4643|1
A|I had to cut into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lath|sd|4643|0
A|and cutting that wedge out was no joke|sd|4643|0
B|Huh.|b|4643|1
B|Oh, I'm, I'm sure.|ba|4643|1
A|We did it on a, I had a, uh, I did it through Adult Ed again.|sd|4643|0
B|A band saw?|qy^d|4643|1
B|What?|br|4643|1
A|I did it through Adult Ed again.|sd|4643|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|4643|1
A|And the teacher was one of these negative people,|sd|4643|0
A|oh that's dangerous,|^q|4643|0
A|we can't do that,|^q|4643|0
A|we just can't do that.|^q|4643|0
A|And I'm going well how about this way?|sd|4643|0
A|I, I want to do that,|^q|4643|0
A|that was the plan here|^q|4643|0
B|Right.|b|4643|1
A|So we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of a cradle for it.|sd|4643|0
B|A cradle for it.|^2|4643|1
B|Yeah,|b|4643|1
B|so you can steady it|bf|4643|1
B|and then, you used a handsaw or a backsaw?|qy|4643|1
A|Well, it, the instructions in the book I had said use a coping saw|sd|4643|0
A|but there's no coping saw big enough to, for a fourteen inch wide watermelon <laughter> that|sd|4643|0
B|Right,|b|4643|1
B|right.|b|4643|1
A|and he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular saw.|sd|4643|0
A|I said I'm not that steady,|sd|4643|0
A|it's not going to happen.|^q|4643|0
B|Yeah.|b|4643|1
A|So we built a cradle for it|sd|4643|0
A|and we got once it was turned, we got one one cut out on the table saw, on the radial saw,|sd|4643|0
A|by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about|sd|4643|0
B|Right.|b|4643|1
A|So,|%|4643|0
B|Now did you cut a quarter wedge in this?|qy|4643|1
A|Uh, I'd say it's about an eighth.|ng|4643|0
A|You know|%|4643|0
B|Well, I, I'm envisioning, uh, uh, a a watermelon like a log|sd|4643|1
B|and then, uh, what I've seen of this kind before is you have the, uh, the, uh,|%|4643|1
B|it's, uh,|sd|4643|1
B|if you're looking at adding on you have,|sd|4643|1
