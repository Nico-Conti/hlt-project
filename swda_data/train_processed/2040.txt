A|Yes,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|2040
A|um, I was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood, independence, or the status quo for Puerto Rico.|qy|2040
B|I was a resident, although very young of the of what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fifty-nine when Alaska stopped being a territory and became a state.|sd|2040
B|Uh, so I guess I have a left over positive feeling about the question even though I don't know very much about Puerto Rico.|sd|2040
B|Uh, I know that all the things that happened, relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive, uh,|sd|2040
B|and I have a suspicion that, that I believe that a, the statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or, or let it go, one or the other.|sv|2040
B|What is your situation?|qo|2040
A|Well, I'm, I guess I don't have such close experience with, with, um, an area becoming a state as you do.|sd|2040
A|Um, my concern is the economy because as I understand it Puerto Rico has a very low uh, standard of living or at least, um, annual average income.|sv|2040
A|Um, part of this I suppose is justified in, in that the climate they don't need, perhaps, the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need.|sv|2040
A|However, in that case, I guess I would favor status quo.|sv|2040
A|I have been to Puerto Rico and, and found it very, very interesting.|sd|2040
A|I did Peace Corps training there.|sd|2040
B|Oh that's very interesting.|ba|2040
A|And so, um, you know, I saw it, also as a young student|sd|2040
A|and, and it was very foreign in a certain sense, although I had grown up in California|sd|2040
A|and so the Spanish was no problem.|sd|2040
A|Um, it was, it was, you know, very lovely|sd|2040
A|and, and the people seemed very friendly and, and nice.|sd|2040
A|I have,|sd|2040
A|actually, I work with, uh, a girl from Puerto Rico|sd|2040
A|and, I guess I have never thought to ask her what she favors, um.|sd|2040
B|Your concern on the economy was one in terms of, if it became a state would that put even more pressures on, on Puerto Rico, or pressures on the U. S. in terms of aid|qy|2040
B|or,|%|2040
A|Well probably more on, in terms of the U. S. Um,|sv|2040
A|you know, I'm, I'm not quite sure how the U. S. copes with this sort of thing.|sd|2040
A|I've live abroad most of my life,|sd|2040
A|so, I guess I, I've been very cut off.|sd|2040
A|I lived actually in Lebanon,|sd|2040
A|so, I was very cut off from the, the press as I, you know, and be, was becoming an adult.|sd|2040
A|So, I don't know how the U. S. would cope with, uh, a new state that is so very, very poor.|sd|2040
B|Uh-huh.|b|2040
A|Um, I guess, you know, we'd have a lot of aid, if, if you consider the inner cities of like New York and, and how much aid it needs.|sv|2040
A|I suppose the whole country, or the whole, um, new state would require such aid.|sv|2040
B|I guess, um, we're assuming that, that Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than, than say Mississippi|qy^d|2040
B|or,|%|2040
A|I think so.|na|2040
B|Okay,|bk|2040
B|that's something that, that I guess I have not much of an image of other than, than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a perjuritive sense but in a, in a carefree sense, I guess.|sd|2040
B|Although I'm aware of the political problems and unrest, and, and also difficulties they have. Um, I don't know whether state statehood would improve their economy.|sv|2040
B|I don't, I don't know that the the act of being a state would have any impact on, on them.|sd|2040
B|Uh, I guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now.|sv|2040
B|But of course if their economy is weak there is not much of a base on which to tax.|sd|2040
B|I don't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as being, since they aren't a state, whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be.|sd|2040
B|How do you feel, though, about,|qh|2040
B|well I guess it's to their advantage to be a territory,|sv|2040
B|but, um, I wonder how have, having been in a territory but only as a young student|sd|2040
B|and my parents were in the military at the time|sd|2040
B|so they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in, in Alaska at the time since they voted absentee.|sd|2040
B|I, I would imagine that it must be a little bit of a feeling of second class citizenry, uh, to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote.|sv|2040
B|The District of Columbia people, for instance are quite frustrated, I think, at times in their not having a Senate representative.|sv|2040
A|Uh-huh.|b|2040
A|Yeah,|%|2040
A|those, are good points, um, which obviously I had never thought about.|sd|2040
A|Uh, I don't know, uh, I suppose they also, not being a state are probably freer to determine their own, um, ways of life than they would if, if,|sv|2040
A|I'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory.|sd|2040
B|Uh-huh.|b|2040
B|Uh, I see what you mean,|aa|2040
B|so that,|%|2040
B|Yeah,|b|2040
B|taxes would undoubtedly be occurring.|sv|2040
B|Uh, there,|%|2040
B|I don't know, I don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation.|sd|2040
B|Um, frequently the laws in a territory are, are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states,|sv|2040
B|I,|%|2040
B|and I'm thinking in terms of education.|sd|2040
B|But then again each state sets its own|sd|2040
B|and I don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like Puerto Rico.|sd|2040
B|Um, it's interesting because I haven't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to, uh, economy, uh, I had thought of it more in terms of political, uh, realization|sd|2040
B|and I guess I had automatically made the assumption that, gee, anyone would rather be a state of the U. S. than an independent country|sd|2040
B|so,|%|2040
A|Uh-huh.|b|2040
A|Well, well actually I|%|2040
A|one, one thing that I remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that they've recently voted that Spanish is the official language, which I always assumed it was anyway.|sd|2040
A|So, if they've just taken such action, it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state, or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish, or Hispanic heritage.|sd|2040
B|Uh-huh,|b|2040
B|well that's interesting too.|ba|2040
B|Well it sounds as though you are in favor of, uh, status quo.|qy^d|2040
A|I, I believe I would probably tend towards that.|na|2040
B|And I think, uh, having listened to you relative to the economy thing, I think if I were being forced to make a decision I would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these.|sd|2040
B|So I'm I guess I'm ultimately in favor of status quo also at this point, leaning towards the statehood.|sv|2040
A|Well that's interesting.|ba|2040
A|Right.|b|2040
A|What about if, if, um, they demanded to have Spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood.|qh|2040
B|I think I would be troubled,|sv|2040
B|I suspect, I believe that any of our states,|sd|2040
B|and I,|%|2040
B|constitutionally I don't think there are any prescriptions against that decision even if Louisiana chose to go with Creole or something.|sd|2040
B|Um, I don't think there is any prohibitions.|sd|2040
B|I would be bothered by that.|sv|2040
B|I'm, I'm bothered by any tendency to resist what I think was one of America's strengths|sv|2040
B|and that's the, the, the melting pot.|sd|2040
A|Uh-huh.|b|2040
B|Uh, I, I am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines,|sd|2040
B|but I'm troubled by too close a clinging to, to the past|sv|2040
B|and I'm also realizing that, that a common language, I think, is the ultimate bond of a country.|sv|2040
A|Uh-huh.|b|2040
B|And Canada, I guess, comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to French Quebec and whatever.|sd|2040
B|Uh, that I, I think that would be a negative step to make|sd|2040
B|and I think that that they would need to reassess that.|sv|2040
B|Um, I'm troubled even in by bilingualism, uh, in so far that it it gets in the way of, of, of the melting pot aspect.|sv|2040
A|Uh-huh,|b|2040
A|uh-huh.|b|2040
A|That's interesting because although I tend to be bilingual, Spanish based on experience, um, I was in bilingual education in California|sd|2040
A|and I didn't have any problem with my students|sd|2040
A|but I noticed my, my brother, who was quite a bit younger, was learning Spanish in elementary school|sd|2040
A|and he can't speak a word.|sd|2040
B|Um.|b|2040
A|And so, obviously it didn't work in California.|sd|2040
B|Yeah,|b|2040
B|but I'm rather in favor of people being bilingual,|sv|2040
A|Right.|b|2040
B|and I'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language.|sd|2040
A|Right.|b|2040
B|But I'm, I'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level.|sv|2040
A|Oh, I see.|ba|2040
B|Um, I'm, I'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness I guess.|sd|2040
A|Uh-huh,|b|2040
A|uh-huh.|b|2040
B|Well I think we have gone to time|sd|2040
B|and I appreciate your having called.|fc|2040
A|Okay,|fc|2040
A|well thank you very much.|fc|2040
B|Good-bye.|fc|2040
A|Bye,|fc|2040
A|bye.|fc|2040
