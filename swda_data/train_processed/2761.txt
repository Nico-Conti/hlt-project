A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|2761
A|what are your suggestions in making a family reunion successful|qw|2761
B|Have a big family, I guess,|sv|2761
B|that's a start.|sv|2761
A|Well I guess so.|aa|2761
A|Have you had any in the|qy|2761
A|well how old are you?|qw|2761
B|Twenty-five,|sd|2761
B|so,|%|2761
A|Okay|bk|2761
A|so you  you have been to some family reunions, perhaps.|qy^d|2761
B|I just got married.|sd|2761
B|Right,|na|2761
B|every four years on one side of my family they plan on having, uh, like my grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids.|sd|2761
A|Now how long in advance do they, uh, let them know?|qw|2761
B|Well, we plan on it,|arp_nd|2761
B|it's like the third weekend in August,|sd|2761
A|Uh-huh.|bk|2761
B|so it's every four years|sd|2761
B|and so,|%|2761
A|So they all know it.|bf|2761
B|Yeah|aa|2761
B|and then, you know, arrangements are made like during the Summer for you know, um, food and who's, who's staying where, because a lot of people are from down here, in Texas.|sd|2761
A|Uh-huh,|b|2761
A|uh-huh.|b|2761
B|And, uh, a lot of my family is in Indiana.|sd|2761
B|That's where I'm originally from.|sd|2761
A|Yes.|b|2761
B|So, um, we usually meet like at my uncle's cottage in the, um, at the lake and, uh, make a couple days of it.|sd|2761
A|Well that sounds like fun,|ba|2761
A|do they all have the small children too, that come?|qy|2761
B|Yeah,|ny|2761
B|pretty much.|sd|2761
A|So all ages.|qy^d|2761
B|Yeah|ny|2761
B|and, uh, you know, there's some my age|sd|2761
B|and then there are some a lot younger, an, about four generations, I guess.|sd|2761
A|Well my husband has, uh, on one side has an extended family,|sd|2761
B|Uh-huh.|b|2761
A|and they don't ever plan it as, like you do.|sd|2761
B|Uh-huh|b|2761
A|I think if you can count on it every four years then people have it in mind|sv|2761
A|so they have to start talking about it, or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody,  because they're rather socially active too.|sd|2761
B|Uh-huh.|b|2761
B|Yeah.|b|2761
A|And so it has, it seems by doing it about six months ahead, they can pretty much get everybody there.|sd|2761
A|If they don't, you know, they'll say, oh we're planning to go so and so that, go to, to a certain place that weekend with somebody else|sd|2761
A|and we're already locked in|^q|2761
A|but six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them.|sd|2761
B|Uh-huh.|b|2761
A|My family, uh, my parents are the youngest of very large families.|sd|2761
B|Oh.|b|2761
A|Therefore, they don't have many people left.|sd|2761
B|Yeah.|b|2761
A|And, uh, the few previous ones I've had, uh,|sd|2761
A|I haven't known many of those people,|sd|2761
A|but, uh, in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family|sd|2761
A|and that's been very nice,|sd|2761
A|with, uh,|%|2761
A|I have one sister,  and three brothers|sd|2761
B|Uh-huh.|b|2761
A|and they're only three out of five of us who have children.|sd|2761
B|Oh.|b|2761
A|So, uh, we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other.|sd|2761
B|Yeah.|b|2761
A|And that's kind of nice because my husband's family reunions are so large,|sd|2761
B|Uh-huh.|b|2761
A|and they don't see each other very often,|sd|2761
A|we don't really know many of them.|sd|2761
B|Yeah,|b|2761
B|that's kind of bad.|ba|2761
A|It really is,|aa|2761
A|they're fun,|sd|2761
A|they're a lot of fun,|sd|2761
B|Yeah.|b|2761
A|but, uh, still, uh, they're not done on a regular basis|sd|2761
A|and, uh, you kind of forget what happened, and who they were from the time before.|sv|2761
B|Yeah,|aa|2761
B|it's, it's fun getting together with immediate family.|sv|2761
B|A lot of my cousins are real close|sd|2761
B|and we always get together during holidays and weddings and stuff like that,|sd|2761
B|so.|%|2761
A|Uh, those are the ones that are in Texas?|qy|2761
B|Uh, no,|nn|2761
A|Or you go to Indiana on that?|qrr|2761
B|the ones in Indiana,|na|2761
B|uh-huh.|ny|2761
A|Uh-huh,|b^m|2761
A|where in Indiana?|qw|2761
B|Lafayette.|sd|2761
A|Lafayette, I don't know where,|qw^d|2761
A|I used to live in Indianapolis.|sd|2761
B|Yeah,|b|2761
B|it's a little north of Indianapolis, about an hour.|sd|2761
A|Yeah,|b|2761
A|yeah,|b|2761
A|it's very pretty country in there I think,|sv|2761
A|it's gorgeous.|sv|2761
B|Uh-huh,|aa|2761
B|so.|%|2761
A|Well I,|%|2761
A|uh, when is your next one, uh, scheduled now.|qw|2761
B|Well it's like, the last one was my high school graduation|sd|2761
B|the next one was when I graduated from college,|sd|2761
B|so I guess about two more years.|sd|2761
A|Yes, well,|b|2761
A|and do you think you'll have a baby to take back with you|qy|2761
B|Uh, maybe,|no|2761
B|I don't know,|no|2761
A|Maybe|b^m|2761
B|two more years,|sd|2761
B|I don't know,|no|2761
B|probably.|na|2761
A|I mean you need another milestone, you know.|sv|2761
B|Yeah,|aa|2761
B|I guess that's, that's what,|%|2761
B|I mean I've been married now for about nine months|sd|2761
B|so that was another milestone, I guess|sv|2761
A|Yes,|aa|2761
A|well I'm sure,|aa|2761
A|and then all of your family probably has not met your husband.|qy^d|2761
B|Um, yeah,|b|2761
B|he's from Indiana,|^h|2761
A|Oh, is he?|bh|2761
B|so they all met,|sd|2761

A|But I got off that.|sd|2761
B|Well we've kind of exhausted everything I guess.|fc|2761
