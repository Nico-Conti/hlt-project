B|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3120
A|Okay|b|3120
B|Well, did you go to college?|qy|3120
A|Yes,|ny|3120
A|I did.|sd|3120
B|And where did you go?|qw|3120
A|I went to a small liberal arts college in Virginia.|sd|3120
B|Uh-huh.|b|3120
A|Uh, it was Sweeper College of about seven hundred and fifty students.|sd|3120
A|I had gone to a small school growing up, uh,|sd|3120
A|and a lot of my friends went to University of Michigan|sd|3120
A|but my parents were retiring in South Carolina when I graduated and, uh, were looking for a southern school and, uh, also U of M seemed overwhelming in size|sd|3120
B|Uh-huh.|b|3120
A|and, uh, what about you?|qo|3120
B|I went to the University of Minnesota.|sd|3120
A|Oh, so you're from the Midwest, too.|bf|3120
B|I am,|aa|3120
B|uh-huh.|aa|3120
B|Where do you live now?|qw|3120
A|Uh, I live in Texas now.|sd|3120
A|Where are you?|qw|3120
B|Well, I'm in Texas.|sd|3120
B|I'm in Austin.|sd|3120
A|Oh, uh, my brother's in Austin.|sd|3120
A|Uh, he lives Lakeway.|sd|3120
A|He, uh, had moved, uh,|sd|3120
A|we're in Plano.|sd|3120
B|Uh-huh.|b|3120
A|And,|%|3120
B|I'm familiar with Plano.|sd|3120
B|I visited once or twice.|sd|3120
A|Oh, Austin is so pretty.|sv|3120
A|I really like it|sd|3120
B|Oh, I love it.|sd|3120
B|I love it.|sd|3120
B|I really do.|sd|3120
A|And your daughter is going to be a sophomore.|bf|3120
B|That's correct.|aa|3120
B|I have two daughters,|sd|3120
B|but my oldest will be, will be a sophomore.|sd|3120
A|Is, uh, because you live in Austin, is she thinking about the University of Texas?|qy|3120
B|She has her heart set on U T.|na|3120
B|And, uh, you know, having gone to the University of Minnesota, I know what a big university is like.|sd|3120
B|And, uh, one thing that I did this summer, which I thought might benefit both my daughters is, my youngest daughter got involved in band,|sd|3120
B|and Baylor has a band camp.|sd|3120
A|Oh.|b|3120
B|So she went for a week,|sd|3120
B|and it was overnight,|sd|3120
B|and they lived in the dorms.|sd|3120
B|And I thought this would expose both of them to what it's, you know, like on a a smaller college campus.|sd|3120
B|And, uh, my oldest one just wasn't impressed at all with the idea of a small school.|sd|3120
B|So, uh, I, I, I still think the exposure was good.|sd|3120
A|Yes.|b|3120
B|The reason I ask if you went to college is I thought, well, you know,|sd|3120
B|what were your selection criteria.|qw|3120
B|Did you base it on what you wanted to major in or what you would feel comfortable with or what you could afford|qy|3120
B|or, you know, there's all of these areas to look at in making the decision.|sd|3120
A|Uh-huh.|aa|3120
A|Those, and those were several, uh, that we did consider.|sd|3120
A|Uh, my parents, uh, certainly didn't push but wanted me to look in the south|sd|3120
A|and because I had been in a small school, they suggested that I probably, I,|sd|3120
A|when I say small, my graduating class had eighteen in it.|sd|3120
B|Oh, wow.|ba|3120
A|And so they suggested that I might want a smaller school because I was used to a lot of one-on-one uh, or small group situations.|sd|3120
B|Oh, definitely.|aa|3120
A|And I did pick it because at the time I was interested in majoring in biology|sd|3120
A|and I also wanted to spend one year studying in Europe.|sd|3120
B|Uh-huh.|b|3120
A|Uh, I had had an A F S student from Germany live with us our senior year|sd|3120
B|Oh, how exciting.|ba|3120
A|and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing|sd|3120
A|and I ended up majoring in French.|sd|3120
A|One of the reasons I picked the school was because they had a strong science department.|sd|3120
A|They also had a strong language department|sd|3120
A|and I'd always loved working with children.|sd|3120
A|Uh, and I found that I couldn't fit everything in,|sd|3120
A|but because I had had a fair amount of French going in I was able to do my year's study in France and able to take a lot of the other courses that interested me.|sd|3120
B|Uh-huh.|b|3120
A|Uh, and so that was some of,|sd|3120
B|Oh, that was, That worked out very well for you.|bf|3120
A|but|%|3120
A|several of the things you mentioned were the things that, uh, our son has talked a lot about Texas A and M.|sd|3120
A|He, but he thinks he wants to be a writer|sd|3120
A|and I don't think that,|sd|3120
B|Well, then he should come to U T.|sv|3120
A|Yes|b|3120
A|Uh, and really his, his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand.|sd|3120
B|Uh-huh.|b|3120
A|Uh, and so he's used to a bigger size|sd|3120
B|Large classes.|bf|3120
A|and because my brother is there, uh, he would have family, close by.|sd|3120
A|So there, there are advantages. Uh,|sd|3120
A|but I also,|%|3120
A|because I had so many friends who did go from our small school to University of Michigan, which was so large|sd|3120
A|and they really felt, uh, like they were numbers.|sd|3120
B|Oh, I went from a large high school to a large university|sd|3120
B|and I definitely felt like I was a number.|sd|3120
A|You still,|%|3120
A|Yeah.|b|3120
B|Uh, I mean, it is a different feeling.|sd|3120
B|But that was, that was my only option.|sd|3120
B|I, I mean, I just really couldn't look at anything else.|sd|3120
B|That was the one and only thing I could really afford other than a you know, a junior college, which I didn't want to do.|sd|3120
B|So that's how, you know, my decision was made.|sd|3120
B|But, uh,|%|3120
A|Well, that's certainly,|%|3120
A|uh, especially today with the cost of college.|sd|3120
A|I mean that is a, a major, uh, consideration|sv|3120
A|and I do feel fortunate that Texas has so many good schools.|sd|3120
A|And even though Baylor, uh,|sd|3120
B|Yes.|b|3120
A|and when you mentioned that, we, we have friends who have children there who just love it.|sd|3120
A|And for a private school it is not as expensive as most are|sd|3120
A|and it is a smaller size|sd|3120
A|and, uh, I do feel like there are a lot of options.|sd|3120
A|It's, it's,|%|3120
A|but I had been hoping some schools I know give, uh, oh,|sd|3120
A|even this year, Jay had an aptitude test, uh,|sd|3120
B|What, what does,|qw|3120
B|he hopes to be a writer.|qy^d|3120
A|Yes,|ny|3120
A|he thinks that's what he'd like to do,|sd|3120
A|but he's really strong in math and science, too,|sd|3120
A|and we keep encouraging him to keep an open mind.|sd|3120
B|Huh.|%|3120
A|Does your daughter know what she'd like to do?|qy|3120
B|Oh, she, she has, uh, you know, interests that are just, you know, going in all directions.|sd|3120
A|Yeah.|b|3120
B|Uh, what she talks about a lot is theater which I think is|sd|3120
B|okay Bethany, let's be real|^q|3120
B|Uh, she really is, is pretty unfocussed at this point.|sd|3120
B|And, I don't know,|h|3120
B|she's taken a lot of French,|sd|3120
B|and she may end up doing something with that.|sd|3120
B|And I am a single mom,|sd|3120
B|so I've been,|sd|3120
B|and I made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married.|sd|3120
B|So I'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake.|sd|3120
B|And I'm, you know, showing them if you're strong in math and science, kiddos, this is one area where women can make some decent money. You know.|sd|3120
A|Yes.|b|3120
B|I mean, I'm kind of really putting the practical application, you know, and, and saying, yet, do something that you enjoy.|sd|3120
A|Uh-huh.|b|3120
B|By all means, go get that piece of paper, you know.|^q|3120
B|Do you just have one son?|qy|3120
A|Yes.|ny|3120
B|I see.|bk|3120
B|Well, it sounds like he's got some really, you know, good strong ideas of what he wants to do.|sv|3120
A|Well, he, but he has even,|sd|3120
A|now that he's in high school, uh,|sd|3120
A|and, of course, there's, there is still time,|sd|3120
A|but he's beginning to feel that, as much as he enjoys writing, he wonders if he can make a living at it.|sd|3120
A|You know, it's, the, it's,|%|3120
