A|Well, that's nice.|ba|2244
B|So, what kind of cooking do you do up there?|qw|2244
A|Oh, well, basically, um, because I lived in the Middle East for a while I tend to fix Middle Eastern foods when I have, have people over.|sd|2244
A|And so, um, some of the dips are like chick peas mashed with, um, sesame.|sd|2244
B|Uh-huh.|b|2244

B|Uh-huh.|b|2244
A|Or another dip is made with, very similar but with, um, eggplant which has been actually|sd|2244
A|it ends up with a barbecued taste.|sd|2244
A|I,|%|2244
A|although we usually bake it in the oven|sd|2244
A|or if we have, uh,|%|2244
A|those of us that have gas stoves bake it on top just like putting it in the gas flame and sort of getting it black, on the outside but mushy on the inside.|sd|2244
B|Oh.|b|2244
B|Oh, that's unusual I'd never heard of anything like that, you know.|sd|2244
B|Here in Texas it's all, you know, Tex-Mex cooking and barbecue|sd|2244
