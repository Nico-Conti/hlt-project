A|Do you, uh, have a family budget,|qy|3813
A|or, how do you work your budgeting?|qrr|3813
B|Well, for many, many years, uh, my wife and I did have a budget.|sd|3813
B|Uh, we were both working at the time and so forth|sd|3813
B|and, uh, that,|%|3813
B|we had to do that until we finally got the house paid for and, and other big bills taken care of.|sd|3813
A|Uh-huh.|b|3813
B|Uh, we have a, a budget,|sd|3813
B|but not as strict now as we used to because we don't have quite such a tight financial situation.|sd|3813
A|Yeah.|b|3813
B|So it, it's, uh, it's helpful.|sd|3813
B|I mean, yes,|ny|3813
B|having a budget is very, very important|sd|3813
B|and that did get us so that, you know, the house is paid for and, uh, other major things are taken care of|sd|3813
B|and now we can relax a little bit more because basically we don't really require as much on a daily or a monthly basis as we did before,|sd|3813
B|so we don't have to have quite as strict, uh, a budget as we did.|sd|3813
A|Oh, well, we don't have a real strict budget.|sd|3813
A|Uh, we have a, a low budget to work on,|sd|3813
A|but we, uh, you know,|%|3813
A|for like groceries, we say about this much per week|sd|3813
A|and then we just spend about so much.|sd|3813
B|Sure,|b|3813
B|uh-huh.|b|3813
A|We don't, I, I don't know of a written figure of expenses that we, you know, keep to or anything,|sd|3813
A|but I know that I go to the grocery store that we always stick within, you know, five dollars between here and there.|sd|3813
B|Uh-huh.|b|3813
A|A certain amount.|sd|3813
B|I think I've, I do that automatically myself.|sd|3813
A|Yeah.|b|3813
B|I mean, I unconsciously, uh, you know, stay in a, within a, with a certain amount because I, I have enough food already stored here that I don't have to make any large purchase at any one time.|sd|3813
A|Oh.|b|3813
B|All I normally do now is pick up little things here and there. If the salt goes out or we need sugar or something like that.|sd|3813
A|Wow,|ba|3813
A|that's great.|ba|3813
B|Yeah,|b|3813
B|we have two freezers,|sd|3813
B|and, course, we have a large garden here that we grow a lot of our own stuff|sd|3813
B|and we freeze a lot of that,|sd|3813
B|so a lot of the vegetables are taken care of in our own personal storage.|sd|3813
A|Oh.|b|3813
A|Oh, you guys sound pretty self sufficient|sv|3813
B|Well, we, we keep a little note pad on a, on a wall.|sd|3813
B|if anything is absolutely out, make a note of it|sd|3813
B|and then, uh, the next time I go to the store, why, I pick it up and fill it up.|sd|3813
A|Huh.|b|3813
B|So it's, it's worked very well that way.|sd|3813
B|That way we you know, if each of us finds something is missing, uh, we put it up.|sd|3813
B|Uh, the other person might not know about it.|sd|3813
A|Yeah.|b|3813
B|That way we keep up to date|sd|3813
A|Well, that's a good idea.|ba|3813
A|Let's see,|^h|3813
A|the other thing there the topic was talking about was, if, if, uh,|sd|3813
A|all I can think of is if you don't keep a real, a real tight budget, how do you control expenses,|qh|3813
A|but, uh, one,|%|3813
A|another thing that we do is we always fly back to California and Washington each Christmas.|sd|3813
A|Well, not fly back,|sd|3813
A|but somehow we get back there.|sd|3813
B|Uh-huh.|b|3813
A|And, uh, this year we did it by train because it was the least expensive|sd|3813
A|and,|%|3813
B|Well, actually, it's more interesting, too, if you've got the time.|sd|3813
A|Huh?|br|3813
A|Oh, yeah.|b|3813
A|And, uh, you know, we could go to both places without having to spend so much for plane fare.|sd|3813
B|Yeah.|b|3813
B|Sure.|b|3813
B|Well, I think we unconsciously do the same thing.|sd|3813
B|Excuse me, my throat's not as clear today as it should be.|fa|3813
A|Uh-huh,|b|3813
A|that's all right.|bd|3813
B|Uh, we are, uh, going to be traveling to Europe with a choral.|sd|3813
B|We sing with a so called Pennsylvania choral|sd|3813
A|Uh-huh.|b|3813
B|and we make a two weeks tour of, of, uh, foreign countries|sd|3813
B|and, of course, that costs money.|sd|3813
B|So we, uh,|%|3813
B|each of us watches the funds that we spend and make sure that, that we gather together over a period a time enough money to, to make this trip.|sd|3813
B|So that is another way of, uh, budgeting|sd|3813
A|Uh-huh,|aa|3813
A|that's right.|aa|3813
B|and I think we just sort of unconsciously do it.|sd|3813
B|We, uh, just live a normal life,|sd|3813
B|but we don't throw any money away, particularly.|sd|3813
B|We save it for this trip, which is, uh, always very, very nice.|sd|3813
A|Yeah,|b|3813
A|well, whenever|%|3813
A|I don't know if this is part of the topic,|sd|3813
A|but whenever I find, you know, a dime or something on the ground, I, I'll probably pick it up|sd|3813
B|I do the same thing.|aa|3813
B|I have a whole pile of them saved that I have found by parking meters|sd|3813
A|Uh-huh,|b|3813
A|yeah,|%|3813
A|I have a special little jar that I keep all the money I found in.|sd|3813
A|You know, just count it up at the end of the year, something.|sd|3813
B|Yeah.|b|3813
B|Yeah|b|3813
A|But, yeah.|b|3813
B|Well, let's face it,|ad|3813
B|the, when we're talking budget, it is important to, to have a budget|sv|3813
B|and, uh, I, I keep track of mine on a more rough basis now by just watching the level of my checking account|sd|3813
B|and I have a money market account also.|sd|3813
A|Uh-huh.|b|3813
B|And, uh, I keep those levels up above a certain minimum,|sd|3813
B|and I'm always trying to,|sd|3813
