A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|2466
B|Okay,|b^m|2466
B|that made a nice ugly sound.|sv|2466
B|So,|%|2466
A|Your name is Lynn?|qy|2466
B|Linda.|ng|2466
A|Linda.|b^m|2466
B|Uh-huh.|b|2466
B|So, sounds like you like to read.|bf|2466
A|Yeah,|aa|2466
A|I read quite a bit, probably don't read as much as I would like to.|sd|2466
B|I don't read as much as I would like to either.|sd|2466
B|I'm, I'm a single mom,|sd|2466
B|but I have always loved reading.|sd|2466
A|Uh-huh.|b|2466
B|What do you like to read?|qo|2466
A|Um, well um, I'm a, I'm a counselor, a therapist by trade,|^h|2466
A|so most of my books are, um, I guess what you'd call self improvement type of books.|sd|2466
B|That what I've been reading lately a lot of.|sd|2466
B|Um, my interests switch around dramatically.|sd|2466
B|I used to read just, mainly fiction,|sd|2466
B|and now I, like a said, I've read a lot of self, self help books.|sd|2466
A|Uh-huh.|b|2466
A|What kind of things have you read?|qw|2466
B|Oh, I read all kinds of things for, um, helping people survive a divorce.|sd|2466
A|Uh-huh.|b|2466
B|Uh, THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED was probably one of my favorites.|sd|2466
B|Have you read that?|qy|2466
A|Uh, I haven't gotten through it yet.|ng|2466
B|You haven't?|bh|2466
A|No.|nn|2466
B|Okay,|b|2466
B|what would you recommend?|qw|2466
A|Um, as far as dealing with divorce?|qy|2466
B|Oh, I'm kind of getting that one past me, but a good self help book.|ng|2466
A|Good self help.|b|2466
B|Yeah.|b|2466
A|Well, um probably the best one that I, I know of and I work with all the time is called SEARCH FOR SIGNIFICANCE by Robert McGee|sd|2466
B|Um, that sounds good.|ba|2466
B|Uh-huh.|b|2466
A|and it's one that we use in our work.|sd|2466
A|It's probably one you'd find in like a Christian book store.|sd|2466
A|I don't know what the chains are down there. Maybe in the mall family book store, something like that.|sd|2466
B|Uh-huh.|b|2466
B|I'm writing it down.|sd|2466
B|That does that's sound really good.|ba|2466
B|Um, what kind of counseling do you do,|qw|2466
B|or should we stay on the topic of books?|qy|2466
A|Um, probably should stay on the topic,|na|2466
A|but that has a little bit to do with some of the things that I read|sd|2466
A|I'm a therapist for Rossa.|sd|2466
A|It's a Christian treatment organization|sd|2466
B|Oh.|bk|2466
A|and because of that I see, uh, work with adolescents specifically,|sd|2466
A|so I see a lot of kids with, with various problems.|sd|2466
A|Right now some of the things I'm working with are kids that are dealing with sexual abuse,|sd|2466
A|so a lot of the books I've been reading have to do with helping them get through those issues.|sd|2466
B|Oh, I would imagine helping them feel good about themselves|sv|2466
B|they're at a bad stage anyway,|sv|2466
B|and then to have to deal with sexual abuse would be terrible, as a teen.|sv|2466
A|Uh-huh.|b|2466
B|That's, uh, that must be a wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to make a contribution like that.|qy^d|2466
A|Well, sometimes it's rewarding,|arp_nd|2466
A|and, and sometimes it's a struggle.|arp_nd|2466
B|Oh, I'm sure,|ba|2466
B|I'm sure.|ba|2466
B|Uh, what|%|2466
B|is, is that just the only type of reading you've been doing,|qy|2466
B|or do you, have you read any good novels lately?|qrr|2466
A|Um, I guess I've got so many books like that that I need to read|sd|2466
A|it's, it's hard for me to do a lot of, uh, reading, yeah, reading just for enjoyment.|sd|2466
B|just joy reading.|^2|2466
B|Yeah.|%|2466
B|I hear you there,|ba|2466
B|that's for sure. Um,|ba|2466
A|In fact,|%|2466
B|I guess, the last book I've read,|sd|2466
B|my oldest daughter had to read LOST HORIZONS for her English class,|sd|2466
A|Uh-huh.|b|2466
B|And I just realized I had never read it growing up.|sd|2466
B|So, I just finished reading that for enjoyment.|sd|2466
A|Um, that's neat.|ba|2466
B|And it it was good.|sd|2466
B|Um, she, she's not, didn't enjoy it much,|sd|2466
B|so I didn't get much satisfaction trying to discuss it with her.|sd|2466
B|But I thought it was real interesting.|sd|2466
A|Yeah,|b|2466
A|I've always wanted to go back and read some of my literature texts from college um, because I enjoyed some of those stories so much,|sd|2466
B|Uh-huh.|b|2466
A|but I never seem to have the time to do that kind of reading.|sd|2466
B|I know.|aa|2466
B|Yeah.|b|2466
B|Um, I trying to think of some of my other favorite books,|^h|2466
B|but, I, I keep lists,|sd|2466
B|I must have a list of, oh, two hundred, three hundred books that I want to read.|sd|2466
A|Uh-huh.|b|2466
B|Just like, I want to read that and I write it down.|sd|2466
A|Yeah,|b|2466
A|I've got a stack next to my bed|sd|2466
B|So do I.|sd|2466
A|I tend to get a little bit of ways in a book|sd|2466
A|and then I, I get distracted, and, or have to start on another one,|sd|2466
A|it's pretty tough to keep up with.|sv|2466
A|I was trying to think of,|sd|2466
A|I, I've got a copy of THE ROAD LESS TRAVELLED|sd|2466
A|but I was trying to think, there's another Scott book that I've got that I had read.|sd|2466
B|Uh, He, he also wrote PEOPLE OF THE LIE.|sd|2466
A|Yeah,|b|2466
A|that's the one I was thinking of.|sd|2466
B|Yeah.|b|2466
B|I, I bought that one,|sd|2466
B|and I didn't get into, involved in that one as well.|sd|2466
B|There's another one he wrote that even sounds better,|sv|2466
B|and it's kind of the whole concept of global peace, you know, like, and communities building communities.|sd|2466
A|Uh-huh.|b|2466
B|Someone just recently said something really neat about that.|sd|2466
B|Uh, I got involved in, uh, Beginning Experience Weekends,|sd|2466
B|and, uh, it was of the people from there that said that.|sd|2466
B|His latest book, and I can't recall the name of it, is just excellent,|sd|2466
B|and his whole idea is, we can build a better world if people get involved in good community building projects.|sd|2466
B|And he did, uh, mention Beginning Experience Weekends as one of the, you know, one of the places.|sd|2466
A|Uh.|b|2466
B|So, I've um,|%|2466
A|That's interesting.|ba|2466
B|Yeah,|aa|2466
B|it, it really was.|aa|2466
B|A real fun bunch of books that I read, uh, the beginning of last year were, um, the author of JONATHAN, JONATHAN LIVINGSTON SEAGULL|sd|2466
A|Uh-huh.|b|2466
B|I can't think of his name.|sd|2466
A|Is it ?|qy|2466
B|Pardon me|br|2466
A|?|qy|2466
B|uh, no, uh, oh,|nn|2466
B|it'll, it'll come to me,|sd|2466
B|but he wrote, he wrote the ILLUSION, and A BRIDGE OVER A BRIDGE TO FOREVER.|sd|2466
B|Those are mind expanding books|sv|2466
A|Um.|b|2466
B|His concepts are so different than what I would have ever dreamed of.|sd|2466
B|I can't think of what his name is right, right off the bat, though.|sd|2466
B|But, uh, they, they were fun.|sd|2466
B|They were real just books for fun.|sd|2466
A|Uh-huh|b|2466
B|Have you been involved on the Switchboard long?|qy|2466
A|Um, not very long.|ng|2466
A|I really just started.|sd|2466
B|Uh-huh.|b|2466
B|How did you get involved?|qw|2466
A|My wife has been working for T I.|sd|2466
B|Oh, I see.|bk|2466
B|I'm a former T I-er.|sd|2466
B|I just recently quit.|sd|2466
B|And so, uh, I got myself involved in a sales job,|sd|2466
B|and right now, my list of books to be read have to do with, uh, the art of selling.|sd|2466
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b|2466
B|So.|%|2466
A|It's just, I was just thinking, at, at Rossa|sd|2466
A|they tend to come out with a new book every couple of weeks just to help us deal with all the things that we have to deal with.|sd|2466
B|Uh-huh.|b|2466
A|So, I keep getting stacks of books I need to read,|sd|2466
A|and, I don't know when I'm going to get to them all.|sd|2466
B|Never,|sv|2466
B|never|sv|2466
B|there's never going to be enough hours in the day.|sv|2466
A|I don't think so.|aa|2466
B|Even if you took speed reading. Huh.|sv|2466
A|Yeah,|aa|2466
A|I don't think so.|aa|2466
B|So, well, I'm trying to think of what other kind.|^h|2466
B|Do you like to read mysteries.|qy|2466
A|Yeah,|ny|2466
A|a little bit.|sd|2466
B|Do you like Ken ?|qy|2466
A|Um. Trying to think.|^h|2466
B|He writes, uh, spy novels, THE EYE OF THE NEEDLE|sd|2466
A|Uh-huh.|b|2466
B|and, uh, I've, I've really, I really have found his books enjoyable|sd|2466
A|I like that kind of stuff.|sd|2466
A|I think the last novel I read I read, I guess, in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year.|sd|2466
A|It was a, um, last name's ,|sd|2466
A|it's called PIERCING, no, it's called THIS PRESENT DARKNESS.|sd|2466
B|Um.|b|2466
A|It's, uh, kind of unusual book.|sd|2466
A|It's a lot about spiritual warfare and some things like that.|sd|2466
B|Oh that sounds interesting.|ba|2466
B|like phone knocking against It sounds really good.|sv|2466
B|Hey, you should make yourself a promise that you'll, you'll read one novel in the next six months, just for you.|ad|2466
A|Uh-huh.|aa|2466
B|You know, it's, it's so easy to get caught up on reading just for your work, or, you know, self improvement,|sv|2466
B|and you kind of forget the fun of reading|sv|2466
A|Yeah,|aa|2466
A|that's true.|aa|2466
B|Yeah,|b|2466
B|very easily.|sv|2466
B|So|%|2466
A|Well, I guess we've covered the topic pretty thoroughly.|sv|2466
B|I think so, too.|aa|2466
B|And I thank you for calling.|fc|2466
