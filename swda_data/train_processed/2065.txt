A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|2065
A|The question was, um, what, what is your opinion of youth, uh, spending a year or two in, in public service.|sd|2065
B|I think it would be a great idea.|sv|2065
B|I'm not sure about requiring it, you know, of people, because people are going, you know, feeling resentful.|sv|2065
B|I don't know,|h|2065
B|but I think it would be a great idea.|sv|2065
A|Yeah.|b|2065
B|Seems like there's so many kids that don't have any since of, you know, what they want to be or do|sv|2065
B|or, you know, they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time|sv|2065
B|and we, sure, our country, all countries sure need help|sv|2065
B|so,|%|2065
A|Huh-uh.|b|2065
A|Would, uh, would you be more in favor of, uh, you know, like a local, uh,|qy|2065
A|my only experience with it, I was in Central America for a while, and, uh, in San Salvador, in El Salvador,|sd|2065
B|Huh-uh.|b|2065
B|Huh-uh.|b|2065
A|For instance, everybody had what they called there social year, that they had to put in|sd|2065
B|Oh, really.|b|2065
A|and basically it was a, uh, repayment for, for, uh, high school education,|sd|2065
B|Huh-uh.|b|2065
A|and most of them joined the Red Cross|sd|2065
A|and it was done internally.|sd|2065
A|I just,|%|2065
A|there was very little external.|sd|2065
A|I think possibly what, uh, they're thinking about here, more external Peace Corps, Type things where we're sending people off shore.|sv|2065
B|Yeah.|b|2065
B|Well, I think that would be real interesting for people to do,|sv|2065
B|but, I guess, my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them, you know, to other countries,|sv|2065
A|Huh-uh.|b|2065
B|and, but, I don't know.|h|2065
B|If you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe countries that are so poor that they wouldn't be able to really, you know, send children to do that.|sv|2065
A|Yeah.|b|2065
B|I didn't know.|sd|2065
A|I don't, I don't know how the Peace Corps works,|sd|2065
A|I, guess I was of age when the Peace Corps came in, and all that.|sd|2065
B|Yeah,|b|2065
B|I was too.|sd|2065
B|I thought seriously about joining at that time,|sd|2065
B|I thought it was a fantastic idea.|sv|2065
A|Did you ever get any information on it like,|qy|2065
B|I sent off for stuff on it,|sd|2065
B|but I don't remember that much. about it.|sd|2065
B|I know that they trained you in the language|sd|2065
B|and, um,|%|2065
A|That's what I was wondering about was whether they actually,|sd|2065
B|You actually got paid too, while in the Peace Corps,|sd|2065
B|it wasn't much,|sv|2065
A|Yeah.|b|2065
B|but I guess, they, you could put some money aside while you were there, your expenses and,|sv|2065
A|Wasn't Jimmy Carter's mama that was in the Peace Corps?|qy|2065
B|Yeah,|ny|2065
B|I think so,|sv|2065
B|yeah,|ny|2065
B|yeah|ny|2065
B|But it might be interesting to see what would happen if you took kids at a, and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex and everything here, and take them to some other country that had different moral values like Saudi Arabia where they couldn't drink|sv|2065
A|Where they couldn't do that.|bf|2065
A|Yeah,|%|2065
A|you might end up with a revolution.|sv|2065
A|I don't know which end though.|sv|2065
B|Really|b|2065
A|Yeah,|b|2065
A|yeah.|b|2065
A|That's, that's been interesting, though, the kids that have been over, you know, coming back right now, you know.|sv|2065
B|Yeah.|b|2065
A|You wonder if being exposed to that for a while, what percentage of them would actually say, Hey, that's not a bad way to do it,|sv|2065
A|because from what I understand, from some of the guys I know, you know, crime, uh, is punishable, just almost, uh, instantly and public,|sv|2065
B|Public hanging.|^2|2065
A|yeah.|aa|2065
A|Public hanging and this sort of thing, you know,|sd|2065
A|so you don't have just a whole lot of, what we consider street crimes.|sv|2065
B|Yeah.|b|2065
B|Yeah.|b|2065
B|I've heard that like in China and stuff, there is virtually no such thing as rape, because if you rape somebody you'd be murdered, you know, on the, you know, street|sv|2065
B|so,|%|2065
A|Yeah.|b|2065
A|Well, I guess that's, uh, the price of freedom, I guess, is a little, anyway,|sv|2065
A|the, uh, uh, the, the public service thing again|sd|2065
A|I, I, I guess, in my own, having had the whole three or four minutes to, you know, give it a great deal of thought, you know, Um, I, I think I agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary,|sv|2065
A|but when you do that then it becomes almost, uh, a ,|sv|2065
A|or it can be,|%|2065
B|Yeah.|b|2065
A|You know, there have,|%|2065
A|people will kind of set up their own little club,|sv|2065
B|Yeah,|aa|2065
B|that's true.|sv|2065
A|And, uh, but if, you know,|%|2065
B|People that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation, you know, like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that.|sv|2065
A|Yeah.|b|2065
B|Might not go if it was voluntary,|sv|2065
B|but I don't know how they'd enforce it,|sd|2065
B|if it was,|%|2065
A|Yeah,|b|2065
A|well, if they went AWOL, what are you going to do.|qh|2065
B|Yeah.|b|2065
A|Shoot them.|ad|2065
A|Put them in jail|ad|2065
B|I don't know.|h|2065
B|Send them over to Iraq|ad|2065
A|Yeah,|aa|2065
A|right.|aa|2065
B|Have a vacation in Iraq for a year|ad|2065
A|I know my dad always talked about, uh,|sd|2065
A|he was in C C C during, uh,|sd|2065
B|Yeah.|b|2065
A|And he was, uh, a rock rib Iowa type republican|sd|2065
A|and the only good thing he could ever say about, uh, the whole Roosevelt administration was, uh, civilian conservation corps,|sd|2065
B|Huh-uh.|b|2065
A|because he was in it.|sd|2065
A|He thought that was great.|sd|2065
B|Yeah.|b|2065
A|The rest of it was all hog wash,|sd|2065
A|but that was great.|sd|2065
B|Well, it seems like it would develop pride, you know, in people, if, if, it's in their own country.|sv|2065
B|It would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have here and develop some pride in them, if it was handled that way.|sv|2065
B|I, I,|%|2065
B|it would take quite a few people.|sv|2065
B|I think it might build jobs for people, you know, that were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that,|sv|2065
B|so maybe that part of it would be helpful too.|sv|2065
A|Yeah.|b|2065
B|I don't know.|h|2065
A|Yeah|b|2065
A|the only,|%|2065
B|Like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and mow the grass and|sd|2065
A|Well, you know that brings up the interesting subject too, you know,|sv|2065
A|what would you have, who, who, who would determine what these people do.|qw|2065
B|Yeah,|b|2065
B|yeah.|b|2065
A|You know, if, uh, you know, if it's run by the individual state.|sv|2065
A|You know like C C C was run by the army|sd|2065
A|and in effect,|%|2065
B|Huh-uh.|b|2065
A|and the only opposition to it really was that it was, you know, starting some sort of a military elitist type, you know, special corps of cadre of people and that sort of thing.|sv|2065
B|Huh-uh.|b|2065
A|And, uh, when the politics get real confusing,|sv|2065
B|Yeah,|b|2065
B|really there could be, um, some scandals involved, if, you know, it wasn't people that were really fair and you know, in a legal way or something,|sv|2065
A|Yeah.|b|2065
B|they could send all the people over to, uh, you know, one particular part of town or one particular project, that somebody had paid somebody to, you know, get supported,|sv|2065
B|or,|%|2065
A|Yeah.|b|2065
A|Well,|%|2065
A|We've gotten to the point where, you know, if, if, well, if the racial make up of the group was such and such, you know, they'd have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and, you know, That kind of thing.|sv|2065
B|Yeah.|b|2065
B|That could be a complicated too, couldn't it.|qy|2065
A|Oh, yeah.|ny|2065
B|Yeah.|b^m|2065
A|Suppose, uh, well, you know, they had a group who were construction oriented|ad|2065
A|and they went and they, they built, uh, can't think of a good example, a swimming pool, or anything, you know,|sd|2065
A|and one, you can, you can only build it in one place, you know,|sd|2065
A|and know matter where you build it, somebody else is going to scream, well, you didn't build one over here.|sv|2065
B|Yeah.|aa|2065
B|That's true.|sv|2065
B|Unfair or something,|bf|2065
B|yeah.|%|2065
A|Yeah.|ny|2065
A|I think, uh,|%|2065
A|oh, boy|ba|2065
A|It's one of those things on the surface, you know, it seems like a great idea.|sv|2065
A|It's like a joke I heard once about, uh, elephant foot soup, you know,|sd|2065
A|it's easy to do once you find a elephant foot.|sd|2065
A|It's, uh, the logistics of the thing that, uh, gets you going.|sv|2065
B|Yeah.|b|2065
B|Really.|b|2065
B|Yeah.|b|2065
B|Well, it seems like there's, there's a lot,|sv|2065
B|you don't hear much on the news about young people really, you know, wanting to do anything good or anything like that,|sv|2065
B|but you know, I'm sure that there are a lot of young people out there that really do have good hearts and are willing to help and serve and that kind of thing.|sv|2065
B|I just, I saw on the news the other night that the, uh, the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the Cosby show, Kisha Knight Pullman, was starting a,|sd|2065
B|I guess now she's practically a teenager,|sd|2065
A|Yeah.|b|2065
B|She started some type of, um, national organization for youth to volunteer to teach, tutor other kids to read and, you know, do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards, you know, helpful things,|sd|2065
B|and I know everyone like in the high schools in Dallas,|sd|2065
B|there's a couple high schools that have wanted to start like a, um, minority, you know,|sd|2065
B|I think it was in a Hispanic area,|sv|2065
B|they wanted to start like a club for the teenagers, instead of, they said, all these gangs kids could join to belong.|sd|2065
A|Huh-uh.|b|2065
B|But they didn't have anything positive the kids could be doing, helping, you know,|sd|2065
A|Yeah.|b|2065
B|so they were trying to start that out,|sd|2065
B|so if there's people out there that are willing to, you know, kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy. Gosh, we ought to use them. You know. If their willing to do it.|sv|2065
A|Yeah.|b|2065
A|Yeah,|b|2065
A|it's, it's , it's just the, you know,|%|2065
A|here you are to the logistics of the thing again, you know.|sv|2065
B|Yeah.|b|2065
A|Who's going to run it, you know,|qh|2065
A|what,|qh|2065
A|how,|qh|2065
A|oh, it's just so many|sv|2065
B|Yeah.|b|2065
A|Like, like I said at the beginning I've got so many connections with people in Central America.|sd|2065
A|My daughter-in-law is Panamanian, you know,|sd|2065
B|Huh-uh.|b|2065
A|and they have situations like, like that down there. Where they, they have, these, the social, in some sort of way,|sd|2065
B|Huh-uh.|b|2065
A|if you want to go to school outside the country, and many Salvadorians did, they'd go to school in Cornell, Iowa, of all places,|sd|2065
B|Huh-uh.|b|2065
A|and when they came back, they'd have to serve this, this year,|sd|2065
A|and it turned out to be kind of a joke,|sd|2065
A|the ones I knew, you know, always chose the Red Cross, because they didn't do anything|sd|2065
B|Oh, I see.|b|2065
A|And they had all kinds of, uh, things they could go into, agricultural, and you know, Really good stuff,|sv|2065
B|Yeah.|b|2065
A|but, uh, unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that, Red Cross, it was so many of them in it, that at any particular chance, your chance of having to do something was, it was very slim.|sd|2065
B|Yeah.|b|2065
B|Yeah.|b|2065
A|And so,|%|2065
B|Well, we, um, belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which is like the Mormon church.|sd|2065
A|Huh-uh.|b|2065
A|Huh-uh.|b|2065
B|And, um, there, there is men and also women,|sd|2065
B|women aren't nearly as frequent,|sd|2065
B|and also that have elderly couples once their kids have left, that can volunteer to go on a mission|sd|2065
B|and, um, they're all over the world.|sd|2065
B|And, its incredible logistics,|sv|2065
B|I mean, they have a training center where they teach them,|sd|2065
B|it's called the Missionary Training Center in Utah,|sd|2065
B|and they have, to be taught the language and customs and all those kinds of things,|sd|2065
A|Yeah.|b|2065
B|and then they, um, you know, go and actually live in that country for the, the, uh,|sd|2065
B|young men do it for two years and the young women for eighteen months.|sd|2065
A|Okay.|b|2065
A|Then that's, uh, kind of a private organization,|qy^d|2065
B|Right.|na|2065
A|you know, I'm, I'm familiar with,|sd|2065
A|my instructor pilot was a Mormon,|sd|2065
A|he was, he was a good construction, uh, you know, instructor pilot because he considered himself indestructible,|sv|2065
B|Oh, yeah|b|2065
B|He had a direct connection somewhere, uh|bf|2065
A|Yeah,|aa|2065
A|right|aa|2065
A|He felt that he really had an in|sd|2065
A|so, You know, things he would do with an airplane,|sd|2065
B|Yeah.|b|2065
A|but any rate that's off the subject,|sd|2065
B|Yeah.|b|2065
A|But, I,|%|2065
B|They, they don't get paid for it,|sd|2065
B|and, um, but there is funding that comes,|sd|2065
B|they're supposedly saving up on their own|sd|2065
B|and the church helps them out some,|sd|2065
A|Huh-uh.|b|2065
B|but, you know, that it is incredible, you know.|sv|2065
A|I see how they were organized in, Central and South America|sd|2065
B|Yeah.|b|2065
A|and, uh, it's, uh,|%|2065
B|Yeah.|b|2065
