B|Uh-huh,|ny|3451
B|I have got two.|sd|3451
B|One is, uh, two|sd|3451
B|and the other one's four|sd|3451
B|and, uh, this is my first year of staying home.|sd|3451
B|I've always had them in child care.|sd|3451
A|Oh, well, then you are familiar with it?|qy|3451
B|Uh-huh.|ny|3451
A|Okay,|bk|3451
A|I, uh, I have grandchildren|sd|3451
A|and I know, uh, one has gone to a, well, two of them have gone to preschool.|sd|3451
B|Uh-huh.|b|3451
A|And I know what the experience my daughter has faced with that.|sd|3451
A|Why don't you tell me what you have found.|qo|3451
B|Well, uh, the,|%|3451
B|with our second sitter, the first one didn't quite work out, there were some things going on that I wasn't really happy with|sd|3451
B|and so I felt that, that I need to move on with them|sd|3451
B|and so I found another baby-sitter|sd|3451
B|and she was wonderful|sd|3451
B|except I thought that there were too many in the home|sd|3451
B|and it just seemed like it was so hard to find, uh, really good child care.|sd|3451
B|She was wonderful,|sd|3451
B|it's just that I felt that there were too many in the home.|sd|3451
B|It was in home child care.|sd|3451
A|Okay, Okay,|b|3451
A|so it was in home child care.|sd|3451
A|You took them to someone's home?|qy^d|3451
B|Uh-huh.|ny|3451
A|Well, both times?|qy|3451
B|Uh-huh,|ny|3451
B|right.|na|3451
A|Uh-huh.|b|3451
B|And, uh, and then I worked in, in the child care centers|sd|3451
B|and I wasn't really happy with the particular one that I was working in|sd|3451
B|so I just always had a fear about, you know, child care centers.|sd|3451
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b|3451
B|And then I just decided that I was just missing a lot of their time whether they were so little|sd|3451
B|and, and I couldn't get off of work as often as I wanted to when they were ill|sd|3451
B|so I just decided it was probably best just to stay home for a while until they were a little more, uh, independent|sd|3451
B|and, uh, I could go back to work.|sd|3451
A|I know that in raising my children, uh, I was fortunate,|sd|3451
A|I didn't have to work,|sd|3451
A|we didn't necessarily have a lot of things|sd|3451
B|Yeah|b|3451
B|That's how it's going now.|sd|3451
A|But, uh, and, I know my daughter,|sd|3451
A|because she has three|sd|3451
B|Uh-huh.|b|3451
A|I mean it's so expensive.|sv|3451
B|Oh, yeah.|b|3451
A|You have to really make a lot of money.|sv|3451
B|Yeah.|b|3451
A|And I'm glad that she gets to stay home so that she can then participate with what's going on in their life.|sd|3451
B|Yeah.|b|3451
A|Uh, bosses don't always seem to understand getting off to go to Christmas programs in the middle of the day or something.|sv|3451
B|Oh, no,|aa|3451
B|yeah.|aa|3451
A|You know, and I know that one of the day cares and it's a, a well-known chain, uh, she was not at all happy with.|sd|3451
A|It was, there was too many children per person.|sd|3451
A|They were just kind of left to play,|sd|3451
A|there was no structure to,|sd|3451
A|and the middle grandson went there as a, uh, like a preschool thing.|sd|3451
B|Uh-huh.|b|3451
A|She was wanting him actually to start getting a certain amount of, of learning and training and stuff.|sd|3451
A|Not just there, you know,|sd|3451
A|so he went like, uh, I think he went, well, five mornings a week, if I remember correctly.|sd|3451
B|Wow.|ba|3451
A|And, uh, you know, and it was supposed to be a base,|sd|3451
A|you know, starting to learn the colors and, and learning to associate with children so that when he went to, you know, school and stuff,|sd|3451
B|Uh-huh.|b|3451
B|Uh-huh.|b|3451
A|and, uh, she was most unhappy with it.|sd|3451
B|Huh.|b|3451
A|There was no structure,|sd|3451
A|there was nothing to it.|sd|3451
A|You know, and, uh, she pulled him out of that one and put him in a, another one that was excellent.|sd|3451
A|It was, it was like a little kindergarten.|sd|3451
B|Uh-huh.|b|3451
A|And, uh, they had hot lunches|sd|3451
A|and, and they had classes that, you know, one class they'd do art.|sd|3451
A|They even familiarized the children with computers.|sd|3451
B|Oh.|b|3451
A|Uh, it was just, it was really a very excellent one.|sd|3451
B|Uh-huh.|b|3451
B|And how old was he?|qw|3451
A|He's now five and a half.|sd|3451
A|He's in kindergarten.|sd|3451
B|Oh.|b|3451
A|This was last year.|sd|3451
B|Uh-huh.|b|3451

B|Uh-huh.|ny|3451

A|Oh. I had, uh, I just assumed that most churches, going by, you know experience there, that, you know, that they were good.|sd|3451
B|Yeah.|b|3451
A|I I didn't know that, uh, you know,|sd|3451
B|Uh-huh.|b|3451

A|Oh, uh-huh.|b|3451
B|and, uh, I taught early childhood|sd|3451
B|and I really enjoyed it,|sd|3451
B|but it was just, it was taking a lot of my time|sd|3451
B|and I noticed I was spending less and less time with them|sd|3451
B|and it just seemed like they were sick more often|sd|3451
A|Uh-huh.|b|3451
