B|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|2086
B|in order to make the, uh, curried chicken, I just fried the chicken, until it was nice and brown, you know|sd|2086
A|Uh-huh.|b|2086
B|make sure it's nice and brown on both sides|ad|2086
B|and then you take it out of the fat|ad|2086
B|and you, you let the chicken you fried kind of drain, so that a lot of the oil comes out of it|ad|2086
A|Uh-huh.|b|2086
B|And then you, you, uh, pour most of the, all of the oil out of the pan|ad|2086
B|and you kind of clean it out|ad|2086
B|and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil and saute some, um, bell peppers and onions in, in that little bit of oil.|ad|2086
B|Maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons, let that brown, then put all of the chicken back in there.|ad|2086
B|And then you, uh, mix flour and a cup of water, maybe, uh, one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water.|ad|2086
B|Stir it real, real well.|ad|2086
A|Uh-huh.|b|2086
B|Then you, uh, pour that in there, you know, to make the gravy.|ad|2086
B|And you let it come to a boil again|ad|2086
B|and then you let it simmer|ad|2086
B|and you add, uh, about a tablespoon of, what I'm using now is Jamaican curry powder.|ad|2086
A|Oh.|b|2086
B|And that's going to, it's going to be really good|sv|2086
A|That's very spicy, too.|bf|2086
B|Yeah,|b|2086
B|it's,|%|2086
A|I mean these bell peppers and curry.|bf|2086
B|Right,|aa|2086
B|and then if you like it really hot, you can add some hot, hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff.|sd|2086
A|Oh, that sounds really good.|sv|2086
B|Yeah.|b|2086
A|Huh.|b|2086
A|I guess it was,|sd|2086
A|is this dinner time for you?|qy|2086
B|Uh, well it will be in a little while,|na|2086
B|I'm trying to get it, get it ready early.|sd|2086
A|All done in advance,|bf|2086
A|yeah.|b|2086
A|That's um, I, uh, I'm, I'm not that great a cook|sd|2086
A|but I was single until I was thirty|sd|2086
A|so I did cook a little, you know.|sd|2086
B|Oh.|b|2086
A|Uh, and I cook a little bit now.|sd|2086
A|What I like to do mostly is stir fries|sd|2086
A|and my wife normally says, oh, Tom, why, why don't you make a stir fry tonight|sd|2086
A|and so we even, we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok.|sd|2086
B|Uh-huh.|b|2086
A|And we do a lot of, um, stir fry vegetables.|sd|2086
B|What kind of wok do you have,|qw|2086
B|is it, is it a real Chinese wok.|qy|2086
A|It's, it's called a stir fry pan|sd|2086
A|and it, and it fits right on your, uh, it fits right on your burner, whether it's gas or electric|sd|2086
A|so it's, it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does.|sd|2086
B|Uh-huh.|b|2086
B|I see.|b|2086
A|And, um, normally what what we do is, um, just, you know, like two tablespoons of oil, maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular vegetable oil.|sd|2086
A|But I will use peanut, peanut oil, or things.|sd|2086
A|And then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and, um, green peppers, and, um, maybe put in a little bit of, um garlic and ginger, uh, beforehand.|sd|2086
A|That gives, uh, uh, uh, spicier flavor|sd|2086
A|and then after the stir fry is over, just mix in, um, a little bit of, uh, sometimes chicken broth, and corn starch and soy sauce|sd|2086
B|Yeah.|b|2086
A|and that sort of makes a, uh, a glaze, that sticks to the, the vegetables,|sd|2086
B|Uh-huh.|b|2086
A|I've used,|%|2086
A|you turn them over.|sd|2086
A|A lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu,|sd|2086
A|we don't put in meat, cause I guess we're, I'm not|sd|2086
B|Uh-huh.|b|2086
A|but, uh, she likes to watch all the, how much red meat and things,|sd|2086
A|so. We'll do, a lot of times vegetarian.|sd|2086
B|Yeah.|b|2086
A|But it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and, uh, carrots and celery and green peppers and, um, oh, gee, mushrooms.|sd|2086
B|Oh that's, That sounds real good except the squash,|sv|2086
A|It's, it's a pretty big|sd|2086
A|and we put that over rice.|sd|2086
B|I just don't like squash.|sd|2086
A|Oh, you don't|bf|2086
B|I never did.|sd|2086
B|My mother used to cook a whole pan full of squash|sd|2086
B|and she'd have squash and corn bread|sd|2086
A|Oh.|b|2086
B|And maybe some, she'd have chicken or something.|sd|2086
A|Uh-huh.|b|2086
B|And I'd just be,|sd|2086
A|Yeah,|b|2086
A|see, we never, in fact I never had squash growing up.|sd|2086
A|My, my wife eats more vegetables, ate more vegetable than I did growing up.|sd|2086
A|I'm, I'm from Pittsburgh|sd|2086
A|and Pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town.|sd|2086
B|Uh-huh.|b|2086
A|Yeah,|b|2086
A|recipes in Pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato.|sd|2086
B|Uh-huh.|b|2086
A|Red meat and a potato.|sd|2086
B|Oh, that sounds good.|ba|2086
B|We, we were from North Carolina|sd|2086
B|and we had a garden|sd|2086
B|and my mother would, would, uh, grow the squash|sd|2086
B|and she'd grow white potatoes and onions and cabbage and collards and all kinds of,|sd|2086
A|Oh, she had all of those types of vegetables.|bf|2086
B|Right.|aa|2086
A|See, never, no vegetables in my family.|sd|2086
B|Wow.|ba|2086
A|Yeah,|b|2086
A|it was really funny.|sd|2086
B|You wouldn't believe it, we even raised chickens|sd|2086
A|Well that was a real farm.|bf|2086
B|You ever seen anybody kill a chicken?|qy|2086
A|No,|nn|2086
A|but I, I've, I've heard stories uh,|sd|2086
A|I've heard stories.|sd|2086
B|And they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off.|sd|2086
A|Uh.|b|2086
B|And then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub|sd|2086
B|and finally it dies down,|sd|2086
B|you get just a little patter|sd|2086
B|and then it,|sd|2086
A|Oh, this is|sv|2086
A|you shouldn't be talking about this right before, while you're fixing dinner.|ad|2086
B|Getting ready to eat chicken too.|sd|2086
A|That's right,|aa|2086
A|you should be careful|ad|2086
A|That's pretty funny.|sv|2086
A|But my dad used to tell stories, you know, about the way they eat chickens|sd|2086
A|but I never, we never, we lived in the suburbs,|sd|2086
A|we, we bought everything in a grocery store.|sd|2086
B|Uh-huh.|b|2086
A|There was no,|sd|2086
A|but it was funny, you know,|sd|2086
A|it so,|%|2086
A|but when we got married, you know, a lot more vegetables, a lot more, you know, a lot of changes.|sd|2086
B|Well that's good.|ba|2086
B|A lot of people are eating healthier now a days.|sv|2086
A|I think so too,|aa|2086
B|Yeah.|b|2086
A|but we just went shopping|sd|2086
A|and we came back with, uh, with, uh, sweets, you know, chocolate covered peanuts|sd|2086
A|and uh, we came back with sweets.|sd|2086
B|Ugh.|ba|2086
A|We didn't bring all the healthy food back too.|sd|2086
B|Yeah,|b|2086
B|I'm trying to learn how to cook, um, deserts without, without all of the sweets, you know, maybe use honey or something.|sd|2086
A|Uh-huh,|b|2086
A|well that's, that's supposed to be, um, the trend of the future, but, uh, the cut back.|sd|2086
B|Yeah.|b|2086
A|I, uh, recently was over a friends house that's Indian|sd|2086
A|and, uh, she had brought Indian sweets into the office|sd|2086
A|and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots.|sd|2086

B|The spice,|bf|2086
B|yeah.|b|2086
A|It was funny, even the sweets did.|sd|2086
B|Wow.|ba|2086

A|but then after a couple of minutes you could taste it.|sd|2086
A|You know, it had that, that after taste that, very, it was a very Indian flavor.|sd|2086
B|Yeah.|b|2086
