A|Go ahead|ad|4618
B|Uh, have you every been tested for a new job or anything?|qy|4618
A|Uh, no|nn|4618
A|I haven't.|sd|4618
A|But, in my job, I'm a nurse, and we are allowed to be.|sd|4618
A|I mean, you know, this is the rules that they can do this anytime.|sd|4618
A|Uh, I don't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested.|sd|4618
B|So it's just sort of, uh,|%|4618
B|they can if they,|%|4618
A|They can if they choose to.|sd|4618
B|Oh, okay.|b|4618
A|Right.|b|4618
A|Have you, well have you had any experience with it at all?|qy|4618
B|Uh, not really|ng|4618
B|but I've always worked on a university level|sd|4618
B|but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff.|sd|4618
A|Uh-huh.|b|4618
A|So what do you think about that?|qo|4618
B|Uh, I don't, I don't think they're very accurate|sv|4618
B|because, I mean, I know their lifestyles changed prior to the drug test|sd|4618
B|and I know they changed afterwards.|sd|4618
A|Right,|aa|4618
A|right.|aa|4618
A|See I know of that too.|sd|4618
A|And I also know that things like antihistamines, Sudafeds, things like that, can really throw it off.|sd|4618
A|And you cannot get a job because of it Uh-huh.|sd|4618
B|Yeah,|b|4618
B|I, I had a friend,|sd|4618
B|it didn't cause her any problems with her job|sd|4618
B|but it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen.|sd|4618
B|But what it was, was she had been she had been, uh, in the jungle|sd|4618
B|and it was some Malaria medication|sd|4618
B|and she tested positive for that.|sd|4618
A|See, and so it really is a dangerous thing that way|sv|4618
A|because I know of somebody that tested for an airline and didn't get the job|sd|4618
A|and they weren't told why.|sd|4618
A|But a lot of people say the reason why, after you take a physical, will be because of the drug testing|sv|4618
A|or they would tell you.|sv|4618
A|Or this person never use any drugs.|sv|4618
B|See, I always,|%|4618
B|I thought they got, you got called back if you tested positive, for more tests.|sv|4618
A|Uh, you should.|sv|4618
A|Because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something.|sv|4618
A|I have real mixed feelings about it.|sd|4618
A|I don't know.|sd|4618
B|How, do you know how wrong they are?|qy|4618
B|Are they, I mean, is there a margin of error?|qy|4618
A|The accuracy?|br|4618
A|I don't know.|no|4618
A|I don't know.|no|4618
A|But, I know there are a lot of things that can influence them|sd|4618
A|and I think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time.|sv|4618
B|Yeah.|b|4618
A|And if you could show that,|sv|4618
A|I, I interviewed for a job recently|sd|4618
A|and I was taking Entex. And my doctor gave me a prescription for it.|sd|4618
B|Uh-huh.|b|4618
A|And he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive, you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you, you know.|sd|4618
A|And it didn't come up that I needed to do it|sd|4618
A|but this could happen to anybody|sv|4618
A|and if they would just say oh, this person's drug test is positive we won't hire them you know. Then you could lose out on a job when really you didn't do anything.|sv|4618
B|Yeah.|b|4618
B|Yeah.|b|4618
A|So I don't know.|h|4618
B|And I, I'm not so sure they are that needed. *b|sv|4618
A|Yeah,|aa|4618
A|I'm not  sure either.|sd|4618
A|The only way I can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it, then they have the right to go ahead and prove it|sv|4618
A|because they say they can spot check.|sd|4618
B|if you're using it while at a job, I can see a problem.|sv|4618
A|Yeah.|b|4618
B|But the occasional person, then it's almost like, it's almost an infringement of your privacy.|sv|4618
A|Well, it sort of is.|aap_am|4618
A|And this is it,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|4618
A|this,|%|4618
A|I'm not real sure how I feel about it because I can see it from two ways.|sd|4618
A|You know, as a health professional, I wouldn't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs.|sv|4618
B|Yeah.|b|4618
A|You know, so as a patient, I feel well, yeah, we probably should be protected.|sv|4618
A|But, on the other hand, there's a lot of things I should be protected from that they don't test my patients for too.|sv|4618
A|So you know, I guess you sort of, you have to have trust some place along the way.|sv|4618
B|Yeah.|b|4618
A|You can't go around testing everybody for everything.|sv|4618
B|Yeah|b|4618
A|So, I don't know.|sd|4618
A|And I, I think it could be used to hassle somebody.|sv|4618
A|If someone was out to get you, I think that a company or a boss could use this.|sv|4618
A|You know, they could keep on doing this to you or something, I guess.|sv|4618
A|I can see where it could become a problem.|sv|4618
B|And it, it's like, it seems like now they have tests|sv|4618
B|I guess they can test your hair|sd|4618
B|and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago.|sd|4618
A|Really. maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago. *sv|b|4618
B|So,|%|4618
B|I know.|aa|4618
A|That's the other thing.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|4618
A|I mean a lot of, a lot of people as kids or, you know, young people get into some things that they get out of later on|sd|4618
A|and I don't think they should really have to pay for that forever.|sv|4618
B|Yeah.|aa|4618
B|There's a lot of things you do as a kid that  you wouldn't do as an adult|sd|4618
A|Yeah.|b|4618
B|but  you can't say it was wrong at the time.|sv|4618
A|I think that's true.|aa|4618
A|Yeah,|aa|4618
A|yeah.|aa|4618
A|So that probably wouldn't be too good either.|sv|4618
