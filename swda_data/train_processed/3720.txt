A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3720
A|yeah,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3720
A|Donna, um, you said you have three children.|bf|3720
A|What, uh, kinds of activities do you spend with them?|qw|3720
A|Is it ?|qy|3720
B|Okay,|b|3720
B|um, we have an eleven year old, an eight year old, and a three year old|sd|3720
B|and, um,  uh, my husband, let's see, he coaches basketball with Brian, um,|sd|3720
A|Uh-huh.|b|3720
B|so he spends time doing that with him, planning and, um, practicing outside.|sd|3720
A|Uh-huh.|b|3720
B|Um, he's a real sports kind of person,|sd|3720
B|so he plays tennis with, with the kids.|sd|3720
B|We all kind of play tennis as a family,|sd|3720
B|except the baby plays in the playground.|sd|3720
A|Uh-huh.|b|3720
B|We take turns with her.|sd|3720
B|Um, uh, let's see,|^h|3720
B|we have a computer|sd|3720
B|and we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer.|sd|3720
B|Um, uh, let's what else we do.|^h|3720
B|Oh, plus we watch a little T V together.|sd|3720
B|We really don't watch, I think, as much T V as a lot of people.|sd|3720
A|Uh-huh.|b|3720
B|We don't have H B O.|sd|3720
B|We do get the Disney channel for the kids.|sd|3720
A|Uh-huh.|b|3720
B|Uh, my kids have a Nintendo which they play,|sd|3720
B|and my husband sometimes joins them with that.|sd|3720
A|Uh-huh.|b|3720
B|Uh, my little girl, Jennifer, likes to do crafty things,|sd|3720
B|and I'll take some time and do that with her.|sd|3720
B|And, of course, we always read a bedtime story at night,|sd|3720
B|and even the, the older kids sometimes sit down and, and will join in and listen to a story.|sd|3720
B|I'm,  basically the story person because my husband doesn't have,|sd|3720
A|Uh-huh.|b|3720
B|he gets home from work late or whatever|sd|3720
B|and, and usually, once in a while he'll read the story to little one,|sd|3720
B|but that's basically my job|sd|3720
A|Yeah.|b|3720
B|Um|b|3720
A|So do you find it difficult to find time,|qy|3720
A|or is it pretty natural ?|qrr|3720
B|It is. It is hard because, you know, at the end of your day you want time for yourself|na|3720
A|Uh-huh.|b|3720
A|Yeah.|b|3720
B|and, and it,|%|3720
B|and that's kind of cutting into your, your time.|sd|3720
A|Yeah.|b|3720
B|And with the kids getting older, now on the weekends they get to the bed like at ten which really is late,|sd|3720
A|Uh-huh.|b|3720
B|but, you know, on school nights, the two older ones get to bed about nine.|sd|3720
B|They go upstairs at nine,|sd|3720
B|and, um, now, this weekend we'll have a baby-sitter come|sd|3720
B|and, uh, my husband and I will go out to dinner and come home and, um, probably not too late.|sd|3720
A|Uh-huh .|b|3720
B|Maybe Brian will still be up, and spend some time with him.|sd|3720
B|But it, it's really hard.|sd|3720
B|You have to be a very unselfish person to, to spend a lot of time with your kids, I think.|sv|3720
A|Yeah,|aa|3720
A|yeah.|aa|3720
A|Do you work during the day?|qy|3720
B|Uh, no,|nn|3720
B|I don't work.|sd|3720
B|I, last year, um, I had a little part time job in a private, um, high school, tutoring, um, high school students with learning disabilities.|sd|3720
A|Uh-huh.|b|3720
B|That was two days a week,|sd|3720
B|and even just those two days just seemed like it was a lot.|sd|3720
B|I don't know how,|%|3720
B|I admire,  people that, that can do it all,|sd|3720
A|Yeah.|b|3720
B|but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way I want it kept, it is hard.|sd|3720
A|Yeah.|b|3720
A|I can imagine.|ba|3720
B|Um.|b|3720
A|Yeah.|b|3720
B|Even just finding the time to do the grocery shopping and everything.|sd|3720
A|Uh-huh|b|3720
B|And that's another thing,|sd|3720
B|I'll take one of the kids with me grocery shopping, um, usually on the weekend,|sd|3720
B|and that's kind of like a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son,|sd|3720
B|and they'll be my helper,|sd|3720
B|and then they'll get to pick out some of those favorite snacks that they get to pick out|sd|3720
B|so, I try to do things like that,|sd|3720
A|Yeah.|b|3720
B|but it, you know, it's, it's, uh,|%|3720
A|Yeah.|b|3720
B|And then, of course, they have a pretty, um, busy social calendar too|sd|3720
A|Uh-huh.|b|3720
B|You fit it in with all that, that.|sd|3720
A|Yeah.|b|3720
A|So what do you feel are the current trends in the way families spend time in general, you know, in America?|qo|3720
B|I, I think a lot of people, a lot of people set their kids in front of the T V and H B O and rent movies and, and,  kind of leave them to their own means. Um,|sv|3720
A|Uh-huh.|b|3720
A|Yeah.|b|3720
B|I think, you know, it's very, very easy to fall into that trap,|sv|3720
B|and I'm not, um, totally innocent of that because,  there's times when you just stay here, watch a tape.|sv|3720
A|Uh-huh.|b|3720
A|Yeah.|b|3720
B|But, um, um, I think different parts of the country,|sv|3720
B|I think in Plano and maybe this area in Texas, there's a lot of community activities that parents could join in with their kids.|sv|3720
B|People are,  real sports conscious and really get involved with their kids, sports activities and,|sv|3720
A|Uh-huh|b|3720
A|Oh, that's good.|ba|3720
B|You know, but, um,|%|3720
A|Yeah.|b|3720
A|Yeah,|b|3720
A|well, families are facing a challenge,|sv|3720
A|I know that with,|%|3720
B|What,|%|3720
A|I'm a newlywed|sd|3720
A|and we're you know, thinking about having children sometime in the next couple of years|sd|3720
B|Uh-huh.|b|3720
A|and,|%|3720
B|Uh-huh.|b|3720
B|And it's, it's very hard, because when you get used to two salaries, it's very hard to, to cut back to one.|sv|3720
A|Yeah.|b|3720
B|And, um, um, but, you know, if you have the type of job,|%|3720
B|I have a friend that's a nurse|sd|3720
B|and she can pick her hours|sd|3720
B|and|%|3720
A|Uh-huh.|b|3720
B|that's a, a great career.|sv|3720
B|I wish I would have gone into, uh, nursing|sd|3720
A|Yeah.|b|3720
B|because she has such a flexible schedule,|sd|3720
B|but it's very hard to, uh, spend time with the children and, uh, and your husband and do everything at once.|sv|3720
A|Uh-huh.|b|3720
A|Yeah.|aa|3720
A|But I do feel like it's important that you make the time for children because ,|sv|3720
B|Well, I think it's a big, it's a big, um, responsibility.|sv|3720
B|You just don't,  have children so that you can continue the lifestyle you had when you were single.|sv|3720
A|Yeah.|b|3720
A|Yeah.|b|3720
B|When you have children, you have to say, now, this is different|sv|3720
B|and you do have to give things up.|sv|3720
B|I, I personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child, um, for the,  at least for the first two years of their lives. I mean, if you,  can possibly swing it|sv|3720
B|because they,|%|3720
