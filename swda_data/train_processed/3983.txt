A|Um, so I take it that you like to ski.|qy^d|3983
A|Do you, do you, um, receive a lot of information on skiing through the SKI MAGAZINE?|qy|3983
B|I presume that I do.|na|3983
A|Uh-huh.|bk|3983
B|Uh, I suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth, because I do get things from ski associations and things, uh, at, during the year.|sd|3983
A|Oh.|b|3983
A|Oh, uh, and do you receive discounts and things like that,|qy|3983
A|do you think|qy|3983
A|or,|%|3983
B|Uh, not so much that, I, uh, more likely to see those at a ski show or something,|ng|3983
B|but um, made with I just enjoy reading about the resorts and where you can go and, and new equipment that's come out and so forth.|sd|3983
A|Oh.|bk|3983
B|Some fashions are always in there too.|sd|3983
A|Oh.|b|3983
A|Uh-huh.|b|3983
A|So would this vacation you're taking,|qy|3983
A|did you receive information from your skiing magazine?|qy|3983
B|Probably not.|ng|3983
B|Uh, we already knew we wanted to take one,|sd|3983
B|and we just started looking around.|sd|3983
B|I may have referred to a couple of them,|sd|3983
B|but we went to the ski show and looked at all of the resort information, picked up a lot of brochures and just decided to go to Crested Butte.|sd|3983
A|Oh.|bk|3983
A|Oh.|bk|3983
B|We haven't been there before.|sd|3983
A|Um, that sounds nice.|ba|3983
B|Kind of away from the crowd is why we chose that one.|sd|3983
A|Uh-huh.|b|3983
B|It's supposedly low lift lines.|sd|3983
A|Oh.|b|3983
B|But I haven't skied Utah yet,|sd|3983
B|but I want to.|sd|3983
A|Oh, well, you need to come out|ad|3983
B|I'd like to go to Sundance and Park City and some of those.|sd|3983
A|Uh-huh.|b|3983
B|I understand Deer Valley is nice, too.|sd|3983
A|Deer Valley,|b|3983
A|uh-huh.|aa|3983
A|Yeah,|aa|3983
A|they are,|aa|3983
A|it's wonderful snow|sv|3983
B|Well, how about you,|qo|3983
B|what, what magazines do you have at home?|qo|3983
A|Uh, I am currently taking DECORATIVE WOODWORKING, and, uh, COUNTRY LIVING,|sd|3983
A|and, let's see, we do have NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC,|sd|3983
A|and then we have some church magazines,|sd|3983
A|but I really enjoy the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING.|sd|3983
A|I'm heavy into woodworking and tole painting and things like that,|sd|3983
A|so the DECORATIVE WOODWORKING has just been a great, great help.|sd|3983
B|Oh, okay.|bk|3983
B|Does it have, uh, articles on how to do things as well as equipment that you can buy and so forth?|qy|3983
A|Uh-huh.|ny|3983
A|Uh-huh,|ny|3983
A|they do have, uh, mostly they have, uh, the ads on the equipment,|sd|3983
A|but the whole magazine is just filled with, uh, pictures and projects that you can make yourself,|sd|3983
A|and then it has all of the patterns and instructions that you would need to make a wood project, and, and then how to paint it with the tole paintings,|sd|3983
A|and so, it's really a fun one.|sd|3983
A|I like that.|sd|3983
B|Well, that's good.|ba|3983
B|It's good to get use out of one.|sv|3983
A|Uh-huh|aa|3983
B|I'm not sure that, um, in the case of NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC,|%|3983
B|I mean, I read it,|sd|3983
B|but then they just sort of gather dust for a long period of time,|sd|3983
A|Uh-huh.|b|3983
B|but then eventually there'll be a school project or something where my son will need to refer back through forty-eight back issues to find you know, France or something or whatever it is he's looking for.|sd|3983
A|Uh-huh|b|3983
A|Yeah.|b|3983
A|Yes.|aa|3983
A|I've, I've noticed that, too,|aa|3983
A|but they have been nice to have around.|sv|3983
A|Every once in a while they come in handy|sv|3983
B|I used to take SMITHSONIAN too,|sd|3983
A|Oh.|b|3983
B|I liked that magazine|sd|3983
A|Uh-huh.|b|3983
B|but it was, I was, just found myself not ever getting around to reading it.|sd|3983
A|Oh. Uh.|b|3983
B|You get so many coming in,|sv|3983
B|and by the time the next round comes in I'm still not through reading the first round.|sd|3983
A|Oh, that.|b|3983
B|Oh, SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN comes to our house, too, I forgot,|sd|3983
B|and that's mostly my son's,|sd|3983
A|Oh.|b|3983
B|but but I do read it, too.|sd|3983
A|Uh-huh.|b|3983
A|Oh, well that sounds like.|%|3983
B|And he takes GAMES MAGAZINE GAME MAGAZINE, which has puzzles and things that he likes to solve, you know, crosswords and various logic puzzles and things like that|sd|3983
A|Uh-huh.|b|3983
A|Oh.|b|3983
A|Uh-huh.|b|3983
B|he likes to try that,|sd|3983
B|so. He does, uh, does get to be a lot of paper though,|sd|3983
B|after a while if you don't keep them weeded out, they almost take over.|sv|3983
A|Uh-huh|b|3983
A|They do, they can do that.|aa|3983
A|I found that they've been fun for my little girls,|sd|3983
A|they're five and four years old,|sd|3983
A|and they like to go through|sd|3983
A|and,|%|3983
B|Oh, yeah,|b|3983
B|they're just kind of getting started now.|qy^d|3983
A|Uh-huh. They like to cut the pictures out and paste them on,|ny|3983
A|and so we've found good use for those.|sd|3983
B|Mine is a senior in high school,|sd|3983
B|so he's, we're kind of at the end of that trail.|sd|3983
A|Oh.|b|3983
B|You're just sort of beginning to think about first grade.|qy^d|3983
A|Oh.|b|3983
A|Uh-huh.|b|3983
A|Yeah,|ny|3983
A|it's fun.|sd|3983
A|Well, I do have a boy in junior high, too,|sd|3983
A|so|%|3983
B|Oh, okay,|bk|3983
B|so you got a little bit of a gap there between,|bf|3983
A|so we're kind of running the gamut|sd|3983
A|Yeah.|%|3983
