A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3535
A|where does she live?|qw|3535
B|Uh, on Rutherford.|sd|3535
A|Rutherford.|b^m|3535
A|I don't know that.|sd|3535
B|It's, uh, corner of New York uh, just west of Mayfield.|sd|3535
A|Uh-huh.|b|3535
A|It's, oh, oh, south and, okay,|bk|3535
A|yeah,|b|3535
A|I know where you, I know the area.|sd|3535
B|Uh.|%|3535
A|Right,|b|3535
A|that's kind of on the other side of town,|sd|3535
A|so our kids probably never went to school together or anything|sd|3535
B|Oh, okay.|bk|3535
B|Oh, they're, they're little ones|sd|3535
A|Oh, well, I've got one in college|sd|3535
B|Oh.|b|3535
A|By now.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3535
B|Let's see, we're on government,  whether we think it's honest or can be.|sd|3535
A|Right.|aa|3535
A|Whether it is possible to have an honest government. I'm beginning to think it's not.|sd|3535
A|What about you?|qo|3535
B|I, I don't think under the way the system is right now, it is.|sv|3535
A|I don't either.|aa|3535
A|I, I think,|sv|3535
A|uh, even if people have good intentions, I think uh, power corrupts or something to a certain extent, you know.|sv|3535
B|The ultimate power, ultimately corrupts.|sv|3535
A|Yeah,|aa|3535
A|it seems like, uh, maybe more of them come in with good intentions,|sv|3535
A|but it's just so enticing,|sv|3535
A|and a lot of corners being cut and the special deals available, because they're in on the know , you know|sv|3535
B|I don't know if,  there is enough money that you could pay them just,  you know X amount of money to keep them honest.|sd|3535
A|Oh.|b|3535
B|I just, I just don't, uh,|sd|3535
A|Right.|aa|3535
A|I mean, you even see people on a small scale cheating when they have certain positions,|sv|3535
A|you know what I mean?|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3535
B|Right.|aa|3535
A|Little bitty, little bitty positions in your own home town, and they'll cheat somehow or, you know, bend the rules, use their power.|sv|3535
A|So maybe it's just man's nature|sv|3535
B|We had, uh, here in Oklahoma we had a few years ago a major, uh, corruption on, on our county commissioners|sd|3535
A|Uh-huh.|b|3535
B|and there were several counties, uh, including the one I was in, that lost every one of their county commissioners|sd|3535
B|and, I mean, it was to the point of not just losing their job, but going to jail.|sd|3535
A|Oh, my word.|ba|3535
A|Oh, wow.|ba|3535
A|What were they doing taking some,|qw|3535
B|Oh, they were taking kickbacks.|sd|3535
A|Oh, no|ba|3535
B|Yeah|b|3535
A|Oh, gosh.|ba|3535
B|Just a little here, a little there.|sd|3535
A|Yeah,|b|3535
A|right|b|3535
B|Major amount here, a major amount there.|sd|3535
A|Right|b|3535
A|Oh.|%|3535
B|But I think there was something like, you know, thirty or forty commissioners that ended up going to jail.|sd|3535
A|Um. We haven't had that big a scandal in Arlington,|sd|3535
A|but we do have the people that work for the convention center were falsifying records.|sd|3535
A|In other words, they'd go out and have a big, lavish dinner and then put somebody's name down that they supposedly had entertained,|sd|3535
A|but that person wasn't even anywhere near there, you know.|sd|3535
A|Some of them weren't even in the same city.|sd|3535
A|One of them had, had cancer and died|sd|3535
A|and I mean, that was our biggest scandal for the last few years, I think.|sd|3535
B|Uh, that's, that's small scale.|sv|3535
B|I don't know, you know,|h|3535
B|I really don't know what could be done. Uh,|sd|3535
A|I don't, I don't either. Uh, to make it totally honest.|sd|3535
A|Uh, I think there's, there's always going to be some way somebody can cut a corner, uh.|sv|3535
A|However, the things that have gone, gone on in the last couple of years, we can't afford too many of those, you know, the  the HUD mess or the S and L.|sv|3535
B|That's right.|aa|3535
A|We could almost not afford such terrible corruption.|sv|3535
B|The cover-ups and,|sv|3535
A|Right,|aa|3535
A|right.|aa|3535
A|I think that, uh, Reagan and Bush were up to their necks in that Iran Contra thing,|sv|3535
A|and it kind of makes you feel bad that the top people in your country would be lying to you like that,|sv|3535
A|but, uh,|%|3535
B|I, uh, I don't know.|h|3535
B|I just, uh, I'd like to believe that there is some way that our political people would really go there and look out for our interests.|sd|3535
A|Right.|b|3535
B|I think that's what upsets me worse than, that they're getting a little, you know, uh, on the side that, that,  it seems that when they get up there it's, it's what, if I vote your way, what it'll do for me rather,  than this is the way my constituents want it.|sd|3535
A|Uh-huh,|b|3535
A|uh-huh.|b|3535
A|That's right,|aa|3535
A|but they stay there,|sd|3535
A|Uh-huh.|b|3535
A|Right,|aa|3535
A|and this would be for the best for the nation overall.|sv|3535
A|You're right,|aa|3535
A|it's just a,|%|3535
A|I don't know.|h|3535
A|I guess that's where they stay in, uh, in,|sv|3535
A|they try to stay in office.|sv|3535
A|But they always please the money people too.|sv|3535
A|They need money so much, because they're constantly having to run,  for office again.|sv|3535
B|run,|^2|3535
A|And,|%|3535
B|Maybe|arp_nd|3535
B|and then you think, well, if it was longer terms then they would never have to try to please the people at home|sv|3535
A|Uh-huh.|b|3535
A|That's true.|aa|3535
A|Boy, it is a big problem,|sv|3535
A|but I think most people are kind of depressed and cynical about government now,|sv|3535
A|don't you?|^g|3535
B|I don't think that they, anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government.|sv|3535
A|I know.|aa|3535
A|It's really terrible.|sv|3535
A|I mean, there was a time, I mean where, I remember when I was real young, I just loved Harry Truman.|sd|3535
A|I thought he was great|sd|3535
A|Oh, you know, I had,|%|3535
A|some of them seemed like kind of, uh, heroic people.|sd|3535
B|Well I wonder if they really were,  or if we just really didn't,|sd|3535
