A|All right.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|2790
B|What, what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation?|qw|2790
A|I guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force.|sv|2790
B|Yeah.|b|2790
A|Few are, uh, basically staying home and being homemakers, and raising kids exclusively.|sv|2790
B|Uh-huh.|aa|2790
B|Yeah,|aa|2790
B|I, I, I grew up in, uh, sixties and early seventies|sd|2790
B|and, uh, my mom didn't work at all when I was growing up.|sd|2790
B|She didn't start working until I was, um, well into high school.|sd|2790
A|Uh-huh.|b|2790
B|So, I, I had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays kids, it's a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids.|sv|2790
A|Yeah,|aa|2790
A|true.|aa|2790
A|Well, mine taught kindergarten|sd|2790
A|but she was always, uh,|sd|2790
A|I guess her schedule was shorter|sd|2790
A|so she was always, uh,  home,|sd|2790
B|Always home by the time you got home.|^2|2790
A|yeah.|%|2790
A|Yeah,|%|2790
A|that, that statistic I guess has been growing every year|sv|2790
A|it's like something around sixty, sixty-five percent or so now.|sd|2790
B|Uh-huh.|b|2790
A|Uh, I'm not sure what the future holds for that|sd|2790
A|whether,|%|2790
B|It seems like there's, it seems that there's a grass roots, um, effort or whatever going on|sv|2790
B|I, I, um, clean houses part-time,|sd|2790
A|Uh-huh.|b|2790
B|and almost all the people that I clean for, believe it or not, are mothers that don't work|sd|2790
A|Huh.|b|2790
B|Um,|b|2790
A|That's unusual|ba|2790
B|they are, they're all, um,|%|2790
B|it's, and it's, I think it's kind of a new movement|sv|2790
B|it's going back towards, you know,|sv|2790
B|women have come into the work force in the last twenty, thirty years|sd|2790
B|and now they're wanting to go back to the old days where, you know, women stayed home with the kids, you know, and try to give the kids quality time.|sv|2790
A|Uh-huh.|b|2790
B|And I, I think that in the future you're, I think you're going to see a lot more, um, women choosing to not work after they have a baby.|sv|2790
A|Yeah.|b|2790
B|Um, I think with, uh, the, uh, the work force with the, the salaries that|sv|2790
B|a lot of, a lot of the women that I work for have husbands who are, um, vice-presidents of companies|sd|2790
B|and I think with, uh, um, this, it seems like it's more the upper-class people,|sv|2790
A|Uh-huh.|b|2790
B|um, I don't see it as much, the, like in my situation where I don't, I don't have children yet,|sd|2790
B|but ideally I would like to be able to stay home with my kids.|sd|2790
B|But realistically that's, I'm, I'm realizing that's probably not going to be possible, um, for middle-class people to be able to live just on one income.|sv|2790
A|Yeah,|aa|2790
A|that is tough.|sv|2790
A|Yeah,|aa|2790
A|we're looking at that now,|sd|2790
A|my wife's about six months along.|sd|2790
B|Uh-huh.|b|2790
B|I think it's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids.|sv|2790
A|Uh-huh.|b|2790
B|You know, it's going to kind of kind of go along with the B M W in the driveway and, or in the garage or whatever.|sv|2790
A|True.|ba|2790
B|Um, and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever.|sv|2790
A|Yeah.|aa|2790
A|I'm surprised that the main people you work for are women that do stay home.|sd|2790
A|I would think it would be women that were working full-time.|sv|2790
B|Yeah,|aa|2790
B|believe it or not though the, all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home.|sv|2790
A|Huh.|b|2790
B|Um, they're real active in volunteer work.|sv|2790
A|Uh-huh.|b|2790
B|Um, one of the women is real active with, uh, Muscular Dystrophy. And, uh, does a lot of, of work with them on a volunteer basis|sd|2790
B|but it's still, it's almost like a job,|sv|2790
B|she just doesn't get paid for it.|sd|2790
A|Huh. Well, I guess that's good that they, they've got something to keep them active.|sv|2790
B|Yeah.|aa|2790
B|When, when your wife has her baby, is she going to stay home|qy|2790
B|or is she going to,  go back to work?|qrr|2790
A|Yeah,|ny|2790
A|we're,  we're going to try and have her stay home, for as long as possible.|sd|2790
A|What do you think?|qo|2790
B|That, that, that,|%|2790
B|I would, I would like to be able to do that.|sd|2790
A|Yeah,|b|2790
A|we think it's, uh, that important|sv|2790
A|and I, I kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction.|sd|2790
A|I'm a, a counselor and a therapist,|sd|2790
B|Uh-huh.|b|2790
A|and I work with adolescents,|sd|2790
A|and I see some of the problems the kids have when they don't have a real good family structure.|sd|2790
B|Yeah,|b|2790
B|I, I see a difference in the generation of, even the generation before me,  uh, were, you know, mom was like, um, Mrs Cleaver, uh, you know, June Cleaver or whatever,|sv|2790
A|Uh-huh.|b|2790
B|where the, the attitudes were a lot different.|sv|2790
B|Um, as far as, I think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more,|sv|2790
B|um, there wasn't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and,  um, a lot of the, the things that are going on in today's society,|sv|2790
A|Uh-huh.|b|2790
B|I think morally, um, it seems like there was, people were a lot better back then as far as higher standards.|sv|2790
A|True.|ba|2790
A|Well, the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure|sv|2790
A|and with women working so much they're kind of pulled out of it too.|sv|2790
B|Yeah.|b|2790
A|So, kids are raised around their friends and by the media.|sv|2790
B|Yeah,|aa|2790
B|that's true.|aa|2790
A|And that's, you know, that's contributed,|sv|2790
B|And I think, I think you're going to see a lot more of that in the future.|sv|2790
A|Yeah,|aa|2790
A|maybe that's contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time,|sv|2790
A|so. If there was some way for, for women to, to stay home even if they could work, you know,|sv|2790
A|there are a lot of jobs that are coming about, like in computers at home,  and those types of things, that would at least in some ways, um, bridge the gap|sv|2790
B|Uh-huh.|b|2790
B|Yeah,|aa|2790
B|I, I think that, um, in the future, um, the, the family unit as it, as it once was known, is, is going to be nonexistent|sv|2790
B|What, how do you, what do you think?|qo|2790
A|About?|qw|2790
B|That as far as|%|2790
B|do you think there's going to be still a family unit|qy|2790
B|or, or do you think that, um, the trend is going more towards single parenting?|qrr|2790
A|The balance|%|2790
A|I don't,|%|2790
A|the, the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so|sd|2790
A|and it got higher than that for a while.|sd|2790
A|Um, that's hard to say.|sv|2790
A|Families are such a strange configuration anymore.|sv|2790
A|Um, I, I see a lot of families where,|sd|2790
A|you know, in the, in the back,|%|2790
A|I grew up about the same time you did,|sd|2790
B|Uh-huh.|b|2790
A|and back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be responsible.|sv|2790
B|Uh-huh.|b|2790
A|Uh, nowadays it's not the case,|sv|2790
A|kids don't, kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk|sv|2790
A|and one of the reasons, I guess, is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working.|sv|2790
A|They get bombarded with junk|sv|2790
A|and they don't have to do anything around the house.|sv|2790
A|They never learned to be responsible when,|sv|2790
B|Yeah.|b|2790
A|the bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while|sv|2790
A|and they come back,|sv|2790
A|and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad|sv|2790
A|so,|%|2790
B|Yeah.|b|2790
A|you know, you create a bigger, bigger family, generation after generation but not really on purpose.|sv|2790
B|Yeah.|b|2790
A|So. It's not, not a real functional situation anyway.|sv|2790
A|So, you know, I don't know it's, I don't know that that trend's going to change the single parent type families|sd|2790
A|and the families, as long as we've got so many other crazy things going on in society.|sv|2790
B|Yeah,|b|2790
B|I, I think that eventually the, the family unit's just not going to even exist anymore.|sv|2790
B|like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that I think there's going to be more single parent families than there are, um, you know, two parent families.|sv|2790
A|Uh-huh.|b|2790
B|That's pretty sad.|ba|2790
A|Yeah,|aa|2790
A|it is,|aa|2790
A|I guess unless, unless there's a, a major swing in the change of what's important to people, you know, probably keep going downhill.|sv|2790
A|And I, I don't know|h|2790
A|we, we feel like that, that we can make it on one income|sv|2790
A|it, it may be tough|sv|2790
A|but we may have to give up on some, some things.|sv|2790
B|I, I think in the long run though your child will benefit from that.|sv|2790
A|Yeah.|b|2790
B|And it will, it will make the, the strain worthwhile.|sv|2790
A|Yeah,|aa|2790
A|I think so too.|aa|2790
B|Well, I, I need to go ahead and, and wrap it up.|fc|2790
A|Okay.|fc|2790
B|Um, it was really nice talking to you.|fc|2790
A|Well, I've enjoyed it, Stephanie.|fc|2790
B|And, uh, thanks a lot.|fc|2790
A|Uh-huh.|fc|2790
B|Okay,|fc|2790
B|bye-bye.|fc|2790
A|Bye-bye.|fc|2790
