A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|2469
A|what kind of hobbies do you have?|qo|2469
B|Um, mostly what I do,|sd|2469
B|I do do some crafts like it mentioned in the thing,|sd|2469
B|and then I, I read a lot.|sd|2469
A|Uh-huh.|b|2469
A|I like to read, too|sd|2469
A|I was trying to think of some while, while it was, uh, talking about it,|sd|2469
A|and then I,|%|2469
A|it took so long for someone to answer,|sd|2469
A|I started reading the newspaper, and kind of forgot about it|sd|2469
B|Oh.|b|2469
A|But, uh, yeah,|b|2469
A|I'd say reading is probably one of my biggest ones, because it's the type of thing that you can, you can do a little bit at a time, whereas, I would love to do crafts and stuff if I just had the time to do it or if I had the space.|sd|2469
B|Uh-huh.|b|2469
A|I live in a pretty small apartment,|sd|2469
A|and, uh, I would have to, you know, put stuff away.|sd|2469
A|I have two cats,|sd|2469
A|so I couldn't really leave it out if I was working on something.|sd|2469
B|Uh-huh.|b|2469
A|Reading is a little bit easier to work around.|sv|2469
B|Yeah,|aa|2469
B|you can pick it up and take it wherever you go. any space.|sv|2469
A|That's right.|aa|2469
B|I get too involved in reading sometimes that I neglect what I should be doing.|sd|2469
A|That's true,|aa|2469
A|I do the same thing|sd|2469
B|You get so involved in what you're reading.|sv|2469
A|What types of crafts do you do?|qo|2469
B|I do a little bit of woodworking,|sd|2469
B|well, I used to.|sd|2469
B|I don't have the equipment here.|sd|2469
B|We moved to Dallas about a year ago|sd|2469
A|Uh-huh.|b|2469
B|and my dad had a lot of woodworking equipment|sd|2469
A|Uh-huh.|b|2469
B|and I did some of that. Um,|sd|2469
B|here I've mostly done things that I can do strictly by hand, um, sewing and quilting and, um,|sd|2469
B|what else have I done|t1|2469
B|Things to hang on the wall.|sd|2469
A|Uh-huh.|b|2469
B|Mostly just stuff that I can, you know, use right around the house or give away as gifts.|sd|2469
A|Uh-huh.|b|2469
A|Right.|b|2469
B|I've been making a lot of quilts, well, not a lot, but several quilts lately.|sd|2469
A|Uh-huh.|b|2469
B|So.|%|2469
A|I enjoy, uh, sewing and needlework also.|sd|2469
A|I've, I've, uh, made some small things, cross stitch things.|sd|2469
A|And, um back when I was in high school, I worked at a needlework shop,|sd|2469
B|Uh-huh.|b|2469
A|and I, I used to do the latch hook rugs and needlepoint and things like that,|sd|2469
A|and I, I still remember how to do it.|sd|2469
A|It's just been so long since I've actually sat down and taken the time to do something like that.|sd|2469
A|But I have recently done some cross stitch.|sd|2469
B|Uh-huh.|b|2469
A|And I enjoy doing that.|sd|2469
A|It's just the same old thing,|sv|2469
A|it's just getting the time to do it|sv|2469
B|Yeah.|aa|2469
B|I've done some cross, um, cross stitch,|sd|2469
B|but I never count right,|sd|2469
B|and I always have to either take it out or have my picture slightly off centered or, or something.|sd|2469
A|Uh-huh|b|2469
B|It never has worked out completely.|sd|2469
A|Yeah,|b|2469
A|it takes a lot of concentration.|sv|2469
A|I mean, it was the type of thing,|sd|2469
A|I was, I was making some little things for Christmas,|sd|2469
A|and I also made a little thing for a baby gift,|sd|2469
A|and, uh, I thought, Oh, I can do this while I watch T V.|sd|2469
A|Wrong|sd|2469
B|Right.|b|2469
A|No,|ar|2469
A|you must pay all attention to what you're doing.|sv|2469
A|It's, it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be.|sv|2469
A|It took me, uh, quite a bit of time.|sd|2469
A|I though, Oh, this won't take long at all.|sd|2469
A|But I was wrong.|sd|2469
B|Uh-huh.|b|2469
A|It took, it took a while to do.|sd|2469
A|But, it was fun,|sd|2469
A|I enjoyed it.|sd|2469
B|Yeah.|b|2469
B|The first project I started out one was a big one,|sd|2469
B|it was, uh, it was of a lady|sd|2469
B|and she was kneeling,|sd|2469
B|and it was about fifteen by twenty maybe.|sd|2469
A|Oh my gosh.|ba|2469
B|And I,|%|2469
B|it was just too much to start with.|sd|2469
B|And I still haven't finished it, because I, I stopped,|sd|2469
B|and I thought I better do some simple things and work up to this because it was just so difficult to get it done.|sd|2469
A|Uh-huh.|b|2469
A|Yeah.|b|2469
B|And there were so many different shadings and colors,|sd|2469
B|and, and, it was just too much to begin with.|sd|2469
B|And I think kind of discouraged me from doing much more with it.|sd|2469
A|Yeah.|b|2469
A|That's pretty understandable.|ba|2469
B|And I've done some of the crewel and the, um something similar to that|sd|2469
A|Uh-huh.|b|2469
B|but it doesn't have the specific stitches.|sd|2469
B|Anyway, it's a little bit more loose, and not quite as structured,|sd|2469
B|and I like that a little bit better the variety of stitches and stuff in that.|sd|2469
A|Uh-huh.|b|2469
B|More like embroidery or something.|sd|2469
A|I'm trying to think of anything else I do as a hobby. Um. I don't even watch T V very much.|sd|2469
A|I was tonight,|sd|2469
A|but|%|2469
B|Yeah.|b|2469
B|I was reading when you called.|sd|2469
A|Yeah.|b|2469
B|How about movies,|qo|2469
B|do you like to go to movies?|qy|2469
A|Yeah|ny|2469
A|I do, I do like to go to movies,|sd|2469
A|and I have a V C R,|sd|2469
A|so I like to rent movies,|sd|2469
A|and, um, I have, right now I have the movie channel,|sd|2469
A|so I've recorded quite a few movies off of that. Um,|sd|2469
A|just, I've kind of got a collection going of tapes now,|sd|2469
A|and whenever I go visit my parents, they're always saying, Well, bring some of your tapes|sd|2469
A|They always borrow a few of them.|sd|2469
A|I was over there,|sd|2469
A|they live in Duncanville|sd|2469
B|Uh-huh.|b|2469
A|and I was over there at Easter,|sd|2469
A|and they said, Bring some tapes with you.|sd|2469
A|So they are always borrowing my tapes.|sd|2469
B|Yeah.|b|2469
A|But, uh,|%|2469
B|Well we,|%|2469
A|I like to, I like to do, uh, stuff with plants.|sd|2469
A|I like, um, I have a lot of plants in my apartment,|sd|2469
A|and I've got a pretty small porch,|sd|2469
A|but it's, it's, uh,|%|2469
A|I've got a few planters out there that I, I'll, uh, you know,|sd|2469
A|in the winter time I usually plant some pansies in there,|sd|2469
A|and then in the summer I'll plant petunias,|sd|2469
A|or something that's colorful|sd|2469
A|and like, that blooms a lot.|sd|2469
A|But haven't done that yet.|sd|2469
B|Uh-huh.|b|2469
A|I kept thinking that it was going to get cold one more time,|sd|2469
A|but I think we're probably past that now.|sd|2469
A|I probably should go buy some.|sd|2469
B|Yeah.|b|2469
A|I guess if I had a house I might enjoy gardening, some.|sd|2469
A|I'm not real crazy about pulling weeds and things like that.|sd|2469
B|Yeah,|b|2469
B|it's the hard work.|sv|2469
A|Yeah,|aa|2469
A|I like the planting, and watering is okay.|sd|2469
B|It's so nice though when you have a nice yard full of flowers,|sv|2469
B|it's so|sv|2469
B|I mean, we don't.|sd|2469
B|We live in an apartment also.|sd|2469
A|Uh-huh.|b|2469
B|I've got a few plants here,|sd|2469
B|but I'm not really knowledgeable.|sd|2469
B|I feel real good if I water them|sd|2469
B|and they continue to grow.|sd|2469
B|You know, I feel like, Oh, I've accomplished something.|sd|2469
A|Uh-huh.|b|2469
B|So I enjoy it,|sd|2469
B|but I'm just not experienced enough with|sd|2469
A|Yeah.|b|2469
A|I don't know too much about it either.|sd|2469
A|Mine's pretty limited to my little, uh, porch plants|sd|2469
A|And then the ones in my apartment, half of which don't look real healthy,|sd|2469
A|but I don't always get direct sun except in certain spots.|sd|2469
B|Oh, yeah.|b|2469
A|And so that's probably my problem there.|sd|2469
A|But,|%|2469
B|Have you tried any, growing any, um, like fruits and vegetables or anything?|qy|2469
B|I guess vegetables are in, like in pots and stuff?|qy|2469
A|No,|nn|2469
A|I never have tried that, just because I don't have that much space on this little porch here in this apartment or this little balcony.|sd|2469
B|Uh-huh.|b|2469
A|And my other two pots are,|sd|2469
A|they're kind of, they're pretty big,|sd|2469
A|and I have enough plants in them that it takes up a lot of my porch area,|sd|2469
A|so between that and the chairs and the barbecue grill and the fireplace wood, there's no room for much else.|sd|2469
A|But my dad, uh, my dad used to grow tomatoes and things at the house.|sd|2469
A|And I'd, I think when I was real little I probably had a finger in on that every time he did it and had to be out there and watch and that type of stuff.|sd|2469
B|Uh-huh.|b|2469
A|But I've never really tried anything like that since then.|sd|2469
B|Well, I considered it last year|sd|2469
B|and this year both,|sd|2469
B|but I haven't done anything about it.|sd|2469
A|Uh-huh.|b|2469
B|So. I think it would be nice to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch.|sv|2469
B|We get lots of sunlight here,|sd|2469
B|and the porch is screened in|sd|2469
B|and it's pretty large.|sd|2469
A|Oh, wow.|ba|2469
B|So, um, I think if I just would be,|%|2469
B|if I'd do something, be motivated enough to do something, I think it would work out well.|sd|2469
A|Uh-huh.|b|2469
B|But, but there goes that motivation thing again|sd|2469
A|Right.|aa|2469
A|Well, I enjoy playing with my cats.|sd|2469
A|I don't know if you'd call that a hobby,|qy^d|2469
A|but I have two cats,|sd|2469
A|and I gave them a bath tonight,|sd|2469
A|so they're a little bit angry at me|sd|2469
B|. Can you can you put them right in the water?|qy|2469
A|They didn't like it too much.|sd|2469
A|Yeah,|ny|2469
A|oh yeah|ny|2469
B|Oh, that's good,|ba|2469
A|right in the tub,|sd|2469
A|and it helps because its the time of the year that they're shedding a lot, and cleaning cat fur off the couch and off the floor is not a hobby of mine.|sd|2469
A|So I thought, this'll help, you know, help them shed,|sd|2469
A|and sure enough, boy the fur just came off like crazy once I got them in the tub.|sd|2469
B|Oh, yeah.|b|2469
A|So, they're pretty content now,|sd|2469
A|but they were mad at me for quite a while.|sd|2469
A|They went and hid after they, after they got dried off.|sd|2469
B|Sulked for a while, huh|qy|2469
A|Yeah.|ny|2469
B|Well, I like animals,|sd|2469
B|but we don't have any yet.|sd|2469
B|We have a nine month old with another on the way|sd|2469
A|Uh-huh.|b|2469
B|and we thought, well maybe when they're a little bit bigger then we'll,|sd|2469
A|Yeah.|b|2469
B|or get into a house with a little more space.|sd|2469
B|I'd love to have, have some animals.|sd|2469
A|Uh-huh.|b|2469
B|But I like dogs|sd|2469
B|and my husband likes cats.|sd|2469
B|So we haven't reached a real agreement on that yet.|sd|2469
B|If we get a place where we can have both, it'll be great,|sd|2469
B|but until then,|%|2469
A|Yeah,|b|2469
A|I like both,|sd|2469
A|but since I'm in an apartment, I just, I don't think an apartment is big enough for a dog.|sv|2469
A|Dogs, to me, dogs need a yard, even little dogs.|sv|2469
B|Uh-huh.|b|2469
A|They just need a yard.|sv|2469
A|Cats can deal with being inside all the time just fine.|sv|2469
A|But I just think dogs need, need to be outside, though.|sv|2469
A|So,|%|2469
B|I agree with you.|aa|2469
B|I,|%|2469
B|if we were going to get anything now it would definitely be a cat, or even a bird or a fish tank or something, you know Something small|sd|2469
A|Yeah,|b|2469
A|now that's an idea|ba|2469
A|with the small babies.|%|2469
B|that she can watch, but won't take too much care.|sd|2469
A|Yeah,|b|2469
A|because, you kind of,|%|2469
A|even, even a cat, you never know when they might bite or scratch or something.|sv|2469
B|Uh-huh.|b|2469
A|There not as likely to as a dog might, I guess.|sv|2469
A|But with little ones, I'd be kind of scared to get anything that has teeth or claws.|sd|2469
B|Especially when they're not quite to the age of understanding that they're hurting, you know,|sv|2469
B|that|%|2469
B|they grab hold with both hands and then just jerk.|sv|2469
A|Oh yeah.|b|2469
B|And if I was a cat or dog, I'd respond probably by biting or something.|sd|2469
B|I don't know.|h|2469
A|Oh, yeah|b|2469
B|That'd be my self defense.|sd|2469
B|But, Well, I think we probably reached our time limit.|fc|2469
A|Uh-huh|fc|2469
A|Yeah,|fc|2469
A|probably|fc|2469
A|so, and I'm out of, out of good ideas for a hobby anyway.|fc|2469
B|Oh, okay.|fc|2469
A|Well it was good talking to you.|fc|2469
B|Thank you for calling.|fc|2469
A|All right.|fc|2469
A|Bye-bye.|fc|2469
B|Bye-bye.|fc|2469
