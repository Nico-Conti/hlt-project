A|, how do you feel about crime in the city?|qo|4023
A|You say you're from Atlanta.|sd|4023
B|Right,|aa|4023
B|I, I, I actually I live in the city|sd|4023
A|Uh-huh.|b|4023
B|and, uh, I guess it is a concern of mine, uh, you know, for my own safety.|sd|4023
A|Uh-huh.|b|4023
A|I mean, do you, do you find crime in Atlanta really|qy|4023
A|I live in Atlanta also.|sd|4023
B|Well that's right. Uh, I think it is bad in certain areas, *sv|ba|4023
A|Uh.|%|4023
B|however I think, the area that I live in it's not, uh, the crime level is not as high as it is in other areas of the, of the city.|sv|4023
A|Uh-huh.|b|4023
B|I think it seems that there's certain areas where, uh, the crime is focused uh.|sv|4023
A|Uh-huh.|b|4023
A|Well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city?|qw|4023
B|Well, I think it's, what's been happening over the last several years it seems they've been beefing up the police patrols, trying to put, put more guys, more cops, higher visibility,|sv|4023
B|and, uh, they've had some impact, but not a tremendous amount,|sv|4023
A|Uh-huh.|b|4023
B|and probably, um, they need to try to increase community involvement, that sort of thing, I think .|sv|4023
A|I probably agree with that.|aap_am|4023
B|Yeah.|b|4023
A|Uh.|%|4023
B|You know, particularly in some of the housing projects, uh, you know, that's, that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused|sv|4023
A|Uh-huh.|b|4023
B|and they've got to do more than just having, having cops there.|sv|4023
B|They've got to kind of change the way people think about it.|sv|4023
A|Yeah,|aa|4023
A|that's probably true.|aap_am|4023
A|Um, so, um, well do you think Atlanta's as bad as most other cities?|qy|4023
B|Um, well, I've been to,|%|4023
B|I'd say it's, it's probably in the top, top ten in terms of crime.|na|4023
B|Um, it's nowhere near as bad as New York City for example.|sd|4023
A|Uh-huh.|b|4023
B|Probably not, not as bad as Detroit.|sv|4023
A|Uh-huh.|b|4023
A|I don't think it's as bad as L A either.|sv|4023
B|No.|aa|4023
A|We, I don't think we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have.|sv|4023
B|Yeah,|aa|4023
B|that seems to be true.|aa|4023
B|Um, yeah,|%|4023
B|if you've ever been to like New York City|%|4023
B|and you can just, you can just, as you walk through the street on a given evening, you can see crimes being committed.|sd|4023
A|Uh-huh.|b|4023
A|Uh-huh.|b|4023
B|It's that obvious.|sd|4023
A|Yeah,|b|4023
A|I don't know,|h|4023
A|I came to the conclusion also that, you know, just, if you are walking in a downtown area, you know, where there's a lot of crime, a lot of that's going to just, just keeping your senses about you and, and trying not to look like a victim, you know.|sv|4023
B|Yeah,|aa|4023
B|that's true.|aa|4023
A|You know, walk you know, walk with, you know, with just walk in a confidently,|sv|4023
B|With a big stick|^2|4023
B|or.|qy|4023
A|and, you know, don't, don't be looking around like you've never been there before and you have no idea where you are.|sv|4023
B|Right.|b|4023
B|Sure.|ba|4023
B|Right,|aa|4023
B|don't, don't walk down a, an alley|sv|4023
B|or don't get|%|4023
A|Yeah.|b|4023
B|just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation|sv|4023
A|Uh-huh.|b|4023
B|but, yeah,|%|4023
B|there are times when you can't avoid all that|sv|4023
A|Uh.|%|4023
B|and, and then you're kind of on your own|sv|4023
A|Yeah.|b|4023
A|have you, have you ever, have you ever been mugged in Atlanta?|qy|4023
B|Uh, no.|nn|4023
B|The only thing I've ever had, was I've had my wallet lifted|sd|4023
A|Uh-huh.|b|4023
B|but that was in a more of a, a setting where there was a number of people around,|sd|4023
B|and I kind of got,|%|4023
B|I was much younger at the time|sd|4023
A|Uh-huh.|b|4023
B|and kind of a couple of people, they just took it from me without me knowing really and kind of passed it off, so I didn't know who had it.|sd|4023
A|Uh-huh.|b|4023
A|Uh-huh.|b|4023
B|I've had that happen,|sd|4023

A|Um.  Yeah,|%|4023
B|Oh, yeah.|b|4023
A|I think I've only actually seen like one, you know, one actual robbery with a gun|sd|4023
B|Um.|%|4023
A|and that's been about the only, you know, real violent crime where, you know, potentially violent crime that I've seen in Atlanta.|sd|4023
B|Really,|ba|4023
B|well, I've had my.|%|4023
A|And that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed.|sd|4023
