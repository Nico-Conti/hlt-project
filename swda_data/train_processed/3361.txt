A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3361
A|Well, Carolyn, the, uh, one of the main things I'd like, like to know is, uh, how do you feel about the, knowing about the environment of a nursing home before you would send someone there to live and so forth.|qo|3361
B|Well.|%|3361
A|What do you think would be required, and so forth?|qo|3361
B|Uh, I'll tell you,|^h|3361
B|I, I watched what went on, um, with the TWENTY TWENTY show, I don't know if you saw that a few days ago that, that talked about nursing homes,|qy^d|3361
B|and actually they specifically talked about some in the area where I am, here in Texas,|sd|3361
B|and|%|3361
A|Oh, you knew of the homes, then.|qy|3361
B|Pardon?|br|3361
A|You knew of the homes themselves?|qy|3361
B|Well, I,|%|3361
B|no,|nn|3361
B|I'm not familiar with those homes per se|sd|3361
A|Uh-huh|b|3361
B|but, um, they were in the area where I live uh,|sd|3361
A|Oh, okay.|bk|3361
B|and it was really revealing to see some of the, you know, the things that go on, I guess, in some of these homes,|sd|3361
B|so I would definitely, you know, want to really check things out and, uh, go,|sd|3361
B|I guess that the big thing would be once you got someone in a home like that, to, to make sure that you went daily, you know and made sure that they were cared for,|sv|3361
A|Yeah.|b|3361
B|and,|%|3361
A|Well, from your point of view, how would you feel about actually sending someone that, that's, you know, means something to you to one of those homes.|qw|3361
A|I realize that you indicated you wanted to check out as much as you can about it|bf|3361
B|Uh-huh.|aa|3361
A|and, of course, that makes sense,|ba|3361
A|but how do you think they would feel, I should say, about moving from where they have lived most of their life into a whole new, new home situation?|qo|3361
B|Well, actually, I have that kind of situation, because my mother lives with me,|arp_nd|3361
B|and she's eighty-seven|sd|3361
A|Uh-huh.|b|3361
A|Oh, okay.|bk|3361
B|and, uh, from the time that we were tiny, she said, you know, I want you to promise that you'll never put me in a rest home.|sd|3361
A|Uh-huh.|b|3361
B|So I know how she feels about it.|sd|3361
B|You know, if I, uh if I ever had to put her there, I think, uh, it would be probably when I just could not handle it any more, you know, if I she got to the point where she was totally bedridden, and, and I mean, I just didn't have the skills or the strength to lift her or whatever it needed,|sd|3361
A|Yes.|b|3361
A|Uh-huh.|b|3361
B|I think that would be the,|sd|3361
A|Well, how do you find that your, your personal relationship is with her, know that you're both together all the time and you are having to do a lot more for her than normal?|qo|3361
A|Does that, does that cause any problems between the two of you?|qy|3361
B|Uh, I wouldn't say any more than usual.|ng|3361
A|Uh-huh.|b|3361
A|Is she,|%|3361
B|I think it's very hard for her, um, to be waited upon, so to speak,|sd|3361
B|I mean, I think it's hard for her to have that role of not being able to do as much as she used to.|sd|3361
A|It's hard to accept the fact that you're unable to pursue life, at the level that you did before,|qy|3361
A|isn't it?|^g|3361
B|Yeah,|ny|3361
B|I think that's very true.|aa|3361
A|Yeah.|b|3361
B|Um, on the other hand, it takes on almost a, a switch of a mother child relationship.|sv|3361
A|It is different.|sv|3361
B|Uh.|b|3361
A|I had that almost similar situation.|sd|3361
A|My mother lives in an apartment with my sister|sd|3361
B|Oh.|b|3361
A|and, uh, so I, except for the three or four months this summer,|sd|3361
A|that's the only time I ever spent with my mother,|sd|3361
A|and, of course, since I see her only once or twice a year, I was just thrilled to have her here with me,|sd|3361
B|Uh-huh.|b|3361
A|and I spent every minute I could to be with her and, uh, cooking foods for her, you know, just to make her, her life as though she were on vacation.|sd|3361
B|Uh-huh.|b|3361
A|But somehow another, it, that doesn't work between my mom and my sister,|sd|3361
A|and they, they find they, they are,|sd|3361
A|in speaking they,|%|3361
A|I don't know,|h|3361
A|my mother feels uncomfortable around my sister,|sd|3361
A|and my sister's uncomfortable because her mother's there|sd|3361
B|Uh-huh.|b|3361
A|and I guess it's just because they're there all the time.|sv|3361
B|Yeah.|b|3361
A|So it's, it puts, has put pressure on both of them from that point of view.|sd|3361
A|So that's, that's kind of bad news.|ba|3361
A|And by the same token, my wife's mother is now moved into a nursing home,|sd|3361
A|and after all she has been a farmer's wife for sixty years|sd|3361
B|Um.|b|3361
A|and now all of a sudden she's had to move off of her farm, into another home where the environment is totally different.|sd|3361
B|Uh-huh.|b|3361
A|She's relatively happy,|sd|3361
A|but she doesn't like the food.|sd|3361
A|And when she complains about the food then they kind of get angry with her.|sd|3361
B|Huh.|b|3361
B|Uh-huh.|b|3361
A|So, that's another one of those things you have to solve.|sv|3361
B|Yeah.|b|3361
B|Well, that's got to be a big adjustment for someone that's, as you say, lived on a farm for sixty years,|sv|3361
B|and then go to something like that.|sv|3361
A|Yeah,|aa|3361
A|after all, their, their life is so totally different|sv|3361
A|because in those early days, the food, they had to make it from scratch, so to speak.|sd|3361
B|Uh-huh.|b|3361
A|I mean, you raised your own chickens,|sd|3361
A|and you killed your own hogs, I suppose,|sd|3361
A|and then they they had to store the meat in, uh,|sd|3361
B|Yeah.|b|3361
A|I don't want to say barns,|sd|3361
A|but they had regular little places they, they would hang it, you know to cure it and so forth.|sd|3361
B|Uh-huh.|b|3361
A|And, and now, all of a sudden, it, uh, comes in differently,|sd|3361
A|it tastes differently.|sd|3361
B|That's right.|aa|3361
B|Yeah.|b|3361
