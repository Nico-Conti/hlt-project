A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3343
A|When they first said the subject, my mind went kind of blank.|sd|3343
A|I thought, Gee, I haven't taken anything back for a long time.|sd|3343
B|Well, I haven't either, uh,|sd|3343
B|I, I hate returning things.|sd|3343
A|Yeah.|b|3343
B|I mean, I, I have a friend who, if she likes something, isn't sure what size somebody might need, will buy it in every color and size and, you know, take everything back again|sd|3343
A|Yeah.|b|3343
B|It's, you know, it's a game to her,|sd|3343
B|but I, I do not like to do that|sd|3343
B|I consider it kind of a, a waste of my time.|sd|3343
B|And so I'm usually, uh, pretty careful when I shop|sd|3343
A|Uh-huh.|b|3343
B|and I also, you know, usually have, have checked over things, you know, if it's like an appliance or something to make sure, uh, it has the features in it that I want.|sd|3343
A|Right.|b|3343
B|Now we've had one lately, um, oh, a, uh, a Dustbuster Plus that we bought,|sd|3343
A|Uh-huh.|b|3343
B|and we've had it for a while,|sd|3343
B|but all of a sudden it just wasn't working,|sd|3343
B|and it looks like there's a part missing from it.|sd|3343
B|My husband opened it up and whatever,|sd|3343
B|and of course we don't have the receipt any more,|sd|3343
B|so we can't take it back|sd|3343
A|Of course,|ba|3343
A|uh-huh.|%|3343
B|Uh, but, I think a lot of goods are made not to last real long|sv|3343
A|Right|aa|3343
B|uh,|%|3343
A|right,|aa|3343
A|just to get you by five years|sv|3343
A|and then you'll throw it away rather than have it fixed|sv|3343
B|Yeah.|b|3343
A|We're, we're a wasteful society, for sure.|sv|3343
B|Well, that's true,|aa|3343
B|and lot of times though, it is, it costs so much to get something fixed that you almost are just as well off buying another one you know, if it's,|sv|3343
A|Right.|b|3343
A|Right.|b|3343
A|And you usually get what you pay for.|sv|3343
A|We bought some walkie-talkies a couple of years ago for Christmas,|sd|3343
A|and they were like ten dollars,|sd|3343
A|and we expected them to work nice for the little kids,|sd|3343
A|and they didn't work worth anything|sd|3343
B|Uh-huh.|b|3343
A|So we took those back,|sd|3343
A|and that's about that|sd|3343
A|all that were taken back in ages.|sd|3343
B|Well, yeah,|b|3343
B|I think a lot of times, if you get a brand name uh, you know, if it's a, a good brand,|sv|3343
A|Yeah.|b|3343
B|I, you, I think there's, there can be a lemon in anything but, uh, I think more often than not,|sv|3343
A|Right.|b|3343
B|you, you pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time,|sv|3343
B|and, uh you know, if you buy a good one, you shouldn't have any, you know, too much of a problem with it,|sv|3343
A|Right.|b|3343
B|I mean, we, we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law which is extremely difficult to do.|sd|3343
A|Oh, really.|b|3343
A|It's hard.|^2|3343
B|We never could get it declared a lemon,|sd|3343
B|and the car would go|sd|3343
B|and, without any warning whatsoever, you could be going down the freeway at sixty|sd|3343
B|and it would stop|sd|3343
A|Oh, wow.|ba|3343
B|and I,|%|3343
B|there was just,|%|3343
B|you know, and, oh, we went round and round with the manufacturer and, and everything,|sd|3343
B|and they got it finally semifixed,|sd|3343
B|but it was such a hassle|sd|3343
A|Uh-huh,|b|3343
A|and it just pertained to that|qy^d|3343
B|yeah,|ny|3343
B|yeah|ny|3343
B|it, it really is, uh,|sd|3343
B|but, gee, this is, of all the topics I have had, I'm doing this thing, this is kind of the strangest one.|sd|3343
A|I, at first I thought of food, you know, because that's what, mainly what I buy,|sd|3343
A|it seems like,|sd|3343
A|and, uh, you know, I still don't have any, anything to do there,|sd|3343
A|but, But I, I think, too, a lot of people don't buy their warranties either because they know that when it's that old they're going to buy a new one,|sv|3343
B|Uh-huh.|b|3343
A|so.|%|3343
B|Well, I think that's true,|aa|3343
B|and I, uh, now we generally don't buy a warranty, because you think, you know, at least for the first couple of years, nothing should go wrong with it.|sd|3343
A|Yeah,|aa|3343
A|my husband is really good at fixing things, too,|sd|3343
A|so he usually, be able to fix anything that's minor,|sd|3343
A|and and that has saved us thousands of dollars, you know, from to mechanic to anything like that|sd|3343
B|Uh-huh.|b|3343
B|Uh-huh.|b|3343
B|Uh-huh.|b|3343
A|but, but, it was interesting to,|%|3343
A|I don't know if they're making them better or not,|sd|3343
A|I, it's hard to say.|sv|3343
A|Some, I think they more of their parts plastic, which, you know, makes things break easier,|sv|3343
A|but I think the technology is better.|sv|3343
B|I think technology is better,|aa|3343
B|I'm, I'm not sure.|h|3343
B|I think you've got a good point with the plastic and that.|sv|3343
A|About quality.|sv|3343
B|I don't think necessarily that, things are being made better uh, you know,|sv|3343
A|Right.|b|3343
B|I, I,|%|3343
B|everything is so automated, uh,|sv|3343
B|and things can be made without, I think a human hand ever touching it, you know an awful lot of things,|sv|3343
A|Yeah,|b|3343
A|Yeah.|b|3343
B|and I think that certainly makes a difference from, back from the time when somebody handcrafted something and, you know, had some pride in it.|sv|3343
A|Right.|aa|3343
A|Well, people aren't willing to pay those prices very often, so, you know, for a handcrafted something,|sv|3343
A|so|%|3343
B|Well, yeah,|aa|3343
B|that's that's true.|aa|3343
A|so.|%|3343
A|So, if we get what we what we deserve|sv|3343
B|Yeah,|b|3343
B|well, I, I do, uh, you know, craft work and sell stuff at shows|sd|3343
B|and that, and uh, uh, you know, it's, it's, it's a real eye-opener as far as, you know, why people charge what they do to, you know.|sd|3343
