A|We're supposed to talk about crime in the city.|sd|3320
B|Uh-huh.|b|3320
A|And, uh, seems like all big cities have plenty of that nowadays, doesn't it?|qy|3320
B|Well, uh, I,|%|3320
B|that's,|%|3320
B|sure.|na|3320
B|Uh, I, I think it's|%|3320
B|statistics, obviously, vary greatly.|sv|3320
B|I always thought of Dallas as being a fairly safe place.|sv|3320
A|Well, it is,|aa|3320
A|but our crimes up here, uh, as I think it must be in most cities now,|sv|3320
A|but, uh, I was listening to the news the other day|sd|3320
A|and they said they thought a lot of it, the reason it was up so was because of the, uh, so many people are without work nowadays,|sd|3320
A|economy's so bad|sd|3320
B|Do you really believe that?|qy|3320
B|I mean, it, it's been up every year for many years|sv|3320
B|and the economy hasn't been, this bad for so long, has it?|qy|3320
A|That's a good point|ba|3320
A|That's just what they quoted over the news.|sd|3320
B|Yeah.|b|3320
A|I don't know if I believe that or not,|no|3320
A|but, it, it does seem up|sv|3320
A|and,|%|3320
B|What kind of newspaper do you get down there?|qw|3320
A|What kind?|qw|3320
B|Yeah.|ny|3320
A|Well, we got a, I think we got a pretty good newspaper.|sd|3320
A|Uh, we have two, the MORNING NEWS and the, uh, TIMES HERALD.|sd|3320
B|Uh-huh.|b|3320
A|MORNING NEWS seems to have the largest circulation.|sd|3320
A|I think it's a pretty good,|sd|3320
A|it's a locally owned paper.|sd|3320
B|Uh-huh.|b|3320
A|The HERALD is owned, I think, by the TIMES out of, uh, L A, or somewhere.|sd|3320
B|Yes.|b|3320
A|But,|%|3320
B|do they, do they play up the local crime angles|qy|3320
B|or or do they,|%|3320
A|Well, they don't,|ng|3320
A|no,|nn|3320
A|not really, uh,|sd|3320
A|they don't play it up, I don't think.|sd|3320
A|Uh, but there, there is too much of it, you know, uh too many homes broken into.|sd|3320
B|Uh-huh.|b|3320
B|Yeah.|b|3320
A|We had our, our, fact about, uh,|%|3320
A|last year sometime our home was broken into.|sd|3320
B|Really?|bh|3320
A|We,|%|3320
B|So this is a topic of personal interest.|qy^d|3320
A|Yeah,|ny|3320
A|we, uh, uh,|%|3320
A|I didn't think ours ever would be burgled into, burgled,|sd|3320
A|but, so many in our neighborhood had been,|sd|3320
A|and, uh, because we live on a corner and back up to a real, uh, highly traveled main street.|sd|3320
B|Uh-huh.|b|3320
B|Yeah.|b|3320
A|But, uh, we were, so, uh,|%|3320
B|So, so you saw this happening in your neighborhood|bf|3320
B|and you figured it wouldn't happen to you.|bf|3320
A|Sort of, yeah.|aa|3320
A|And I never did get a security system,|sd|3320
A|but since that happened, I certainly have.|sd|3320
B|Yeah,|b|3320
B|what kind of system do you have?|qw|3320
A|It's, uh, uh, I guess excuse me, just a standard. Uh, with the, uh, all the doors and the, uh, infrared thing, you know, motion detector. Pretty standard.|sd|3320
B|Uh-huh.|b|3320
B|Is, Is this, is this one with some company that, that services you and takes your calls and all that stuff?|qy|3320
A|Yes,|ny|3320
A|yes.|ny|3320
A|It's monitored and all that.|sd|3320
B|Yeah.|b|3320
A|And,|%|3320
B|Well, is that a necessary feature to have somebody, you know, at the other end of the line|qy|3320
B|or is it enough just to have a thing that makes loud noise?|qrr|3320
A|I think, uh, the thing that makes a lot of noise would, would suffice.|sv|3320
B|Yeah.|b|3320
A|I really do.|sv|3320
A|But, uh, this deal that was part of it for, you know, three years or so to pay the unit off or whatever.|sd|3320
B|Yeah.|b|3320
B|Uh-huh.|b|3320
A|And, uh, but it, uh,|%|3320
A|the monitoring is not that bad, though|sd|3320
A|because, uh, uh, we've goofed it up, you know,|sd|3320
A|several times you'll hit the wrong key, not intentionally or something|sd|3320
A|and and they call back pretty quickly,|sd|3320
A|so I guess it's, you know, I think it's all right.|sd|3320
A|But I,|%|3320
A|to answer your question, I think, uh uh, I think, uh, that is a pretty good deterrent in itself,|sv|3320
B|Yeah.|b|3320
A|whether it,|%|3320
B|so you got a sign up there that says you got this alarm system|qy^d|3320
A|Uh-huh.|qy|3320
B|And what if a burglar comes along and cuts your phone line?|qw|3320
A|Well, it's got a back up system that doesn't work supposedly. uh, that if it's cut supposedly it notifies them anyway Supposedly.|sd|3320
B|How does it do that?|qw|3320
A|Who knows, you know.|no|3320
A|But that's a selling point.|sv|3320
A|And I think they're probably, I think it probably does these things or supposedly pretty good.|sd|3320
B|Uh-huh.|b|3320
A|Boy, they sure advertise them, you know, so many of them nowadays.|sv|3320
B|Sure.|aa|3320
A|But, uh, well don't, don't you all have a pretty high crime rate up there?|qy|3320
B|Well, yeah, uh,|ny|3320
A|I'm not saying it's any higher than anybody else's.|sd|3320
A|Down here, we seem to,|sd|3320
A|or, or not here,|%|3320
A|but the statistics seem to say that.|sv|3320
A|I don't know.|h|3320
B|I, I think it's the murder capital of the country now.|sv|3320
A|Is that right?|bh|3320
B|Yes.|ny|3320
A|I would gather probably from drugs.|sv|3320
B|Absolutely.|aa|3320
A|And I think that's the reason it's so high everywhere.|sv|3320
B|Yeah.|b|3320
A|But, I don't think there's anyplace,|sv|3320
A|used to,|%|3320
A|years ago, you thought, well, these little small cities and all, wouldn't have that problem,|sv|3320
A|but they do.|sv|3320
B|Yeah.|b|3320
A|We've had relatives that their children were just as involved in it, uh, as anyone, you know.|sd|3320
B|so, what's the solution?|qh|3320
A|That's a good question.|ba|3320
A|I don't know,|no|3320
A|I don't know what the solution is.|no|3320
A|I really don't.|no|3320
B|And all these politicians make, make hay over, you know being anticrime,|sv|3320
A|Yeah.|b|3320
B|but they haven't seemed to have changed anything.|sv|3320
A|Yep.|b|3320
A|and nothing seems to change.|sv|3320
A|And, uh, I'm not sure that anything will because these, if something could happen to make these people not want to buy it|sv|3320
B|Uh-huh.|b|3320
A|uh, but, they want to buy it,|sv|3320
A|so,|%|3320
B|Yeah.|b|3320
A|Supply and demand.|sv|3320
A|Long as somebody wants to buy it, somebody going to provide it for them|sv|3320
A|So, I don't know, I don't got, you know, I don't know what the solution is,|sd|3320
A|I really don't|sd|3320
B|Yeah.|b|3320
A|I don't think anyone does, in fact.|sv|3320
B|Yeah,|b|3320
B|what,|%|3320
