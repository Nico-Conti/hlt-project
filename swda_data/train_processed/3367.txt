A|What?|br|3367
A|Do you want to start?|qy|3367
B|Uh, you hit, you hit, uh,|sd|3367
B|it doesn't matter.|sd|3367
B|Um, we're discussing the capital punishment, I believe.|sd|3367
A|Right.|b|3367
A|You are right.|sd|3367
A|Yeah.|%|3367
A|I, I suppose I should have,|sv|3367
B|Uh, which|%|3367
B|I am, am pro capital punishment except that I don't like the way it's done.|sd|3367
A|Uh-huh.|b|3367
A|Uh, yeah,|^h|3367
A|uh, I, uh, I guess, I, I hate to see anyone die, uh|sd|3367
B|Uh-huh.|b|3367
A|but, uh, I guess these people that go around and, and kill children and women and everything else without any remorse, uh, I don't think they deserve to, to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives.|sv|3367
B|I, I agree.|aa|3367
B|I, I'm,|%|3367
B|capital|%|3367
B|the, the,|%|3367
B|capital punishment is necessary in, in many cases|sv|3367
B|but, uh, the,|%|3367
B|it's not a deterrent, um, or our jails would not be so full.|sv|3367
B|There wouldn't be so many people in Death Row.|sv|3367
A|Uh-huh.|b|3367
B|I think it needs to be something, uh, uh, a throwback to where they did a, uh, public execution where it's visible.|sv|3367
A|Yeah.|b|3367
B|Uh, something, you know, not gruesome|sv|3367
B|but, but something more where people know that it, it was a deterrent and it was equal for all people.|sv|3367
B|If you committed a certain crime, you were going to receive a death penalty|sv|3367
B|and it was going to happen to you.|sv|3367
A|Yeah.|b|3367
B|No stays of execution.|sv|3367
B|No, no loopholes,|sv|3367
B|no,|%|3367
A|Well, and even, even that I don't really know if that would help.|sv|3367
A|I think a lot of these people do it, uh, mainly because of, of T V|sv|3367
A|and,|%|3367
B|Notoriety.|bf|3367
A|the double reason they, they see it being done on T V and also the fact of, of notoriety.|sv|3367
A|I mean, they become well known.|sv|3367
A|They are almost like, like a big star.|sv|3367
B|yes,|b|3367
B|but, but they, they know that their chances of actually receiving the death penalty are minimal.|sv|3367
A|Yeah.|b|3367
B|They know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years.|sv|3367
A|Uh-huh.|b|3367
B|That they are going to write a book.|sv|3367
B|They are going to go on talk shows|sv|3367
B|they're|%|3367
B|that, that, that's a reward uh, for a heinous crime rather than, uh, having them pay the penalty which is forfeiture of their life.|sv|3367
A|Yeah.|b|3367
A|Right.|b|3367
B|In, in complete, uh,|%|3367
B|of any notoriety.|sv|3367
A|Yeah.|b|3367
A|Well, I, I, I think if they went according to, uh, the BIBLE where it does say, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life,|sv|3367
B|Uh-huh.|b|3367
B|Right.|b|3367
A|uh, you take a life you give yours.|sv|3367
B|Right.|b|3367
A|Uh, uh, that's for sure.|ba|3367
A|Uh, there's exceptions to the rule|sv|3367
A|I mean if, if it's an accidental taking then, uh, you look at that|sv|3367
A|but, you know, most of these people that down right go right and, and do it out of pure pleasure uh, I don't, uh, like to see that.|sv|3367
B|Uh-huh.|b|3367
A|I guess also the fact that they say it's not a deterrent,|sv|3367
A|it is a deterrent in the, in the sense that that person will never do it again|sv|3367
B|Well, yes,|ar|3367
B|they will.|sd|3367
A|Not, not, not if he's killed he can't, do it again.|sv|3367
B|It,|%|3367
B|Oh, ,|b|3367
B|well, that's correct,|ba|3367
B|yes.|b|3367
B|if, if he indeed receives the death penalty and it is, it is executed.|sv|3367
A|The death penalty.|b^m|3367
A|Uh-huh.|b|3367
B|Yeah.|b|3367
B|But, but the, the, the chances are not great that that will happen.|sv|3367
A|Right.|b|3367
B|But there's a greater chance that he'll be back out on the streets in twelve years.|sv|3367
A|Uh-huh,|b|3367
A|yeah.|b|3367
A|Well, I, I guess I'm also looking at beyond even that.|sd|3367
A|I, I, I guess I been thinking about it|sd|3367
A|and I don't have a definite opinion|sd|3367
A|but, uh, repeat, uh, crimes uh, maybe not the, the more mild ones but, you know, a more severe ones especially on, on armed robbery and stuff where they been taking from elderly people, and not just taking the money but beating them half to death.|sv|3367
B|Uh-huh.|b|3367
B|Uh-huh.|b|3367
B|That's right.|ba|3367
A|Just for pleasure too|^2|3367
A|and I guess you've got to look at something like that.|sv|3367
B|Yes.|aa|3367
A|Do they deserve to, uh, remain on this earth too?|bh|3367
B|Why, you know, you could carry it to that if, uh, if they are a repeat offender|sv|3367
B|and, and you know that as soon as you let them out on the streets they are going to do this.|sv|3367
B|Unfortunately the way our system of jurisprudence is set up, um, you only receive the death penalty for capital crimes,|sv|3367
A|Right.|b|3367
B|and of course uh, of battery or assault or, that is not a capital crime see.|sd|3367
B|You, you wouldn't be able to under our system.|sd|3367
A|Right.|b|3367
B|Now China and a few other countries have a little different view of that.|sv|3367
B|Um, you get caught with dope there and you die, period.|sv|3367
A|Yeah.|b|3367
A|Uh-huh.|b|3367
B|There is, there is no, no appeals.|sv|3367
B|There is no,|%|3367
