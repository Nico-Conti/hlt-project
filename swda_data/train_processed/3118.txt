A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3118
A|do you want to start?|qy|3118
B|Okay,|aa|3118
B|uh, I haven't, I don't know that much about the what the possible choices could be about reorganizing the trial by jury,|sd|3118
B|but, uh, I think it works better than many other systems, like having a judge decide.|sv|3118
A|Uh-huh.|b|3118
B|I can't think of many alternatives that could be more fair than having twelve people decide, although it's difficult because they all have to be unanimous.|sv|3118
A|Now that, do you, do you agree, that they should all be unanimous?|qy|3118
B|I don't,|%|3118
A|Or even, even in, uh, like they said, you know, lesser, you know, trials, you know, lesser convictions, do you think that they should be all unanimous still?|qrr|3118
B|I don't know,|no|3118
B|I don't know if I feel, I don't feel real strongly about that.|sd|3118
B|If the, uh,|%|3118
B|the thing is, though, I, I didn't think even if it was a lower conviction, I didn't think that you could, uh, I didn't think that you really had to have a, a jury|sd|3118
A|Uh-huh.|b|3118
B|Unless, I guess, if you request one you can.|sd|3118
B|But I think,|%|3118
B|yeah,|%|3118
B|making it unanimous sometimes might, uh, let, the only thing, it might let more people get off.|sv|3118
B|I don't think it would convict any more people.|sv|3118
A|Uh-huh.|b|3118
B|And we have so many people already, you know,|sv|3118
B|the jails are already overloaded.|sv|3118
A|Well, the thing is they stay until they all are unanimous.|sd|3118
A|I mean if one is determined that it's, you know, that he feels that he's, you know, going against the other eleven, they all stay until everyone agrees.|sd|3118
A|So I don't know if it would leave anyone getting off more unless someone just gets tired of fighting, you know, just gives in.|sv|3118
B|Yeah.|b|3118
B|Well, if it's,|%|3118
B|no,|ar|3118
B|but they, they, what if they never agree.|qw|3118
B|Doesn't it just, uh, do they have to go back and do a whole new trial|qy|3118
B|or,|%|3118
A|And they have to stay in until they all agree|sd|3118
B|Agree|b^m|3118
A|yeah.|b|3118
A|I don't know,|h|3118
A|I'm not sure if they go, I mean to twelve new people or what they do exactly,|sd|3118
A|but I do know for sure that all twelve have to agree before he can either, you know, either he or she can either go free or to jail, either one.|sd|3118
B|Yeah,|b|3118
B|and that maybe on the lesser crimes that aren't too severe, that's a little stringent|sv|3118
A|Uh-huh.|b|3118
B|Especially because there's twelve.|sv|3118
B|The thing about it is, I think jury selection, too,|%|3118
B|a lot of times, uh, the lawyers are able to pick and choose who they want on the jury|sv|3118
B|and they can sway them that way, too.|sv|3118
A|That's, that's just it.|sd|3118
A|I don't understand.|sd|3118
A|You're supposed to, you know, go in if you have, you know, like if you've never heard of the people before or anything,|sv|3118
A|but I don't understand with racialism and the way religion is and everything else how you can get people that are total, totally impartial to it.|qh|3118
B|I know.|aa|3118
B|I don't think, well, I guess you really can't,|sv|3118
B|but the other thing is when they have the sensational trials, how they get people who aren't swayed by the news either.|qh|3118
A|Uh-huh.|b|3118
B|So, uh, but then, again, you know, they, the, one of the questions they asked is, should it just be decided by a judge|sd|3118
B|and that's kind of tricky, too, because a lot of positions the judges are in, they, they can't be fired, you know,|sv|3118
B|they have to, they stay till they retire|sv|3118
A|Uh-huh.|b|3118
B|and sometimes they're pretty partial in their judgements, too|sv|3118
A|Yeah,|aa|3118
A|I agree.|aa|3118
A|I don't think it should be left up to the judge alone.|sv|3118
A|Not only, you know, that they have to stay in there,|sd|3118
A|but, hey,|ba|3118
A|how many times have you heard of judges being bought over.|qh|3118
B|I know.|aa|3118
A|You know, so it, it's, I, I think, I think in, in the end, the judge has the presiding, you know, uh, vote.|sv|3118
A|I think he can be, you know, I, I don't know if it's the way it is in real life,|sv|3118
A|but I've seen it on T V where the juries go one way|sd|3118
A|and the judge totally finds it obnoxious|sd|3118
A|and he completely, you know, goes the other way.|sd|3118
B|Yeah.|b|3118
A|Now, I'm not sure if the judge is allowed to do that in everyday life or what.|sd|3118
B|I think in some cases they are.|sd|3118
A|Uh-huh.|b|3118
B|But they know they get to decide how severe the sentence is if it's, you know,|sv|3118
A|Yeah.|b|3118
B|so that's another thing where they have the power,|sv|3118
B|but maybe juries could be less than twelve people|sd|3118
B|or would that be more fair or less fair.|qh|3118
B|Maybe there should be more than twelve people|sv|3118
B|I don't,|%|3118
A|Oh, oh, my God.|ba|3118
A|If there were more than twelve, can you imagine how long they'd be sitting|sv|3118
B|I know.|aa|3118
B|I don't know.|h|3118
A|I, I think it's just, I don't, I mean, I think it's as fair as it can possibly get,|sv|3118
A|but I just think it's really you know,|sv|3118
A|I mean, some cases go on for years, you know.|sd|3118
B|That's true,|aa|3118
B|and I've never been on jury duty,|sd|3118
B|but they have to keep going and going and going. And lose their, not lose their jobs, but not go to work.|sd|3118
A|Uh-huh.|b|3118
A|Yeah.|b|3118
A|I, I don't know how it could be more fair.|sd|3118
A|Course, I don't know.|h|3118
A|Maybe maybe they should be asking someone that's been on, on trial before.|sv|3118
B|It could be,|sv|3118
B|Really,|aa|3118
B|I've never seen one in real life either|sd|3118
B|so I don't have, you know, I don't know that much about it,|sd|3118
B|but I think, it seems that we have a, a pretty fair system compared to other countries.|sv|3118
B|I don't know how we could make it more fair.|sd|3118
B|I really don't.|sd|3118
A|Uh-huh.|b|3118
B|The unanimous vote is questionable, though.|sv|3118
B|And, and how, how many cases get juries might want to be reviewed, too.|sv|3118
A|Uh-huh.|b|3118
A|Yeah.|b|3118
B|Because, uh, I don't know if you should really have a jury for a small infraction.|sv|3118
B|But I'm not sure who gets them|sd|3118
A|Uh-huh.|b|3118
B|I don't know anything|sd|3118
A|I know.|b|3118
A|I don't know that much about it either.|sd|3118
A|I just, I don't know.|h|3118
A|I, I guess maybe if they'd go and they'd ask someone in jail, you know, how they can make it more fair for them or not,|sv|3118
A|but then again, maybe they should be there|sv|3118
A|so that is fair.|sv|3118
B|Right.|b|3118
A|I don't, I, I don't think anyone's going to come up with a better way.|sv|3118
B|No,|aa|3118
B|whoever came up with this was pretty smart because it was pretty, uh, unique I think, when they started it.|sv|3118
A|Uh-huh.|b|3118
A|Yeah.|b|3118
B|So, how long do we need to talk?|qw|3118
B|Do you know?|qy|3118
A|Oh, I think we can hang up anytime|sd|3118
B|Okay.|bk|3118
B|Uh, in, uh,|%|3118
B|what do I do now?|fc|3118
B|Do you know?|fc|3118
B|Anything,|fc|3118
B|or just wait for someone else.|fc|3118
A|No,|fc|3118
A|I don't|fc|3118
A|what else to say,|%|3118
A|so.|%|3118
B|Okay,|fc|3118
B|well it was nice talking with you.|fc|3118
A|It was nice talking to you, too.|fc|3118
A|Bye.|fc|3118
B|Thanks.|fc|3118
B|Bye-bye.|fc|3118
