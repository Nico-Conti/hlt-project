A|Well, the question was talking about the juries|sd|4697
A|and, uh, one of the things I thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having, that, especially for repeat offenders that, uh,|sd|4697
A|maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again.|sv|4697
A|Uh, so that, uh, a judge, I think, would be the most appropriate person to, uh, to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day. Right. *slash error should be 'aa'|sv|4697
B|Right.|aa|4697
B|I, I kind of agree with that, because I think in some cases, uh, the jury may not even have, the information about other crimes the person has committed.|sv|4697
B|Uh, I, I think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the current case|sv|4697
A|Right|aa|4697
B|so a judge, you're right, should have the whole dossier of the criminal there|sv|4697
A|Uh-huh.|b|4697
B|and if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better position to give an appropriate, uh, sentencing.|sv|4697
A|Yeah.|aa|4697
A|See I agree with you.|aa|4697
A|Uh, one thing I heard was this, where they have, instead of going to the regular court, they have a, a mock court.|sd|4697
A|I mean, it's supposed to be all legal and everything.|sd|4697
A|Uh, you go|sd|4697
A|and you present your case,|sd|4697
A|the other side presents their case|sd|4697
A|and you're done with it.|sd|4697
A|It's almost like the NIGHT COURT we see on T V.|sd|4697
B|Uh-huh.|b|4697
A|Uh, and, uh, but it's not that we have, uh, such,|%|4697
A|it didn't backlog or all of the, uh, the cases that are, uh, all ready pending.|sd|4697
A|Uh, so I,|%|4697
A|that was one thing I thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way.|sv|4697
B|In other words, not, not,|%|4697
B|there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial?|qy|4697
A|Yes.|ny|4697
A|Now,|%|4697
B|I, I, I don't,|arp_nd|4697
B|there's a point on which we don't agree.|ar|4697
A|Uh-huh.|b|4697
B|I would tend, myself, to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a, anytime a, one of the parties wants one.|sv|4697
A|Uh-huh.|b|4697
B|And I, usually it is the defendant, I guess, that wants to have the jury hear the case.|sv|4697
A|Sure.|b|4697
B|So I'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we, uh, take that, you know,|sv|4697
B|that would require a change in the Bill of Rights, I believe|sv|4697
B|and so,|%|4697
A|and, and I wasn't, I didn't mean that|sd|4697
B|Oh, oh, okay.|bk|4697
A|I, I didn't mean that, no.|sd|4697
A|Because, I mean, gee whiz, if I was, uh, uh, didn't have that right, you know, not to have a jury that, oh|sv|4697
A|yes, I would feel, uh, you're right, that my civil rights had been violated.|sv|4697
A|But I meant for some, when both parties agreed that yes, we're going to have a judge here.|sv|4697
A|We're not going to have a jury, you know,|sv|4697
A|let's get it over with.|sv|4697
A|Sort of like car accidents, you know,|sv|4697
B|Right.|aa|4697
B|Well I think that's all ready possible.|sv|4697
A|Yeah.|b|4697
B|I think, that you can waive the right to a, jury trial uh,|sv|4697
B|yeah|%|4697
A|right|aa|4697
B|so. I agree that that should be encouraged.|aa|4697
A|Uh-huh.|b|4697
B|People should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial.|sv|4697
B|But I think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to, to clients unless they feel they can, you know, tweak a jury into  giving a different sentence or possibly, if it's a civil case, giving higher, uh, you know, awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the, the award.|sv|4697
A|Right.|aa|4697
A|Giving a different sentence.|^2|4697
A|Uh-huh.|b|4697
A|The take.|sv|4697
A|Right.|aa|4697
B|Yeah.|aa|4697
B|And I suspect it, in cases like,|%|4697
B|I guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though, rather than civil.|sd|4697
B|Is that right?|qy|4697
A|Well, I, I, we're at liberty to, to talk and, and meander as long as it's all on the same theme.|no|4697
B|Yeah.|b|4697
A|Uh-huh.|b|4697
B|Well, uh, in the case of, civil, uh, things, I think maybe the, the use of the jury is very, often to the lawyer's advantage|sv|4697
B|and I think that may be where jury use is overdone,|sv|4697
B|I mean there are cases where they could be settled,  maybe  out of court a little more efficiently.|sv|4697
A|Right.|aa|4697
B|But the lawyers are really, uh,|%|4697
B|it's to their advantage to play to as big an audience as possible|sv|4697
B|so. Uh, I was wondering too, if they were thinking of about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in, in a criminal cases.|sd|4697
A|Uh-huh.|b|4697
A|Uh-huh.|b|4697
B|Uh, I'm not so sure I'm in favor of that.|sv|4697
B|But I am in favor of it for criminal cases|sv|4697
B|so there's a difference of my view there for those two.|sd|4697
A|Right.|aa|4697
A|Right.|aa|4697
A|Yeah,|aa|4697
A|well you can tell I haven't been in too many juries judges chambers or anything like that|sd|4697
B|Have you ever had to serve jury duty?|qy|4697
A|well I was called once when I was nineteen|no|4697
B|Uh-huh.|b|4697
A|and, uh, but I was doing so many other things that they took pity on me|sd|4697
A|and, I was doing school and things like|sd|4697
A|they, they let me out.|sd|4697
B|Uh-huh.|b|4697
A|I've never had to it since|sd|4697
A|and that was almost twenty years ago|sd|4697
B|Uh-huh.|b|4697
B|It isn't,|%|4697
B|sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time, in, uh,|sd|4697
B|that would have been about, uh, twenty years too|sd|4697
B|uh, uh, just last year|sd|4697
B|and, uh, the case I heard was a criminal case|sd|4697
B|and it seemed it really, trivial.|sd|4697
B|It involved two bicycles.|sd|4697
B|We didn't do the sentencing.|sd|4697
B|The judge did.|sd|4697
A|Huh.|b|4697
B|So|%|4697
A|How interesting.|ba|4697
B|we, we rendered a verdict|sd|4697
B|and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing.|sd|4697
A|Uh-huh,|b|4697
A|Uh-huh|b|4697
B|And that was here in Wisconsin.|sd|4697
B|So I, I don't know if that varies from state to state or if it,|sd|4697
