A|All right.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|2295
A|Well, on this subject, I really hadn't had to deal with putting someone in there yet,|sd|2295
A|but my mother's always been administrator of a nursing home|sd|2295
B|Uh-huh.|b|2295
A|so I've always been involved, you know, in one.|sd|2295
B|How do you feel about them, I mean, since you've kind of been close to that.|qo|2295
A|Well, I've Well, I can kind of see both sides, you know,|sd|2295
A|I really can.|sd|2295
A|Uh, nursing homes to me,|%|2295
A|I would personally be the last resort you know, I you know if I had to put someone in there.|sd|2295
B|Uh-huh.|b|2295
B|Well, I've had a touch of experience.|sd|2295
B|My, um, dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother couldn't take care of him|sd|2295
A|Yeah,|aa|2295
A|if it's a have to thing,|sv|2295
A|yeah,|aa|2295
A|I,|%|2295
A|yeah.|aa|2295
B|and, uh, she put him in,|sd|2295
B|but he wasn't there very long before he died|sd|2295
A|Uh-huh.|b|2295
B|but, um, I guess, um, the one time that I saw him there, you know, as far as the surroundings, that seemed okay.|sd|2295
A|Uh-huh.|b|2295
B|But, um, we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of, you know keep him real out of it all the time|sd|2295
A|Yeah.|b|2295
A|Yeah.|b|2295
B|and that's always kind of bothered me.|sd|2295
A|Yeah.|aa|2295
B|Uh-huh.|b|2295
A|that's like everything else, though.|sv|2295
B|I have a sister-in-law who runs a nursing home,|sd|2295
B|but I've never actually been there|sd|2295
A|Uh-huh.|b|2295
B|and I know that she's the kind of person who wouldn't allow, you know, a lot of the horror things to take place that you hear about.|sd|2295
A|Yeah.|b|2295
A|Yeah,|arp_nd|2295
A|but,|%|2295
B|But still I'm sure there are, you know, aspects to it that aren't really desirable.|sv|2295
A|Yeah.|b|2295
A|Yeah.|b|2295
A|Yeah,|aa|2295
A|I know,|sv|2295
A|I've always,|%|2295
A|well, my sister's involved in one also,|sd|2295
A|and I really think they really do a wonderful job.|sv|2295
A|But still there's those little things that happens, you know|sv|2295
B|Yeah.|b|2295
A|there really is, which|sv|2295
A|I think, it's a wonderful place, you know, if it comes to that, you know, if you just can't take care of them any more.|sv|2295
B|Well, sometimes you don't have any other alternative|sv|2295
A|Uh-huh,|b|2295
A|that's it.|aa|2295
B|family and friends are usually, well family's tied up with their own lives and things, and usually working|sv|2295
A|Uh-huh.|b|2295
A|Other things.|^2|2295
B|and it's hard to,|%|2295
A|Yeah,|aa|2295
A|yeah,|aa|2295
A|yeah|aa|2295
A|but I think when the time comes, I, I hope to have the time to really look around, you know and pick one that I really think my mother would be happy at.|sd|2295
B|Yes.|aa|2295
B|Uh-huh,|b|2295
B|I think that's important, too,|aa|2295
B|in fact there's a,|%|2295
A|I do too.|aa|2295
A|Outside's awful deceiving sometimes you know.|sv|2295
B|Yes.|aa|2295
B|There's one close to where my mother is,|sd|2295
B|but in order to get in, you have to be able to, um, walk in on your own,|sd|2295
B|in other words, you can't be in, you know, too bad a shape to start out with.|sd|2295
A|Yeah.|b|2295
A|Yeah.|b|2295
B|But then if you deteriorate, um, they have a separate section for those who need care you know, all the time.|sd|2295
A|yeah.|b|2295
A|Yeah.|b|2295
B|But it's always, well,|%|2295
B|and they have a long waiting list, too.|sd|2295
B|So there's always this feeling of, well, golly gee, you know, you've got to be able to walk in the door,|sd|2295
B|so you can't wait until you're too bad off|sd|2295
A|Off,|b^m|2295
A|yeah.|b|2295
B|but then, you don't want to go do that when you don't have to because like, uh, you have to give up your automobile or whatever.|sv|2295
A|To,|b^m|2295
A|no.|aa|2295
A|Uh-huh,|b|2295
A|and everything you worked so hard for all your life|sd|2295
B|Yeah|b|2295
A|yeah.|%|2295
B|and if you're still capable of driving and doing those things, then you feel like, well, gee, I'm, you know, I'm isolating myself here for no reason at the moment.|sv|2295
A|Uh-huh.|b|2295
A|Uh-huh.|b|2295
B|So it's kind of a, that's a hard one,|sv|2295
B|but it is a very nice nursing home.|sd|2295
A|Now there is some really nice ones.|ba|2295
A|There's also, you know, some private ones, you know|sd|2295
B|Uh-huh.|b|2295
A|but of course, I would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that, you know,|sd|2295
B|Yeah,|aa|2295
B|that's the problem|sv|2295
A|that's way out of my reach.|sd|2295
B|the expense of it all is,|%|2295
B|and, uh, what I, another thing I hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money, and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately.|sv|2295
A|Oh, yeah.|b|2295
B|But those who don't have money can go in and get the same care. You know|sv|2295
A|Uh-huh|b|2295
A|the very same,|aa|2295
A|yeah.|aa|2295
B|So I don't like that aspect.|sd|2295
A|No,|aa|2295
A|but I, there's, I think there's ways around it, though, that, you know,|sv|2295
A|like, they could put it in one of their children's names or something you know.|sv|2295
B|Yeah.|b|2295
A|But still, a lot of them doesn't feel comfortable doing that.|sd|2295
A|You know, it's their money.|sv|2295
B|That's right.|aa|2295
A|You know, that's how I feel about it, anyway.|sd|2295
B|Well, yeah,|b|2295
B|I've talked to my mother about that several times lately,|sd|2295
B|and I, I said, I want you to have control of your own business.|sd|2295
A|Yes.|b|2295
B|But, you know, what if.|qh|2295
A|Yeah,|b|2295
A|my mother's seventy now,|sd|2295
A|so naturally she's retired,|sd|2295
A|but she's still on her own, I mean.|sd|2295
B|Yeah,|b|2295
B|yeah,|b|2295
B|my mother's, uh, seventy-five and still has her own home and everything.|sd|2295
A|I think that's wonderful,|ba|2295
A|I really do,|ba|2295
A|just as long as they can,|sv|2295
A|and then on the other hand, I've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy you know.|sd|2295
B|Yeah.|b|2295
B|That's true.|aa|2295
B|They have a lot of people around to do things with.|sv|2295
A|Uh-huh,|b|2295
A|they're not lonely.|sv|2295
B|Some of those places have wonderful activities and things, you know, lots of stuff going on.|sd|2295
A|Oh, yes,|aa|2295
A|uh-huh.|b|2295
B|And they'll take them places|sd|2295
A|Yeah.|b|2295
B|so. I don't know,|h|2295
B|it's not all bad|sv|2295
A|No.|aa|2295
B|but I guess once you get ill, then, you know, you really have some problems if you can't get around and do things.|sv|2295
A|Around,|aa|2295
A|yeah.|aa|2295
A|But I really don't know what the other solution would be you know,|sd|2295
B|No.|b|2295
A|I really don't.|sd|2295
A|But no,|%|2295
A|when the time comes I'm really, hopefully we'll really look around before I decide on one for my parents|sd|2295
B|Uh-huh.|b|2295
A|really do,|%|2295
A|because I have been raised in one, you know,|sd|2295
A|so there's lot of things I know to look for.|sd|2295
B|Yeah.|b|2295
A|And I don't think they'd want to go where they used to work, either you know|sd|2295
B|Yeah.|b|2295
A|I really don't.|sd|2295
B|That might be kind of tough, huh.|sv|2295
A|It really would,|aa|2295
A|yes,|aa|2295
A|yes,|aa|2295
A|and like I said, my sister's still in it,|sd|2295
A|and I really don't think my mother'd want to be there, either.|sd|2295
A|Oh.|b|2295
A|Well, it's been nice talking to you.|fc|2295
B|Well, you too.|fc|2295
A|And I guess we'd better get back to work, huh.|fc|2295
B|Okay.|fc|2295
A|All right.|fc|2295
A|Bye-bye.|fc|2295
B|Bye.|fc|2295
