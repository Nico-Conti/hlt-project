A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|4703
B|So, what is your opinion on, on drug testing?|qw|4703
A|Well I can see it in certain cases where it might be, uh, somebody's in a position that, uh, perhaps a lot of lives are involved, like, maybe, uh, pilots that, uh, you know, fly jets|sv|4703
A|and, uh, maybe people that have a lot of responsibility over a large mass of people.|sv|4703
A|I could certainly see it being done|sv|4703
A|but, in general, uh, you know,|%|4703
A|whether companies want to do this|sd|4703
A|and I know that companies do.|sd|4703
A|Like factory workers that have lots of accidents are now being drug tested.|sd|4703
A|I know a couple of corporations that are doing that.|sd|4703
A|Uh, so, you know, they kind of have gotten into the idea that let's drug test them and let's put them through rehab.|sv|4703
A|But there's got to be like a limitation.|sv|4703
A|Do we drug test everybody that comes in|qh|4703
A|and or do we kind of say, well you can be drug tested|qrr|4703
A|and you look okay because you look this way.|^q|4703
A|You're, you're very conservative|^q|4703
A|and, and there's just no way that we would think that you would use drugs|^q|4703
A|but the guy that doesn't fit the stereotype of, uh, the conservative or whatever could be drug tested.|sv|4703
A|And,|%|4703
A|uh, you know, whether legal rights and, of that person,|%|4703
A|I don't know.|h|4703
A|There's certainly a lot of things to really consider, uh, when you get into drug testing people just at the work place unless, of course, like I said, they have a large responsibility over a mass of people|sv|4703
A|uh, that's about it.|sd|4703
B|Well, yeah,|b|4703
B|it, it, it's just not the|%|4703
B|you're talking about company's liability.|qy^d|4703
A|Uh-huh,|ny|4703
A|uh-huh.|ny|4703
B|If, if, uh, if the company is liable for something that, that, a employee does while under the influence of, of a drug, you know, then by all means they should have the right to, to, to, to  to minimize their liability.|sv|4703
A|Sure,|aa|4703
A|sure.|aa|4703
A|And I think that's what companies are doing, uh, more and more because there are products that are out there.|sv|4703
B|And there's also the case about just, uh, uh, health, health and welfare of the, uh, employees.|sd|4703
A|Uh-huh.|b|4703
B|If a company has a healthy work force, their  insurance rates are low.|sv|4703
A|Exactly.|aa|4703
A|Sure,|b|4703
A|sure.|b|4703
B|And not only not only low, there's all sorts of a, of a benefits, uh, financial benefits associated  with having, you know, having people file fewer claims, being sick.|sd|4703
A|Sure.|b|4703
A|Exactly.|aa|4703
A|The only thing is,|sd|4703
B|There, there's the whole question that, that a, that a work force that is known not to be on drugs is going to be more healthy|sd|4703
B|I don't think anybody  would argue with that.|sv|4703
A|Exactly.|aa|4703
A|Exactly.|aa|4703
A|The only thing is, uh,|sd|4703
A|the one issue that I would take stands with is the fact that the drug testing itself can be done on a person that is actually not on drugs and come out positive.|sv|4703
B|Right.|b|4703
A|If they have had like, uh, medications in the past, let's say, once a month or twice a month or three times a month or maybe that week they take an Advil|sd|4703
A|and the Advil will, apparently, come out positive as if they smoked marijuana.|sv|4703
B|Right.|b|4703
A|Uh, and there's poppy seed type things.|sd|4703
A|I think that everybody is aware of that|sv|4703
A|but, uh, where's the line where you, where you say to somebody, I'm going to drug test you tomorrow|qh|4703
A|so please do not take these medications|^q|4703
A|or where's,|qh|4703
A|you know how can  how you can do it?|qw|4703
B|Well,|%|4703
B|the|%|4703
B|Right.|b|4703
B|The question becomes what do you do about somebody who tests, who tests positive.|qh|4703
A|Exactly.|aa|4703
B|that's where the real sticking point comes in.|sv|4703
A|Uh-huh.|b|4703
B|It's not,|%|4703
B|I don't think there's any problem with testing people.|sv|4703
A|Sure.|b|4703
B|It's what do you do with the information?|qw|4703
A|Sure.|aa|4703
A|Exactly.|aa|4703
A|and the only thing that I would say on that is it could blacklist an employee later on.|sv|4703
A|Let's say, uh, you've taken medication of some sort, even though they usually have you, at the time, list what medications you've taken.|sd|4703
A|Uh, let's say you do come out positive|sd|4703
A|and you've taken Advil or any of the Ibuprofen products out there.|sd|4703
A|Or you've had a cold|sd|4703
A|and you've been on medication or whatever,|sd|4703
A|you come out positive.|sd|4703
A|Is it then the chance that the employer will look at you in more of a negative fashion and say well, you know, this is kind of iffy, you know,|qh|4703
A|are they really on drugs|^q|4703
A|or, or they on drugs,|^q|4703
A|you know what I'm saying.|qy|4703
A|Where  there might be in the back of the mind of the employer that this person, uh, is on drugs|qw|4703
B|Right.|b|4703
A|or make up, they may make up their mind that let's get rid of this employee,|sd|4703
A|you know what I'm  saying?|qy|4703
B|Right.|b|4703
B|Well, yeah.|ny|4703
B|I think clearly, the person who is the line the line manager|sv|4703
A|Uh-huh.|b|4703
B|the employee should not be privy to the information of drug testing.|sv|4703
B|That should go to an entirely different, uh, agency within a corporation.|sv|4703
A|Exactly.|aa|4703
B|Uh,|b|4703
A|And it's a,|%|4703
A|they can that the,|sd|4703
A|if it does come out positive the first time, they need to go back and find out what medications did that person take,|sv|4703
A|you know what I mean?|qy|4703
A|It, it's kind of like, uh,|sd|4703
A|I think most people are aware, at least now, common knowledge is that|sv|4703
