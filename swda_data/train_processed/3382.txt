A|Uh, I guess, uh, I've always been kind of interested in, in, space and stuff.|sd|3382
A|I've, read a lot of the, the, uh, astronomy books and, and stuff like that. Uh,|sd|3382
B|Uh-huh.|b|3382
B|Uh-huh.|b|3382
B|Uh-huh.|b|3382
B|Uh-huh.|b|3382
B|Have you been following the, uh, the progress of the space health code ?|qy|3382
A|Uh, to a degree.|na|3382
A|I haven't kept up as, uh, much as I would like,|sd|3382
B|Uh-huh.|b|3382
A|I've just been so busy, uh,|sd|3382
B|Uh-huh.|b|3382
A|I barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then,|sd|3382
A|so.|%|3382
B|Yeah.|b|3382
B|I think it's pretty exciting that they can, uh,|sv|3382
B|it would be interesting to see if they can find, uh, other planets that are, that will be more habitable to, uh, you know, uh, humans|sv|3382
B|and, uh, yeah,|%|3382
B|I think I would be very interested in space travel in the future if, uh, if it, you know, if it is at all possible.|sd|3382
A|Yeah.|b|3382
A|Well, I wouldn't even mind, uh, being a pilot on one,|sd|3382
A|or right now|%|3382
A|but I'm probably getting a little too old for that.|sv|3382
B|Well, I know if they make the advances that they have been making, that, uh, maybe age will no longer, age or even physical, uh, abilities may not be, uh, a barrier anymore.|sv|3382
A|Right.|aa|3382
A|Yeah.|aa|3382
A|Well, they, they just made leaps and jumps.|sv|3382
A|I think a lot of our, our technology we have is, is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel, uh, uh, equipment and stuff that,|sv|3382
B|Yeah,|aa|3382
B|I agree. Uh,|aa|3382
B|as a matter of fact we're the ones that I have been to Houston to, to, you know, to visit the, uh, space center out there,|sd|3382
B|and, uh, one of the big advances that we use every day now is Velcro|sd|3382
A|Uh-huh.|b|3382
B|and, uh, that vacuum , uh, little space program was one of the big, you know, backers of that.|sd|3382
A|Yeah.|b|3382
B|It's amazing, you know,|sv|3382
B|you,|%|3382
B|it's hard to imagine what life was like without it now.|sv|3382
A|Yeah.|b|3382
A|I don't know if you ever watch Gallagher , you know,|qy^d|3382
A|he's one of the comedians|sd|3382
A|and and, you know, he, he talks a lot on, on Velcro.|sd|3382
B|Uh-huh,|ny|3382
B|yeah,|ny|3382
B|I've seen him before.|sd|3382
A|what would we do without it?|qh|3382
B|Yeah.|b|3382
B|we were talking about that just the other day.|sd|3382
B|What did we do without it back then?|qh|3382
A|Yeah.|b|3382
B|I guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps.|sv|3382
A|Yeah.|b|3382
A|Yeah,|b|3382
A|there's, there's a lot of, a lot of little things that have come up .|sv|3382
A|I know maybe some of the big things that, uh, uh,|%|3382
A|concentrated foods for one maybe|sd|3382
A|I Uh, I don't know|h|3382
B|That's right.|aa|3382
B|That's right.|aa|3382
A|it's also just I've, I've often pictured, uh, in my mind, you know, what it would be like to just, what would you find if you just kept on going, kept on going?|qh|3382
B|Uh-huh.|aa|3382
B|That's true.|aa|3382
A|Uh, I guess our minds are so, uh, uh, what is it? Uh, finite|sv|3382
B|Uh-huh.|b|3382
A|when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object, and it's hard to, to see, you know.|sv|3382
B|Uh-huh.|b|3382
B|Yeah.|b|3382
A|I always thought well, what do you do hit a brick wall, eventually.|sd|3382
A|It's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely.|sv|3382
B|Yeah,|aa|3382
B|that, that is, uh, that is something that would be hard to think about.|aa|3382
B|I agree.|aa|3382
B|You know like you say we're used to finite things|aa|3382
B|and something that is infinite and just incomprehensible.|sv|3382
A|Yeah.|aa|3382
A|But,|%|3382
B|But, uh, yeah,|b|3382
B|I would like to see them, uh, do more in that area to make space travel more, uh, something that the ordinary person can, uh, enjoy.|sd|3382
A|Yeah.|aa|3382
A|I know it's I think it's in people's nature to be the first to do something.|sv|3382
B|Uh-huh.|b|3382
A|And I, I'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like, you know,|sd|3382
B|Yeah.|b|3382
B|Yeah,|b|3382
B|me too.|sd|3382
B|I wouldn't even mind being not so much being first but just, uh, get out there and, and just explore.|sd|3382
A|Yeah.|b|3382
B|I think, uh, it's in everyone's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they haven't, or experience something, you know, indifferent.|sv|3382
A|Huh.|b|3382
A|I think that's what made us, uh, progress to the state we are is our curiosity.|sv|3382
B|Oh, sure.|aa|3382
B|Sure.|aa|3382
B|Of course.|aa|3382
B|That's true.|aa|3382
A|There must be some better better way of doing this.|sv|3382
A|A better place to be or whatever, you know|sv|3382
A|it's,|%|3382
B|Uh-huh.|b|3382
A|So you, you are always looking for something better.|sv|3382
B|Yeah,|aa|3382
B|that's true.|aa|3382
A|I know at work, uh, people always complain to me|sd|3382
A|I, well, you are always whining|sd|3382
A|and, it's, I'm always looking for something better. Uh,|sd|3382
B|Yeah|b|3382
A|There's a better way of doing it than what we are doing it.|sv|3382
B|That's right.|aa|3382
B|That's right.|aa|3382
B|And if you are just content with being, you know, with the way things are then, you know, then you must lead, lead a pretty dull life.|sv|3382
A|Yeah.|b|3382
B|Because if|%|3382
A|Well, they are always finding easier ways|sv|3382
A|and, you know, just because they don't talk about it or something like that.|sv|3382
B|Uh-huh.|b|3382
A|And they are doing it you know, unconsciously.|sv|3382
B|Yeah,|aa|3382
B|I guess, uh, you don't really think about it too much.|sv|3382
B|I guess you are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff|sv|3382
B|but|%|3382
B|it, it's in a subconscious, you know, thing.|sv|3382
B|You know, somewhere they can sit down and write down what, you know, things that you've improved upon,|sv|3382
B|you probably wouldn't have a pretty good list.|sv|3382
A|Uh-huh.|b|3382
B|But you just don't think about them.|sv|3382
A|Right.|b|3382
B|And that's true.|aa|3382
B|I think, uh, you know,|%|3382
B|we've gotten different programs at work, you know, to, to, uh, make it visible to management that we are doing things better,|sd|3382
