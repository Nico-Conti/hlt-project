A|I have two children,|sd|3237
A|and our home is really too small for us right now|sd|3237
B|Ours is, too.|sd|3237
B|We outgrew it when we moved in.|sd|3237
A|Yeah,|b|3237
A|we moved from an apartment that was really small,|sd|3237
B|Uh-huh.|b|3237
A|and at the time we just had a little baby that was five months old|sd|3237
B|Uh-huh.|b|3237
A|so we moved into this house in Garland,|sd|3237
A|it's in one of the older areas of town|sd|3237
B|Uh-huh.|b|3237
A|and one thing I really like is it has big trees everywhere|sd|3237
B|Uh-huh.|b|3237
A|you know, lots of shade and squirrels and birds and real pretty,|sd|3237
B|Um.|b|3237
A|but the, the house is real small|sd|3237
B|Yeah.|b|3237
A|it has less than a thousand square feet|sd|3237
B|Oh, wow.|ba|3237
A|yeah,|b|3237
A|it's real little.|sd|3237
B|You all are cramped|bf|3237

B|Uh-huh.|b|3237
B|Oh.|b|3237
B|Uh-huh,|b|3237
B|how many bedrooms is it?|qw|3237
A|Well, they advertised it as a three bedroom house because it has a built on addition room, you know|arp_nd|3237
B|Uh-huh|b|3237
B|Uh-huh.|b|3237
A|but the room that's built on doesn't have a closet|sd|3237
B|Oh.|bk|3237
A|so, um, the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom|sd|3237
B|Uh-huh.|b|3237
A|but we have always just put like our computer and extra toys and books and|sd|3237
B|Uh-huh.|b|3237
A|you know, it's kind of a catch all room|sd|3237
A|But it sure is nice to have it when the kids come over to play|sd|3237
B|Yeah.|b|3237
A|they all go out there to play with the Barbies and that kind of stuff,|sd|3237
B|Uh-huh.|b|3237
A|so.|%|3237
B|How fun.|ba|3237
A|Yeah,|aa|3237
A|that works out good.|sd|3237
A|And I'm thankful I have two girls, because they're in bunk beds,|sd|3237
A|and so, you know, they can share a room and, uh, make for more space that way.|sd|3237
B|Uh-huh.|b|3237
B|Uh-huh.|b|3237
B|And how old's the youngest?|qw|3237
A|She's three and a half|sd|3237

A|so, um, and right now we have their clothes on, uh, like double racks, you know, in the closet|sd|3237
B|Uh-huh.|b|3237
A|we made a higher and a lower|sd|3237
B|Uh-huh.|b|3237
A|and it works out fine,|sd|3237
A|but they're just about to get too tall where the dresses are beginning to drag you know,|sd|3237
B|Uh-huh.|b|3237
A|and, um, we're going to have to figure out a new idea.|sd|3237
A|But we're, we're kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home uh, hoping to be able to do that within a year or so|sd|3237
B|Yeah.|b|3237

A|and it was redone before we moved in, which,|sd|3237
A|I'm thankful for that,|sd|3237

B|Oh, yeah,|aa|3237
B|yeah,|aa|3237

B|Well, you know, now we have that new mall in Lewisville|sd|3237
A|Oh, really,|bk|3237
B|and that's just like a mile or two from our house|sd|3237
A|Oh, well, that's nice.|ba|3237
B|but, when we first moved to Coppell, it's what, six years ago, we didn't even have a grocery store|sd|3237
A|Oh, wow,|ba|3237
B|and now we have four|sd|3237
A|Oh.|bk|3237

A|Yeah,|aa|3237
A|yeah|aa|3237
B|so,|%|3237
A|but it does sound like it's definitely growing.|bf|3237
B|Oh, much very much.|aa|3237
A|Yeah.|b|3237
B|In fact, it's about the size now,|sd|3237
B|I moved down here from Chicago, what, twenty-three years ago and, to Lewisville|sd|3237
A|Oh, uh-huh.|b|3237
A|Uh-huh.|b|3237
B|and Coppell's now about the size that Lewisville was when, when I moved down here.|sd|3237
A|Oh, I see.|b|3237
A|Well, when we first moved here, we moved here from Lubbock|sd|3237
B|Uh-huh.|b|3237
A|and we almost moved to Lewisville,|sd|3237
A|that was our second choice, yeah, behind Garland,|sd|3237
