A|Good morning.|fp|2446
B|Good morning.|fp|2446
B|Uh, okay,|%|2446
B|go ahead.|ad|2446
A|, no,|ar|2446
A|no,|ar|2446
A|go ahead.|ad|2446
B|Yeah,|aa|2446
B|I understand the topic this morning is, uh, our policy in Latin America and, you know, what we've been doing down there.|sd|2446
B|So, uh, as you indicated you don't have too much input into the area|bf|2446
B|it, it just so happens that, uh, our daughter-in-law is Panamanian,|sd|2446
B|and, uh, we have been in Panama|sd|2446
B|and I have worked in El Salvador|sd|2446
B|and, uh, we visit Mexico occasionally,|sd|2446
B|so, yeah,|%|2446
B|we, we do have a little information on it here,|sd|2446
B|but, uh,|%|2446
A|Oh, very good,|ba|2446
A|because actually, um, when I was in college I visited Mexico several times,|sd|2446
A|I was in the Peace Corps and, um, Peru,|sd|2446
B|Oh, uh-huh|b|2446
A|but, but recently I have been following the Middle East rather than, Central America|sd|2446
B|Yeah.|b|2446
B|Yeah,|b|2446
B|it does seem to have quieted down there just a little bit|sv|2446
B|that's, that's for sure.|ba|2446
B|No,|nn|2446
B|I,|%|2446
B|the U S policy, uh, towards Central America as far as, uh,|%|2446
B|well, I kind of go back to, to the El Salvador thing because Texas Instruments had a, a plant down there for a while,|sd|2446
B|and I worked in there for a little while,|sd|2446
B|and at that particular time,|sd|2446
B|let's, let's see,|^h|2446
B|that was seventy-three, seventy-four kind of before the, the, uh, the Civil War really picked up down there,|sd|2446
B|and U S policy at that particular time there was, of course, military assistance to, uh, to the government itself, you know,|sd|2446
B|anything that's, that's anti-Communist, you know, we kind of had a tendency to be pro|sd|2446
A|Right.|b|2446
B|It don't matter what their excesses were,|sd|2446
B|and I believe at the time that I was down there, that, uh, the government, uh, the Salvadorian government you know, really gotten out of hand yet,|sd|2446
B|the, uh, right wing death squad type situation|sd|2446
B|I believe that, that was beginning to form|sd|2446
B|but I don't, I, I wasn't really aware of it's being, you know, terribly, uh, you know, at the time that, that I was down there,|sd|2446
B|I think that really kind of developed a little bit later on,|sd|2446
B|but, uh, our policies seem to be pretty much one of, uh, you know, trying to setup businesses down there and use the one resource, anyway, that Salvador had,|sd|2446
B|plenty of and that was people.|sd|2446
A|Right.|b|2446
B|We didn't seem to be going in and taking anything out of the country other than just it's, it's labor,|sd|2446
A|Uh-huh.|b|2446
B|because everything that T I did anyway we, we shipped in|sd|2446
B|and it was worked on down there, assembled, and then sent back here,|sd|2446
B|so,|%|2446
A|Uh-huh,|b|2446
A|did that have,|qy|2446
B|I didn't feel that we really exploiting them any.|sd|2446
A|Um, so, you don't, you don't feel that, that we were, um, exploiting in the sense of we were benefiting|bf|2446
A|and they weren't.|bf|2446
B|No, uh,|aa|2446
B|in the particular incidence that I was aware of, now T I wasn't the only ones in there,|sd|2446
B|Playtex was in,|sd|2446
B|there was, uh, several other companies,|sd|2446
A|Uh-huh.|b|2446
B|and, uh, of course, we kind of concentrate on ,|sv|2446
B|there wasn't much to take out of the country|sd|2446
B|I felt like we're going in and taken all their, um, their gold or oil, or bananas or coffee or anything like that,|sd|2446
A|Uh-huh.|b|2446
B|because, uh, it just,|%|2446
B|the only thing that they had a great abundance of was, uh, you know, human beings|sd|2446
B|and, uh,|%|2446
A|Uh-huh.|b|2446
A|did we tend to, um, change their attitudes|qy|2446
A|like sometimes when Americans go into foreign countries they tend to flaunt American things, Americanism, um, consumer products, T V, the whole works.|sv|2446
B|Yeah,|aa|2446
B|I understand what you say.|ba|2446
B|There was a, uh,|%|2446
B|the time that I was down there, I stayed quite a, a bit at the, uh, uh, one of the big hotels San Salvador.|sd|2446
B|And at the time I thought there ought to be a law against American tourists. Because they, for the most part, tend to be the most obnoxious as a, as a group,|sd|2446
B|and I saw this in Panama also,|sd|2446
A|Uh-huh.|b|2446
B|uh, oh, you know, it's, it's the, uh, the almost stereotype, you know,|sv|2446
B|flowery shirt, shorts, camera hanging around their neck, you know, demanding this, that and the other thing, you know,|sv|2446
B|we're, we're here,|^q|2446
B|and we want this,|^q|2446
B|and we want that,|^q|2446
B|and that sort of thing,|sd|2446
B|that's, that's the stereotype that's very strong down there, you know,|sd|2446
B|the, the, the, you know, that sort of thing,|sd|2446
B|I, I, I believe those of us who were working down there, got a little bit more appreciation for, you know, the local, uh, culture|sd|2446
B|I really don't believe that we were quite that bad,|sd|2446
B|but yet they were having to deal directly with, uh, you know, with the, uh, the local people.|sd|2446
A|Uh-huh,|b|2446
A|uh-huh.|b|2446
B|And, uh, but boy|ba|2446
B|there is a, there is a bad, uh, uh, you know, the old brash or ugly American-type, situation.|sd|2446
A|Uh-huh.|b|2446
B|And I saw incidences in the hotel where I just wanted to go over and crawl in the corner and say, oh, my God|sd|2446
B|those are, those are not Americans|^q|2446
B|they can't be.|^q|2446
A|Right.|b|2446
B|But there are|^q|2446
B|and, uh, of course, now I, I do have to, I remember one case where we had some Canadians in there who were every bit as bad,|sd|2446
B|but I mean, it, I think it's just kind of the North American situation .|sd|2446
B|In Panama they've been used to Americans down there for so darn long|sd|2446
B|but I didn't see quite as much of that sort of thing, as Panamanians are just about as as, uh, as as Americans, as far as, uh, creature comforts, you know,|sd|2446
B|they're, uh, they're, they're every bit, uh,|%|2446
B|I, I know, when, my, my son was in the Air Force|sd|2446
B|and he was stationed in Panama,|sd|2446
B|and he married a Panamanian girl,|sd|2446
B|and when she came up here, uh, you know,|sd|2446
B|she's, except for the language situation, some of the cultures she's just about an American, you know, is as far as T V and, and, you know, the, the moneymaking part of it and all that,|sd|2446
A|Uh-huh.|b|2446
B|matter of fact if anything, she's worse.|sd|2446
A|Uh-huh,|b|2446
A|uh-huh|b|2446
B|But, uh, uh, it, it just, there's little enclaves down there where, you know, Americans have a lot of influence|sd|2446
B|and the local population kind of, um, you know, sort of accepts that,|sd|2446
B|but I've also seen the other side of it, too.|sd|2446
A|Uh-huh|b|2446
B|Well, you were in Peru?|qy|2446
A|Yeah,|ny|2446
A|I was in Peru,|sd|2446
A|but, um, I, there weren't, as I recall, or at least I wasn't aware of that many Americans there except for a very heavy concentration of Peace Corps volunteers,|sd|2446
B|Uh-huh|b|2446
A|this was when the Peace Corps first are started,|sd|2446
B|Uh-huh.|b|2446
A|and it was one of the big targets|sd|2446
A|and, um, I don't, I don't think, at that time, at least, Peace Corps was, uh, an obnoxious group in the sense that, that we were very controlled regarding number of days off|sd|2446
A|and, and you couldn't just, take up, take off and leave your group and go explore and, and things like that,|sd|2446
B|Oh.|b|2446
B|Uh-huh.|b|2446
A|but, and I was working actually in the savings and loan program,|sd|2446
A|so, that was quite specialized,|sd|2446
A|although I was living in the slums, I was really working with the middle class.|sd|2446
B|Uh-huh|b|2446
B|What, uh, what area did you live in?|qw|2446
A|I was up in Arequipa .|sd|2446
B|Oh, okay|bk|2446
B|yeah.|%|2446
A|And, um|%|2446
B|I've heard of it.|sd|2446
A|Uh-huh|b|2446
A|so.|%|2446
B|Well, is, are they, is Peace Corps still active down in there?|qy|2446
A|I don't have any idea, um,|no|2446
A|probably not,|ng|2446
A|I mean, there were I was, uh, Peru thirteen, which meant there were twelve groups before mine, that had gone in|sd|2446
B|Uh-huh.|b|2446
A|and, and some of them were quite big in the sense they were community development,|sd|2446
A|and they were building schools and doing co-ops and things like that,|sd|2446
A|health, um, inoculation and, and things.|sd|2446
B|Oh, has those influences lasted|qy|2446
B|do you know whether the, the things that, that you and your groups before you did, did those, did those live on|qy|2446
B|or were they reabsorbed|qrr|2446
B|or how,|%|2446
A|No,|nn|2446
A|no,|nn|2446
A|I believe they did|sd|2446
A|because, um, some of, some of the, the Peace Corps, uh, that I knew of, did marry Peruvians, and have been back|sd|2446
B|Uh-huh|b|2446
A|and every now and then some news filters in that they went to see some of the old things,|sd|2446
A|and of course, the savings and loan program, um, that was, that, you know, that, that just continued to grow.|sd|2446
A|In fact, after my group,|sd|2446
A|I mean, we were just a very small specialized group, too, to get that going and spread|sd|2446
A|and then, of course, Peace Corps bowed out of that because that's, uh, uh, something that nationalized very quickly.|sd|2446
B|Uh-huh.|b|2446
A|And the same with the co-ops.|sd|2446
B|Well, that's, that was kind of the, the aim wasn't it, to get it started and then have it, taken up by the,|bf|2446
A|Right.|aa|2446
B|oh, okay,|%|2446
B|so, you know, well, that's,|%|2446
B|I had wondered sometimes,|sd|2446
B|I knew that there was a lot of, a lot of effort|sd|2446
B|and a lot of work went into a lot of that,|sv|2446
B|and I just wondered if, if it lasted, and if it took, you know,|sd|2446
B|like, uh,|%|2446
A|Uh-huh|b|2446
A|Yeah,|b|2446
A|I've, you know, some of the programs I would have concern about like, um, the language teaching, you know,|sd|2446
A|I mean, why should we push English,|qh|2446
B|Uh-huh|b|2446
A|and a lot of people were down there teaching English|sd|2446
A|and when they talked about Hungary or someplace, one of the eastern law countries requesting Peace Corps to teach language, you know, to me that's a little bit marginal.|sd|2446
A|I did teach economics at the university one night a week,|sd|2446
A|and the textbook was in English,|sd|2446
A|but basically I taught it in Spanish, because, I mean, I really didn't see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test.|sd|2446
B|Oh.|b|2446
B|Yeah,|aa|2446
B|my brother-in-law teaches at, uh, Northern Illinois University|sd|2446
B|and they were in China, here a couple of years ago,|sd|2446
B|and he was over there at, uh, the University of Shah and, and teaching ...|sd|2446
