B|Yes.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3449
A|I haven't, uh, talked to anybody outside the Metroplex,|sd|3449
A|so I didn't even think of saying Arlington, Texas.|sd|3449
A|This is a real first|sd|3449
B|Yes.|b|3449
A|Are you at work?|qy|3449
B|Yes,|ny|3449
B|I am.|sd|3449
A|I, I, I've been trying to get people at five thirty and six thirty in the evening|sd|3449
A|and I thought, well, I'm not having any luck,|sd|3449
A|I'll try the middle of the afternoon.|^q|3449
B|Well, I'm, I'm happy we got through.|sd|3449
A|I am, too.|aa|3449
A|Well, do you have any, uh, opinion on the subject?|qy|3449
B|Well, I'm, I'm especially interested with what, what's happening in the Soviet Union, uh,|sd|3449
B|the, the move to, uh the, the, the, Ukraine's vote to, uh, basically to secede and set itself up independently uh, is quite a remarkable, counts,|sv|3449
A|Democracy.|^2|3449
A|Oh.|b|3449
B|is that, is that reported in the Texas papers?|qy|3449
A|Oh, sure,|na|3449
A|we, uh, we hear a little of the news Uh,|sd|3449
A|yeah,|%|3449
A|I have heard about that the last couple of days.|sd|3449
A|How, how big is the Ukraine, the area,|qw|3449
A|do you know?|qy|3449
B|Uh, as an area, it's not,|%|3449
A|Or a population or anything,|%|3449
A|I'm really uninformed.|sd|3449
B|I, I'm afraid I don't have the statistics in front of me.|sd|3449
A|Uh-huh.|b|3449
B|It's a, it's not a tiny area. Uh,|sv|3449
B|if I was looking at a U S map, I would say it was sort of reminds me of, of a, uh,|sd|3449
B|it's not as big as California proportionately.|sd|3449
A|Uh-huh,|b|3449
A|uh-huh.|b|3449
B|But, but, but it's, it's more significant, in the sense of, it's a great agricultural region.|sv|3449
A|Oh, I see,|b|3449
A|oh, I, I didn't really know that,|sd|3449
A|I know a lot of their, oh, their countries that they had overtaken, or wanted to be independent or several of them, right,|qy|3449
B|Yeah.|ny|3449
A|And, uh, what about Astonia,|qw|3449
A|are they,|qy|3449
B|They're completely out now.|sd|3449
A|Right,|aa|3449
A|I thought they were.|sd|3449
B|Yes,|aa|3449
B|the three, the three Baltic, uh, republics got out as quickly as they could.|sd|3449
A|But, but, the, the Ukraine is especially significant because it, of the agriculture?|qy^d|3449
B|Right,|na|3449
B|it's, it's very important for the economics of the whole, of the Soviet Union.|sv|3449
A|Uh, so there were probably really fight to keep it in if they could.|qy^d|3449
B|Right, uh,|na|3449
B|except they can't fight|sv|3449
A|No,|aa|3449
A|they don't,|sd|3449
B|It's done democratically, uh,|sd|3449
A|And Bush has already given his opinion on it, right?|qy|3449
B|Yes.|ny|3449
A|Didn't I read that?|qy|3449
B|Yes.|ny|3449
A|So, now, uh, not that they may, that may matter,|sv|3449
A|I don't know, anymore.|h|3449
A|I, uh, fear for the Russians from what I read, you know,|sd|3449
A|I wonder how they're going to get through the winter. Food wise or any wise,|sd|3449
B|Uh,|%|3449
A|sounds to me like they'll start rioting soon, or not that that would do any good,|sv|3449
A|but I guess people do that when they're desperate.|sv|3449
B|That, that's true, uh, hasn't happened here for a while,|sv|3449
B|but it, uh,|%|3449
A|Well, that's true,|aa|3449
A|since the Depression,|sd|3449
A|I guess when the veterans went to Washington|sv|3449
B|Uh-huh.|b|3449
A|and well, you know, the war riots, of course.|sv|3449
A|Let's just hope we don't get to that point|ad|3449
A|Things are not so good in Texas job wise.|sd|3449
B|No,|aa|3449
B|I've, I've heard they're, I hear you have some problems.|sd|3449
A|Well, we do.|sd|3449
A|We have lots and lots of, uh, layoffs here. Lot of companies folding, lot of layoffs|sd|3449
A|and it's pretty scary.|sv|3449
B|Do, do you, do you blame the, the government in Washington for this?|qy|3449
A|Well, I don't understand economics that well.|sd|3449
A|I don't know,|no|3449
A|I, I know that we have a terrible situation with foreign trade and that other countries put a lot of restrictions that we don't|sd|3449
B|Yeah.|b|3449
A|and so I assume that that has some effect. Or a great effect.|sv|3449
B|Yeah.|b|3449
B|Uh-huh.|b|3449
A|And I do, uh, I mean, they said during the way, Reagan-Bush years, the rich got richer,|sd|3449
A|the poor got poorer,|sd|3449
A|the statistics prove that|sd|3449
A|so, uh, I, I guess,|%|3449
B|So then, you think it's, it's, you think it's Reagan and Bush have done this|qy|3449
B|or is it just coincidence it was during this period?|qrr|3449
A|Well, I really don't know.|no|3449
A|I think maybe they, uh, maybe they contributed to it.|sd|3449
A|Maybe they should pay more attention to these trade, or, you know, to the more equalization of the trade.|sv|3449
B|Uh-huh.|b|3449
A|Of course, if somebody in, in China can make something for ten cents and we have to make it for ten dollars because we have unions, well, I don't know what's going to happen then.|sd|3449
B|Oh, the Chinese use slave labor, too.|aa|3449
A|Right.|b|3449
B|That's, that's one of the ways they get away with it.|sv|3449
A|And child labor.|^2|3449
B|Yeah.|aa|3449
A|Right.|b|3449
A|Well, I don't know.|sd|3449
A|What do you think has caused our horrible situation?|qw|3449
B|Uh, I don't think there's any one simple answer to the whole thing.|sv|3449
A|One thing.|^2|3449
B|I mean it's, that's very complicated.|sv|3449
A|Right,|b|3449
A|well, they say, too, that having a democratic congress and republican President is not good.|sd|3449
A|I mean, I've read that is a theory.|sd|3449
B|So which one are we going to throw out?|qw|3449
A|Well, I hate to say it,|sd|3449
A|but, I, I'm tending to go straight back into my original democratic party.|sd|3449
B|Uh-huh.|b|3449
A|Uh,|%|3449
B|Texas, Texas used to be a democratic state, didn't it?|qy|3449
A|Oh, I know,|sd|3449
A|it used to,|sv|3449
A|right.|aa|3449
A|Well, you don't want too many democrats anymore|sv|3449
A|and for a while I kind of deserted the party,|sd|3449
A|but now it's looking better to me.|sd|3449
B|I like your governor.|sd|3449
A|Oh, do you?|bh|3449
A|Oh, I'm glad to hear that.|sd|3449
B|She's an impressive woman.|sv|3449
A|Well, I think so, too.|aa|3449
A|I, I just, admire her a lot.|sd|3449
B|Yeah.|b|3449
A|And, uh, I I really hope she does well.|sd|3449
A|But she's, uh, you know, probably more popular out of the state than she is here, although she did manage to win.|sv|3449
B|Right|b|3449
A|But look who she was running against, you know|ad|3449
B|Well, yeah,|b|3449
B|anybody could beat Claytie in Texas.|sv|3449
A|He shot himself in the foot so many times|sv|3449
A|How did you get on this T I thing?|qw|3449
B|Oh, I, I know some of the people.|sd|3449
