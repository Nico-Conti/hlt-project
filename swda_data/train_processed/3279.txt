A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3279
A|I've got a, you know,|sd|3279
A|I have a real good method of starting to get the budget balancing|sd|3279
A|and then that's get half of the government, rid of the half of the government payroll.|sd|3279
B|I think that would probably, uh, be very possible,|sd|3279
B|and, and we really wouldn't feel it in our services|sd|3279
A|Not all,|ba|3279
A|I, you know, I don't know if you've ever been to Washington D C.|qy^d|3279
B|Yes,|ny|3279
B|I have.|sd|3279
A|Uh, you, you've seen that which was on there and the offices|sd|3279
A|and in light of these, uh, hearings we've all been sitting through the last two weeks, we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed.|sv|3279
B|Right.|b|3279
A|They really don't have enough to keep them busy to keep their noses at, in their own business of what they're doing.|sv|3279
B|Right.|b|3279
A|And the other thing is, uh, besides that I think, uh, two things that very definitely need looking at, one is foreign aid.|sv|3279
A|I have a real problem with all the foreign aid that is going to the countries that really have no use for us.|sv|3279
B|Right.|b|3279
A|I find that a total waste and part of the defense budget.|sv|3279
A|Uh, again being just a voter and a taxpayer, you know, working through our congressman, I don't think there's too much that I'm going to be able to do about it,|sv|3279
A|but I believe in taking an active part in politics,|sv|3279
A|so.|%|3279
B|Yeah.|b|3279
B|Well, I,|%|3279
B|one, one thing that really bothers me beyond, beyond cutting what they spend is that just really aggravates me when the big businesses do not end up paying taxes|sv|3279
B|and the, um, regular normal taxpayers are, you know paying such a large proportion of, of our personal income|sv|3279
A|Uh-huh.|b|3279
B|and then the, uh, corporate, you know, industries just don't seem to not pay proportionally.|sv|3279
A|Right.|b|3279
B|I think that that would, would help a lot.|sv|3279
B|I guess in a way it would trickle down to us in the prices of things,|sv|3279
B|but I don't know. It's just hard to, hard to take and, you know, see so much of our paycheck go out and then realize that they have all the loopholes that they can use.|sv|3279
A|Uh-huh.|b|3279
B|And, uh, seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from, from that direction.|sv|3279
B|But,|%|3279
A|Yeah,|b|3279
A|they don't, they don't seem to, well,|sv|3279
A|I really think the biggest problem|sv|3279
A|and then the Taft-Rudman Act is supposed to help that.|sd|3279
A|The biggest part is they have no accountability for what they're doing.|sv|3279
B|Yeah.|b|3279
A|I mean this nonsense that's coming through now about, uh, uh, lowering payments on Social Security and a few other things that Bush has in mind in order to boost the economy because people have more money as it's, gets, it's ridiculous.|sv|3279
B|Yeah.|b|3279
A|If they don't have that money now, bringing in less is not going to help the problem as far as the government.|sv|3279
B|Not, not going to help.|b^m|3279
B|It's never helped my, my personal situation|sd|3279
B|I I can't say it would help with theirs either|sv|3279
A|No.|aa|3279
A|Yeah,|b|3279
A|and thank God we don't operate our budget, the way they operate theirs or we'd all be in, in dire trouble.|sd|3279
B|Amen .|ba|3279
A|But that's, uh,|%|3279
A|yeah,|%|3279
A|I don't know what we're going to be able to do about it|sd|3279
A|but I guess it's sitting around so long that it's sort of like our mortgages.|sd|3279
A|I don't ever expect to pay mine off before I die|sd|3279
A|so I guess why should the government|sv|3279
A|Isn't,|%|3279
A|that's the way they're thinking these days anyway.|sv|3279
B|It seems, seems to be.|aa|3279
B|I, you know, I,|%|3279
B|it really does bother me when I think about, you know, leaving our children with, with this sort of, uh, a national problem that we can't seem to find an, an answer to it, uh,|sd|3279
B|I don't know.|h|3279
A|I, I don't think it ever will really.|sv|3279
A|I,|%|3279
A|maybe if they ever get to the point the biggest, you know, the biggest outlaid expense has always been either wars or defense.|sd|3279
B|Right.|b|3279
A|Really.|b|3279
A|If they were to take half of what they spend on that and put it on some economic, you know, intergovernmental or inter United States like programs that one really might.|sv|3279
B|Yeah.|b|3279
A|I, I believe in paying my share,|sd|3279
A|and I don't mind, uh, paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to.|sd|3279
A|But I just, I just sometimes feel like I'm being used.|sd|3279
A|But, uh, again I don't think we'll be able to do anything about it,|sv|3279
A|so.|%|3279
B|Well, that's, that's quite possible.|sv|3279
B|I guess we have to, have to keep plugging away a little bit|sv|3279
B|or it will just totally get even more out of control|sv|3279
B|but I, I don't know.|h|3279
A|Yeah.|b|3279
A|Bite the bullet.|sv|3279
A|It sounds like you have a baby there.|bf|3279
B|Yeah.|ny|3279
B|I, I do.|sd|3279
A|Uh-huh.|b|3279
B|She's a,|sd|3279
B|we're not feeling too well over here|sd|3279
B|so that,|%|3279
A|Oh, really?|bh|3279
B|Yeah.|ny|3279
A|Oh, that's a shame.|bd|3279
A|She's not the one going to Washington, huh?|qy|3279
B|No,|nn|3279
B|no.|nn|3279
B|She's,|%|3279
A|Oh|b|3279
B|I don't think I could part with her.|sd|3279
A|Okay.|b|3279
A|Okay, Geri.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3279
A|We've probably been on long enough.|sv|3279
B|Okay.|b|3279
A|They didn't cut us off,|sd|3279
A|but I think that will probably do it|sv|3279
A|so it was nice talking to you.|fc|3279
B|Okay,|fc|3279
B|well, thanks.|fc|3279
A|Okey-doke.|fc|3279
B|Bye-bye|fc|3279
A|Bye-bye.|fc|3279
