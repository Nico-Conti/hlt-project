A|Right.|b|2792
B|You know, that kind of a thing.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|2792
B|Uh, as far as like real novels, I haven't gotten into Shakespeare or any of that type of thing.|sd|2792

B|yeah.|b|2792

B|You know yeah,|ny|2792
B|honestly.|ba|2792
B|Um, I don't do as much reading, like I say, as I would like to.|sd|2792

B|working a lot of hours at work|sd|2792
B|and,|%|2792
A|Really?|bh|2792
B|Yeah,|ny|2792
B|and then, of course,  we have a home|sd|2792
A|I know.|aa|2792
B|so it's, you know,|%|2792
B|a lot time is spent doing things as far as the yard work or housework or,  you know, that type of thing.|sd|2792
A|Yeah.|b|2792
A|I, I set a goal for myself to read a book a month this year which is like about eleven more books than I would have read last year,|sd|2792
A|but so far I've only read like two books|sd|2792
A|and so I'm not doing very well|sd|2792
A|but,|%|2792
B|But see I do crafts too,|sd|2792
A|Yeah.|b|2792
B|so it's hard,|sd|2792
B|I, if I have a minute that's what I, I do.|sd|2792
A|Yeah,|aa|2792
A|I find it's real hard,|sd|2792
A|I let papers, newspapers stack up and magazines stack up, if I don't really set aside a time to look or read them.|sd|2792
B|That's the,|%|2792
B|and, and that's like myself|aa|2792
B|I've, I've, I miss it, because I really find it a very relaxing hobby too.|sd|2792
A|Yeah.|b|2792
B|I really do|sd|2792
B|and, um, I don't know|h|2792
B|it seems like you can get lost in a book, you know,|sv|2792
B|it, it,  it's like an escape for me.|sd|2792
A|Uh-huh.|b|2792
B|I don't know about you.|h|2792
A|Yeah.|b|2792
B|It's,|%|2792
B|if I'm really interested in what I'm reading, I mean, hours can go by|sd|2792
B|and I, I look up at the clock and say, oh, my word, you know.|sd|2792
A|Uh-huh.|b|2792
B|In fact, I'd rather read sometimes than watch T V.|sd|2792
A|Yeah,|aa|2792
A|oh, I would too. Kind of train your mind. *sv^2|aa|2792
B|But I think you get out of the habit, like you say,|sv|2792

B|Yep.|aa|2792
A|Have you ever read, uh, or heard of the book THIS PRESENT DARKNESS?|qy|2792
B|No.|nn|2792

A|and it's really fast paced and intense.|sd|2792
A|It was a nonfiction book or is a fiction book|sd|2792
A|but it was|%|2792
A|it was one of the best I read,|sd|2792
A|I mean, it was real good,|sd|2792
A|and it was, um, it was one of the few books that|sd|2792
A|like it, you know,|%|2792
A|just hurry up and go through without putting down, you know.|sd|2792
B|Yeah,|b|2792
B|right.|b|2792
B|See that's the other problem I have.|sd|2792
B|If I start into something and I really enjoy what I'm reading,  then I have a terrible time getting away from it too.|sd|2792
A|Uh-huh.|b|2792
B|I'll stay up until two or three o'clock in the morning, you know, because I'm so engrossed in it|sd|2792
B|and then before you know it, it's time to get up and go to work.|sd|2792
B|You know, that type of thing.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|2792
A|Yeah.|b|2792
B|That's why|%|2792
B|I, I don't know|h|2792
B|I'm, I'm kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that.|sd|2792
B|Even if I'm, uh, doing something like an afghan, if I'm close to the end, sometimes I'll do the same thing.|sd|2792
A|Uh-huh.|b|2792
B|I don't know what you would call it,|h|2792
B|maybe I have a problem|sv|2792
A|No,|ar|2792
A|I'm sure it's fast or something.|sv|2792
B|It's terrible,|sv|2792
B|I, I really like books that, that you can get into|sd|2792
B|and that's that.|sd|2792
A|Uh-huh.|b|2792
A|I know what you mean.|aa|2792
A|I like reading late at night right before I go to bed sometimes|sd|2792
A|I just sleep better or something.|sd|2792
B|Oh, yeah,|aa|2792
B|you do|aa|2792
B|you kind of get relaxed,|sv|2792
B|that's true.|aa|2792
A|But, uh,|b|2792
B|I have a lot of craft books that I have too and, uh, magazines.|sd|2792
B|I like PEOPLE, you know, those things that are about real people.|sd|2792
A|Uh-huh.|b|2792
B|And, um, I, I like to, uh, read about people who have been a successful,  you know, who, who made a success of their lives. To, to give you specific titles I, I can't. *sd|sd|2792
A|Yeah.|b|2792
A|Which, what book have you read that is along those lines,  that was really good?|qw|2792

B|and um, it was more like, oh,|%|2792
B|it was tapes and things that they had about him, too.|sd|2792
A|Uh-huh.|b|2792
B|How he started out as just a salesman and now he's, you know, multimillionaire and that type of thing,|sd|2792
B|and how you have to, uh, be aggressive and, you know, really want something for yourself and that type of stuff.|sd|2792
B|It's like up to you, in other words, whatever happens in your life.|sd|2792
A|Yeah.|b|2792

A|Yeah.|b|2792
A|And then do it.|bf|2792
B|Do it.|aa|2792
B|I can't,|sd|2792
B|I'm not that focused on something.|sd|2792
B|I, I'm off in all directions.|sd|2792
B|Um, and I'm not, uh, uh, a planner which I wish I was.|sd|2792
A|Uh-huh.|b|2792
B|You know, kind of off the wall.|sd|2792
B|If someone says, do you want to do this tonight, uh, and I got a mountain of things to do, it's okay, you know, we do it.|sd|2792
A|Uh-huh,|b|2792
A|huh. Well, that's all right.|ba|2792
B|I know,|aa|2792

B|I, I, I would, I don't want to change that part of me.|sd|2792
A|That's good.|ba|2792
B|That's funny,|sv|2792
B|even though I admire someone who isn't,  like I am, you know, and, and I wish I could be more that way|sd|2792
A|Yeah.|b|2792
B|but,|%|2792
A|There may be some schools you could read about and learn.|sd|2792
B|That's true,|aa|2792

B|How many people do you supervise?|qw|2792
A|Uh, about twenty.|sd|2792

A|Sometimes more than others.|sd|2792
A|But, yeah,|%|2792
A|I do.|sd|2792
B|Oh, that's,  oh, that's important.|ba|2792
A|I've been there about three years.|sd|2792
B|Do you have a family?|qy|2792
A|Yeah,|ny|2792
A|I just got married last year|sd|2792

B|Except for tornados|sd|2792
A|Boy they, they have storms here|sd|2792
A|I've,|%|2792
B|Yes|aa|2792
B|they do.|aa|2792
B|And it, it,  it's so surprising how it just happens, you know.|sd|2792
A|Hail and thunder and,|ba|2792
A|Yeah.|b|2792
B|Unpredictable.|ba|2792
A|Were you here during the hailstorm two years ago?|qy|2792

B|Oh, I've been up here about three.|sd|2792
B|Uh, we were down there, uh, from eighty-six to, eighty-five to eighty-six,|sd|2792
B|no, uh,|nn|2792
B|well, part of eighty-four to eighty-six I should say.|sd|2792
A|Yeah,|b|2792
A|boy I had thirty-three hundred dollars damage done on my car,|sd|2792
A|a lot of people had their cars totaled just from hail.|sd|2792
B|Oh, wow.|ba|2792
A|I think State Farm went bankrupt. Just about|sv|2792
B|Oh, jeez.|ba|2792
A|But, uh,|%|2792
B|I know the whole situation is bad up here,|sd|2792
B|we're having a terrible time with the recession.|sd|2792
A|Really?|bh|2792
B|Yeah,|ny|2792
B|yeah.|ny|2792
B|It's not good at all.|sd|2792
A|Huh.|b|2792
B|I know things are pretty booming down there.|sv|2792
B|I heard they sold Johnson City though .|sd|2792
A|Yeah,|aa|2792
A|and Colorado Springs.|sd|2792
B|And Colorado Springs?|qy|2792
A|Yeah,|ny|2792
A|I talked to a guy on the phone on this the other day|sd|2792
A|and he was telling me about it.|sd|2792
B|Oh, wow.|ba|2792
A|They just sold it.|sd|2792
B|Amazing.|ba|2792
A|Closed up and moved down to McKinney.|sd|2792
B|Oh, well, that's good.|ba|2792
B|At least they kept the business part of it.|sv|2792
A|Yeah.|b|2792
B|It's scary though I'm telling you.|sv|2792
A|I know .|aa|2792
B|I don't know,|h|2792
B|and, well, you know, with the other part of this thing was, how do you feel that this influences family.|sd|2792
A|How do I feel what?|br|2792
B|That, that books influence,|sd|2792
B|do you know how to use them in your life or to influence,|sd|2792
A|Uh-huh.|b|2792
B|I, I feel like it's important for young children to read too. And what you read to them.|sv|2792
A|Yeah.|b|2792
B|When my children were younger, of course,|sd|2792
B|they were all married and grown|sd|2792
B|and I have grandchildren now,|sd|2792
B|they were, uh,|%|2792
B|I, I read to them a lot.|sd|2792
A|That's good.|ba|2792
B|And, uh, I think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also.|sd|2792
A|That's|ba|2792
A|yeah.|b|2792
B|I'm not saying they read all the right things|sd|2792
B|but they do read. Uh, where a lot of people don't have any interest in it at all,|sd|2792
B|and I think it's important,|sv|2792
A|Oh, yeah.|b|2792
B|because, uh, even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens, I mean, they don't learn anything.|sv|2792
B|It's because they can't read.|sv|2792
A|Yeah,|aa|2792
A|it's really surprising how many people graduate from high school,  and that I work with|sd|2792
B|Yeah.|b|2792
A|and people, I mean,|%|2792
A|I get memos all the time across my desk|sd|2792
A|and things are misspelled|sd|2792
A|and,  it's really,  It's pretty sad.|sv|2792
B|Oh, it's unbelievable,|ba|2792
B|isn't it?|^g|2792
B|Yeah.|b|2792
A|A lot of people that work for me that can't even spell or read, you know.|sd|2792
B|Exactly,|aa|2792
B|and I think that that's why reading is so important,|sv|2792
A|Yeah.|b|2792
B|because, uh, I think even mentally when you can do some,|sv|2792
