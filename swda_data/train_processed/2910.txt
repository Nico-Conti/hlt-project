B|I think I get most of my news, uh, in headlines from the radio,|sd|2910
B|and then I follow-up by reading the newspaper and news magazines about things that attract my attention.|sd|2910
A|Well, I, I do about the same, I guess, but in a different fashion.|sd|2910
A|I, I, I'm from New York originally|sd|2910
A|and now that I live in Florida,|sd|2910
A|I live in the Florida in the winter and then go back up north in the, in the summertime|sd|2910
B|Uh-huh.|b|2910
A|and I, I feel that the, the only legitimate paper although it might sound, a little elitist is the NEW YORK TIMES.|sv|2910
A|I've always read the NEW YORK TIMES when I was younger,|sd|2910
A|and I try|%|2910
A|now that it has a national edition, I read that.|sd|2910
A|I also read, uh, I, I, I guess I do watch, uh, MCNEIL LEHRER on P B S because I, I lean to that coverage,|sd|2910
B|Uh-huh.|b|2910
A|and, and I guess I'm ,|%|2910
B|I like them|sd|2910
B|but they take so long.|sv|2910
B|I don't always have time|sd|2910
A|Yeah.|b|2910
A|Well, there|%|2910
A|, it's a whole hour show.|sd|2910
A|Actually, it's an hour show each evening,|sd|2910
A|and, and, we, we turn it on when we start dinner.|sd|2910
A|We seem to start dinner around six and finish it up.|sd|2910
B|Uh-huh.|b|2910
A|I find that I'm leaning on, uh,|sd|2910
A|I travel a great deal, uh, even overseas,|sd|2910
A|and I find that I lean on, uh, C N N quite a bit for concise and quick stuff.|sd|2910
A|And, I'm, I, I'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out.|sd|2910
A|I mean, I, I don't believe everything they say,|sd|2910
A|but it's, it's coverage, you know.|sv|2910
B|Yeah,|aa|2910
B|I think C N N does a pretty good job.|sv|2910
B|I had not watched them very much except when I was abroad, until the Gulf War.|sd|2910
A|Yeah.|b|2910
A|Yeah.|b|2910
B|And they seemed to have the best coverage.|sv|2910
B|They had more information sooner than, most of the other networks.|sv|2910
A|Uh.|b|2910
A|Well, yeah,|aa|2910
A|I, I, I, uh,|%|2910
A|Peter Arnet was reporting direct from, uh, Iraq.|sd|2910
A|I think this is scandalous the way everybody's picking on him.|sv|2910
B|Yeah.|b|2910
A|I, I think that what he, he reported what he saw|sv|2910
B|Yeah.|b|2910
A|and if you didn't like it, that was just too bad, you know.|sv|2910
B|Well, uh, I know that the coverage he was allowed to present was slanted,|sv|2910
B|but I think they said that frequently enough.   That, uh, you shouldn't criticize the man for giving us one perspective.|sd|2910
A|Yeah|b|2910
A|, oh, yeah,|b|2910
A|I mean, uh.|%|2910
A|No.|aa|2910
B|Uh,|%|2910
A|That, that's right, I think so.|aa|2910
A|And, and I guess when it comes to, um, to magazines, I don't read,|sd|2910
A|I used to when I was younger,|sd|2910
A|I subscribed to TIME and U S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT.|sd|2910
A|I, I have seemed to slide away from that and rely more on the local paper|sd|2910
A|or, I, I, I also subscribe to something called WORLD PRESS, which is a magazine that only talks about other, excerpts from the WORLD PRESS,|sd|2910
B|Uh-huh.|b|2910
A|which sort of gives you a different slant, than,|sd|2910
A|it's not as slanted as the NEW YORK TIMES or as biased perhaps as the local paper.|sd|2910
B|Yeah.|b|2910
A|But, uh, that I guess, and the radio.|%|2910
A|Uh, I listen to P B S radio a lot|sd|2910
A|and I also listen to, uh, these twenty-four hour news stations, when I'm driving.|sd|2910
A|I,|%|2910
B|Yeah,|b|2910
B|we have a C B S twenty-four hour station that I listen to on the way to and from work|sd|2910
A|Yeah.|b|2910
B|and,|%|2910
A|Do you read,|qy|2910
A|are you from Southern or Northern California?|qy|2910
B|Northern.|sd|2910
B|I'm from, uh, the peninsula,|sd|2910
A|So well,|%|2910
A|Yeah,|b|2910
A|is that, what is that,|qw|2910
B|Palo Alto.|sd|2910
A|the San Francisco paper out there is, uh,  the major paper?|qy|2910
B|Well,|%|2910
B|it's horrible.|sv|2910
A|Yeah,|aa|2910
A|and that's a terrible paper.|ba|2910
B|The San Francisco paper is just wretched.|sv|2910
B|So I subscribe to the SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS.|sd|2910
A|Is that pretty good?|qy|2910
B|Palo Alto is about midway between.|^h|2910
B|Well it's a whole lot better than that San Francisco paper|arp_nd|2910
B|and,|%|2910
A|Oh the, what is that, the CHRONICLE isn't it?|qy|2910
B|Yeah,|ny|2910
B|there's the CHRONICLE, and the EXAMINER,|sd|2910
A|Oh.|bk|2910
B|but they're, uh, both run by the same|sd|2910
A|Oh yeah,|b|2910
A|they they really are probably the worse papers I've ever read.|sd|2910
A|I, uh, uh,|%|2910
B|They're just horrid|sv|2910
A|Yeah.|b|2910
B|so we read,|%|2910
A|Well, can you get the L A paper up there?|qy|2910
A|That's a pretty decent paper isn't it|qy|2910
A|or,|%|2910
B|Uh, we can,|na|2910
B|but I don't like it.|sd|2910
A|Yeah.|b|2910
B|So we subscribe to the NEW YORK TIMES and the WALL STREET JOURNAL and uh, MERCURY NEWS.|sd|2910
A|Yeah.|b|2910
A|Yeah.|b|2910
A|Well that's another one I read,|sd|2910
A|I forgot that.|sd|2910
A|I read the WALL STREET JOURNAL,|sd|2910
A|not as in depth as I used to, because they, their articles seem to be getting even longer and longer|sd|2910
A|but,|%|2910
B|Yes,|b|2910
B|well again, I read that, uh, two columns on the front.|sd|2910
A|Yeah.|b|2910
A|I, I think I, I agree with you that the problem seems to be they don't have enough time to do all the stuff.|aa|2910
A|I feel pretty well versed in, in what I'm doing because I, I do spend more time on that than I do, say, on sports, or although I watch that,|sd|2910
B|Uh-huh.|b|2910
A|I spend a lot of time reading about these things.|sd|2910
A|I'm quite interested.|sd|2910
A|I find it very exciting to, for the coverage we have now, today.|sd|2910
B|Yes|aa|2910
B|and I think we do get pretty good coverage.|sv|2910
B|I don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by the, uh, the news coverage.|sv|2910
A|If anything, they, I think they|sv|2910
B|We almost have too much.|sv|2910
A|Well, I don't know,|h|2910
A|I, I hear a lot of criticism about listening to these, the Dan Rathers of the world and, and and taking their word for it, or their comment,|sd|2910
A|actually, they, I think they slant things|sv|2910
A|but,|%|2910
B|Well, I cannot stand Dan Rather.|sd|2910
B|I remember him when he was a local newscaster in Houston.|sd|2910
A|No kidding!|ba|2910
A|Oh, wow!|ba|2910
B|And I hated him then.|sd|2910
A|I didn't know that.|sd|2910
A|Yeah?|bh|2910
B|And I would not watch that man for money.|sd|2910
A|Yeah.|b|2910
B|And he and Barbara Walters just really turn my stomach.|sd|2910
A|Yeah,|b|2910
A|was, was he,|%|2910
B|So I watch Peter Jennings, and, uh and Tom Brokaw. Sort of alternately.|sd|2910
A|Yeah.|b|2910
A|How do you feel about it?|qo|2910
A|I guess I, I got to say, if that's the subject, if the subject is do I feel that we're well enough equipped to,|sd|2910
A|I don't know|h|2910
A|if, if it said that. I feel I'm well enough equipped.|sd|2910
B|Do we get enough news or something like that?|qy|2910
A|Yeah.|ny|2910
A|To,|%|2910
B|Do we get, uh do we get the news that we want?|qy|2910
A|Yeah.|b|2910
B|And I do.|sv|2910
B|I really think.|sv|2910
A|Yeah,|ny|2910
A|I think I do too.|sd|2910
A|I think you have to let, you got to segregate some of it.|sv|2910
B|Yeah.|b|2910
A|Well, that's about all I have to say|fc|2910
B|Okay,|fc|2910
B|well nice to talk to you.|fc|2910
A|Nice talking to you.|fc|2910
A|Bye-bye.|fc|2910
B|Bye-bye.|fc|2910
