A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|4716
A|Um, I guess if I had to rate it from one to ten, I guess, I would rate it a five in the aspect that I wouldn't want everybody to have guns|sd|4716
A|and I think there should be limitations of, like semiautomatics.|sv|4716
A|Uh, things like that should not be just given out to anybody.|sv|4716
A|In fact, you know, I can't imagine anybody having a semiautomatic for what purpose.|sv|4716
A|Uh, so I guess, you know, being that I come from a hunting family I'd rather have some restrictions put on weapons but yet allow hunting rifles, uh, things that people would use for sporting type of, uh, a, activity.|sv|4716
B|Uh-huh.|b|4716
A|Those would be fine|sv|4716
A|but when you get into a, a lot of the more complex weapons, I would say yes|sd|4716
A|we need to put restrictions on them|sv|4716
B|Uh, that's I probably would have to agree with you pretty much all the way I think.|aa|4716
A|Uh-huh.|b|4716
B|Uh, I definitely think that there, some things shouldn't be limited like, like you said, rifles and uh, hunting rifles and possible handguns for people who use them to,|sv|4716
A|Uh-huh.|b|4716
A|Exactly,|aa|4716
A|for self-protection,|sv|4716
A|sure.|aa|4716
B|Right.|aa|4716
B|And, but I think the, I think semiautomatic weapons, people say they use them because it, for sport.|sv|4716
B|But I, I personally cannot see any use for them  other than, uh, for, for, like people who dislike have some sort of crazed you know, ambition to use, have high powered weapons or something.|sv|4716
A|I can't imagine that.|ba|4716
A|Yeah.|aa|4716
A|Uh-huh.|b|4716
A|To do massive amounts of killing, uh,|sv|4716
B|Right.|aa|4716
B|And  I mean, you can only, how much do you|%|4716
A|Yeah.|b|4716
A|The only thing that I can see is the police having it in a case where somebody is, uh, uh, you know, going to kill a massive amount of people or, uh, somebody that's escaping, that's, uh, very dangerous|sv|4716
B|Uh-huh.|b|4716
A|semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch the person and, and, uh, get him down.|sv|4716
B|Right.|b|4716
A|But, uh, you know, I, I think of my family.|sd|4716
A|Uh, they're very much into sporting and, uh, you know, as far as hunting and also like, uh, clay pigeons things like that.|sd|4716
B|Right.|b|4716
B|Uh-huh.|b|4716
A|So they have may have some shotguns.|sd|4716
A|They may have other type of, uh, hunting type things,|sd|4716
A|but I figured if the, if the criminals had to take a hunting gun out to kill somebody, more than likely, somebody would see it, you know what I'm saying  versus a, you know, a small handgun, uh,  that can be, you know, put right in your coat pocket|sv|4716
B|Right,|aa|4716
B|yeah.|aa|4716
B|Yeah,|aa|4716
B|that's true.|aa|4716
A|and nobody would see it,|sv|4716
A|but yet, you can't stop people from having, you know, a handgun in their home.|sv|4716
B|Right.|b|4716
A|Even if there are small children around, there's, you know, you can't say people with small children can't have guns|sv|4716
B|Uh-huh.|b|4716
A|and people without small children that may have grandchildren, you know  still have these guns|sv|4716
B|Yeah.|b|4716
A|but uh, I guess I, I was always taught, number one, a gun isn't a toy.|sd|4716
B|Right.|b|4716
B|Right.|b|4716
A|Uh, you know, and I don't know if that makes a difference if the parent sets down to them and say this gun can kill you, you know  and don't ever play with it.|sd|4716
B|Uh-huh.|b|4716
B|Right.|b|4716
A|Uh, so I don't know if that makes a difference or what|sd|4716
A|but,|%|4716
B|Well, I think uh, in that I think that cases like that it's definitely, um, I think if you're to say okay,|sv|4716
B|we have to get rid of them all because you know, they can only, they only seem to do bad, it, it's, uh, it's saying we're|sv|4716
A|Uh-huh.|b|4716
A|The criminals would get them. I mean even if they had to go across border to get them.|sv|4716
B|Right,|aa|4716
B|right.|aa|4716
B|And people who, people who have them and are responsible with them are, are, are being punished|sv|4716
B|and people who and they're saying that people you cannot take care of things yourself or like that you're not smart enough to teach your kids how to, how to, uh, .|sv|4716
A|Uh-huh.|b|4716
A|How to use, you know, to make sure the guns are put up as something as  uh, not a toy.|^2|4716
B|Right.|b|4716
B|Right|b|4716
A|Yeah.|b|4716
A|Because we had guns all over our house when we were kids|sd|4716
B|Uh-huh.|b|4716
A|and not that they were laying on the, uh, couch or anything like that|sd|4716
B|Right.|b|4716
A|but, uh, I never had an interest in them, being in the fact that I knew that guns could kill|sd|4716
B|Uh-huh.|b|4716
A|and I had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns|sd|4716
B|Right.|b|4716
A|and so it was kind of the idea that we knew that a gun could kill and that a gun wasn't a toy|sd|4716
B|Right.|b|4716
A|and, of course we were quite young|sd|4716
A|and we went through, uh, the National Rifle, uh, Club|sd|4716
B|Uh-huh.|b|4716
A|and so we were taught, you know, kind of at a, a good age, ten and eleven and twelve, to sit down with a kid and say okay,|sd|4716
A|if you're going to learn how to shoot a gun, you're going to learn how to do it correctly|^q|4716
A|and you're going to learn how to have safeguards and and know how to protect yourself|^q|4716
B|Uh-huh.|b|4716
A|but yet have this, training so that kids aren't you know,|sv|4716
A|they have to have a certain respect for it.|sv|4716
B|Right.|aa|4716
B|Well I think, I mean we, I grew up in a family|sd|4716
B|and, and my father had two guns|sd|4716
A|Uh-huh.|b|4716
B|because he used to hunt years ago|sd|4716
B|but he stopped before, really before I was old enough to remember.|sd|4716
A|Sure.|b|4716
A|Uh-huh.|b|4716
B|But, and I knew we had the guns in the house|sd|4716
B|and, the time my father was keeping them just for protection at the time|sd|4716
A|Sure,|b|4716
A|yeah.|b|4716
B|but we, it was never, my brothers, sisters nor I never, I mean none of us ever thought well let's go look at the gun|sd|4716
B|or let's go get the gun|sd|4716
B|it was just something you knew was there|sd|4716
A|Yes.|b|4716
B|and it was your father's|sd|4716
B|and you, that was not something you'd go and play, played with at all|sd|4716
A|Yeah.|b|4716
B|and I think maybe, uh, and that's the type of, the thing that should be, you know, stressed.|sv|4716
A|Yeah,|aa|4716
A|I think so|aa|4716
A|and I don't know if the kids nowadays are different than what|sd|4716
