A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|2768
A|Um, I don't have any, I guess, definite views about elderly care.|sd|2768
A|Um, the first thing that comes to mind is kind of those horror movies that you see,  where elderly people are abused and things like that.|sd|2768
B|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
A|I think that's one thing that I would look at if I was putting my grandmother or my mother, uh, in some sort of home.|sv|2768
B|Right.|b|2768
B|Yeah.|aa|2768
B|Yeah.|aa|2768
B|I agree with you.|aa|2768
B|I, um,|%|2768
B|a group that I'm a part of goes once a month to a, um, they call it the Heritage House.|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|It's, it's a nursing home for elderly people.|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|And this particular one has people that are in pretty bad shape.|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|And, um, I watched,|%|2768
B|the interesting thing was I watched this particular one change hands.|sd|2768
B|It started out just being a terrible place for the people,|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|and then a new company bought it,  and came in and remodeled the whole place.|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|Hired new nurses and, uh, just really, just redid it, you know.|sd|2768
A|Just out of curiosity, what, what kinds of things were they doing when they were considered a bad place?|qw|2768
B|Well, to me, it was dirty, for one thing.|sv|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|Uh, when you would walk in, the smell was just,  awful.|sv|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|The, you know, the floors, you could just,  if you're walking on them, feel how filthy they were.|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|Um, there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and, you know, crying,|sd|2768
A|Oh, my goodness.|ba|2768
B|Of course, I don't know how many of them were, you know, not in their right mind.  or how many were,|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
A|In pain or something.|^2|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
B|I just really don't know,|h|2768
B|but I feel like they were neglected.|sv|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|And, um, yeah,|b|2768
B|that was what I was going to say.|sd|2768
B|It sounds like just neglect all over.|sv|2768
A|Right.|b|2768
B|You know, neglect to cleanup.|sd|2768
A|Right.|b|2768
B|I don't really think anyone was being, you know, cruel or,  or trying to mistreat them or anything.|sv|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|I just think they were not doing anymore, you know, than they had to do.|sv|2768
B|And, um, just kind of letting everybody live in a not very good environment|sv|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|But this new company came in|sd|2768
B|and they, like I said, they remodeled the place.|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|And it smells nice when you walk in.|sd|2768
B|And it looks nice.|sd|2768
B|And they got like several new color T V's for the people, And redid the dining room, where they made it, you know, a lot more place for them to be.|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|They made a little patio area where they can go outside.|sd|2768
A|That's great.|ba|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
B|Just, you know, small things that make it seem a lot more homey.|sv|2768
A|Yeah.|b|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
B|And it's like, it's a lot more like an apartment place instead of just, uh,|sv|2768
A|I would, I would personally hate to know that my mother or grandmother or anyone is in a home like that.|sv|2768
A|And my biggest fear would, that they would be, is that they would be lonely.|sv|2768
B|Right.|b|2768
A|And I would like to know that there are, you know, just a lot of activities, like you said, you know, just putting a plant in a room,  You know. Just makes, just brightens and, and,  and just makes them, just a little more active.|sv|2768
B|Right.|b|2768
B|Right.|b|2768
A|Television,|%|2768
B|Uh-huh.|b|2768
A|They can go outside|sd|2768
A|and, just to know that they're not, you know, laying in a room,  looking at gray walls. You know,  that, that's what would just really kill me.|sv|2768
B|Right.|b|2768
B|Exactly.|aa|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
A|I'd like to know that, you know, they have friends there,|sd|2768
B|Right.|b|2768
A|and they have little conversations and things.|sd|2768
B|Right.|b|2768
A|I'd like to know there's a lot of interaction and, maybe some kind of, of activity, little field trips or something.|sd|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
A|I don't know how they would do that.|sd|2768
A|But,|%|2768
B|Well, they, uh,|%|2768
B|this place that we visit, it's really neat.|sd|2768
B|They have, everyday, they have schedules of groups that come in.|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|And they will do bingo.|sd|2768
B|Our group does a church service once a month.|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|And then other groups come in and do the services, you know, other Sundays,|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|So that they have at least one service every Sunday.|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|So there are a lot of things.|sd|2768
B|There are places that have a lot of things for them to do.|sd|2768
B|But you really do have to kind of seek it out, you know,  and make sure that it's not a place like this one was|sv|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
A|I didn't realize that there were groups that go in like that.|sd|2768
A|That's,  really neat.|sd|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
B|Yeah.|aa|2768
B|Yeah,|aa|2768
B|it is.|aa|2768
B|It's real nice.|sd|2768
B|And, um, I know our church does it|sd|2768
B|and there are a lot of other churches,|sd|2768
B|and they are just like civic organizations,  that do.|sd|2768
A|Right.|b|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|And, uh, I have other friends.|sd|2768
B|It's kinds of neat, they take animals over and let the people pet them.|sd|2768
A|Oh.|b|2768
B|Like they also have a dog that maybe needs a home|sd|2768
B|and they will wash it all up,  and make sure it's, it's a friendly animal,  you know. And take it in and let, just let the old elderly people pet the dogs.|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
A|That's great.|ba|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
A|That will be something, you know, they would look forward to if they knew, you know, that the puppy is coming on Wednesday.|sd|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
A|You know, that would be something to look for.|sv|2768
A|That's really neat.|ba|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
A|That really is.|sd|2768
B|I thought that was a real unusual thing, for someone to do.|sv|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|So, yeah,|%|2768
B|there's a lot that can be done.|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|It's just a matter of people not being lazy.|sv|2768
A|Right.|b|2768
B|And, you know, doing the best they can.|sv|2768
B|Again, I don't know what I'd do if it was my own mother or grandmother,  you know.|sd|2768
A|Yeah.|b|2768
A|Putting any of my family in an elderly home, to me would be the very last resort.|sd|2768
B|Right.|b|2768
A|You know, it, um,|%|2768
A|and I know it's hard for a lot of families if you're trying to, to work or trying to take care of your own family,  it's kind of hard to, to because an elderly person sometimes can be totally dependent,  you know, on you.|sv|2768
B|Right,|b|2768
B|Uh-huh.|b|2768
A|And I know that's hard sometimes|sd|2768
A|and,  but it would really have to be a last resort,  because that would just,|sd|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
A|I would feel so guilty.|sd|2768
B|Yeah.|aa|2768
B|Yeah.|aa|2768
B|I would, too.|aa|2768
A|I don't know.|h|2768
B|Yeah,|b|2768
B|right.|b|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
B|I know.|ba|2768
B|I know what you mean.|sd|2768
A|I don't know anyone personally that's in an elderly home.|sd|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
B|Well, I have interesting conversations with a lot of these people because, um, many of them, of course, their minds are not good.|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|And so a lot them have told me exactly the same story, you know,  and tell me something that they did|sd|2768
A|Yeah.|b|2768
A|Yeah.|b|2768
A|Yeah.|b|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|and then the next time I go it's the same thing, you know,  that, just somebody to listen to them.|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
A|Yeah.|b|2768
B|Uh, just seems to make them really feel good.|sv|2768
A|Nod your head and smile at them.|bf|2768
B|Right.|b|2768
B|I'll tell you the people I feel the sorriest for,|sd|2768
B|there's a guy at this particular one I go to,  that I think that he's really an intelligent person,|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|but he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just cannot communicate.|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|And, um, he's blind|sd|2768
B|and he has seizures, you know,|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|I mean, he's just like in a world of his own,|sd|2768
B|and yet he wants so much,  to be around people.|sd|2768
A|Right.|b|2768
B|And if you come over to him, if he can touch your hand, he'll grab it and kiss it.|sd|2768
A|Oh.|b|2768
B|Oh, and he's always got a smile.|sd|2768
B|I mean, he really tries to, brighten up your life.|sd|2768
B|Oh, it's just amazing.|sd|2768
A|Oh.|b|2768
B|But he can't say anything.|sd|2768
B|He can just kind of make noises.|sd|2768
A|That's something, that, if I had to work in an elderly home, I don't think I could do it.|sv|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
A|Like I, I would really like to be a teacher,|sd|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
A|But I don't think I could do it. Because I'm very, very emotional.|sd|2768
B|Me, too.|aa|2768
A|And the minute, I mean, the minute something happens,|sd|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
A|I cry on, I mean, Hallmark commercials.|sd|2768
B|I know.|ba|2768
A|That's just the end of me.|sd|2768
B|I know.|ba|2768
A|And so I mean something real life, I just,|sd|2768
B|Uh-huh.|b|2768
A|I interview a lot of children,|sd|2768
A|I'm an education reporter,|sd|2768
B|Uh-huh.|b|2768
A|and I always go and do an education things.|sd|2768
B|Uh-huh.|b|2768
A|I meet these kids who are, you know, dropping out of school left and right.|sd|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
A|And all the sudden, they're in this program.|sd|2768
A|They're making straight A's,|sd|2768
A|they're going to graduate early,|sd|2768
B|Uh-huh.|b|2768
A|and I'm just, I just want to hug them,  and go, you are just fantastic.|sd|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
A|And, you know, I could just imagine, you know, working in a home like that,|sd|2768
B|Oh, yeah.|b|2768
A|And those people, they're so sweet and,  and so genuine, You know,|sd|2768
B|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|Uh-huh.|b|2768
A|and all they want is just for everything to be happy,|sd|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
A|and you know,|sd|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
B|Oh, it does.|aa|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
B|Yeah,|b|2768
B|it is,|sd|2768
B|it's really hard|sd|2768
B|and,  But one of the neatest things I think though is we always take our kids.|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|I have a three year old and a six year old,|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|and they, um, have gotten comfortable being around these people,  because they've always gone with us,|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|and the people love them.|sd|2768
A|I'm sure.|ba|2768
B|And they want the children, you know, to hug them or hold their hand|sd|2768
B|and, so far, my kids will do it. Just real easily,|sd|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|and I think it's because they've gone since they were real little,|sv|2768
A|Yeah.|b|2768
B|and they've never been afraid.|sd|2768
B|But that's something,|sd|2768
B|to me children,  you know, need to,|sv|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|people need to take groups of children, Because the kids just brighten up their lives.|sv|2768
A|Right.|b|2768
A|Yeah.|b|2768
B|As we walk through the, the lobby they'll all say, bring her here.|sd|2768
B|I want to see her|^q|2768
B|I would love to hold her.|^q|2768
A|And children,|%|2768
A|I mean, usually a of elderly people like to, they like to, uh, share their experiences with the,  with the younger children.|sd|2768
B|Uh-huh.|b|2768
A|They'll be telling them all kinds of stories.  that they don't even know what they mean.|sd|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
B|That's true.|b|2768
A|You know, they feel like they've lived life|sv|2768
A|so they need to share it.|sv|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
A|And I'm sure I'll be like that, too.|sd|2768
B|Well, me, too.|aa|2768
A|Yeah.|b|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
B|It's quite an experience.|sd|2768
A|But, that's great.|ba|2768
A|I didn't know there were such groups.|sd|2768
B|Yeah.|b|2768
B|Yeah|b|2768
B|there are.|sd|2768
B|And, and, uh, it really helps those people, I think.|sv|2768
A|Uh-huh.|b|2768
B|But, like you said, I'd really have a lot of second thoughts before I put any of my own family members there.|sd|2768
A|Yeah.|b|2768
A|Yeah.|b|2768
B|It would be a last resort.|sd|2768
A|And I would hate it if anyone put me in one.|sd|2768
B|Oh, I know.|ba|2768
B|I'm always afraid like, oh,|sd|2768
B|no,|nn|2768
B|what if I lose my mind.|qh|2768
A|Yeah.|b|2768
B|Am I going to end up in a place like that|qy|2768
