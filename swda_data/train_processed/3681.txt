B|Well, I, uh, don't seem to have as much spare time as I used to,|sd|3681

B|Well, I hope you all had as pretty a day today as we did.|sd|3681
A|Well, it wasn't too bad, other than the Cowboys didn't do so hot.|sd|3681
B|Oh, well now, yes|aa|3681
B|I don't think you can blame the weather on that.|sd|3681
B|We had.|%|3681
A|No,|aa|3681
A|just a crummy, well, actually|sv|3681
A|the Lions are pretty good, I'm afraid, they a lot better team than the Cowboys were today.|sv|3681

B|On any given day, they say.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3681
B|Uh, I haven't, I haven't played in a while, but I do, when I get time and it's pretty weather and it's summer I like to play golf.|sd|3681
A|Oh, okay.|bk|3681
A|I, I play that about six times a year|sd|3681
A|and every year I hang my bag up if I get that five or six|sd|3681
A|and I swear, swear that game off for another year,|sd|3681
A|but I always go back to it|sd|3681
B|Oh, I, uh, oh, I take spells,|sd|3681
B|I'm, I'm kind of a compulsive obsessive person|sd|3681
B|and when I start something, I, I go into it a thousand percent|sd|3681
A|I understand that.|ba|3681
B|and then I get, I get burned out on it.|sd|3681
B|But, uh, I do some counted cross-stitch and some painting on shirts.|sd|3681
A|Well, you do lots of stuff.|sv|3681
B|Well, it doesn't seem like I get anything done,|sd|3681
B|but I guess I do|sd|3681
B|and, I, I like to bake.|sd|3681
B|It's just me in the house,|sd|3681
B|so, when I bake it's usually to take out for something.|sd|3681
A|Gosh,|ba|3681
A|I come up there I'll have to stop by and have, try some of your baking.|ad|3681
B|Well.|%|3681

A|So, I, what I said that I wasn't being real facetious about that.|sd|3681
A|I got customers in Oklahoma City and Tulsa and Perry, Oklahoma  and Eda and all that, all that way.|sd|3681
B|Oh, how neat.|ba|3681
B|So you do quite a bit of traveling then.|bf|3681
A|Yes,|aa|3681
A|yes.|aa|3681
A|I,|%|3681
A|about thirty-three thousand miles a year.|sd|3681
A|So.|%|3681
B|Ooh, well that doesn't leave a lot of time for hobbies,|sv|3681
B|does it?|^g|3681
A|Well, I usually,|sd|3681
A|see, we, we have our, our band practice is on Monday night,|sd|3681
A|and during the summer we, uh, we have concerts every Monday night in the park,|sd|3681
A|and, uh, we, we have, you know, some concerts during the year,|sd|3681
A|and, you know, various people in the communities want us to play for things,|sd|3681
A|but those are usually on the weekend,|sd|3681
A|so that isn't too bad.|sd|3681
B|How big is your band?|qw|3681
A|Well, we got, uh, pretty good size band.|sd|3681
A|Not everybody shows up,|sd|3681
A|but if everyone did we'd probably have over a hundred|sd|3681
A|but we only average about forty to fifty people a, you know, usually.|sd|3681
B|Ooh.|ba|3681
B|Well, that's still a pretty good size band.|bf|3681
A|Yeah.|aa|3681
B|It's not like there are four or five of you there.|sd|3681
A|Oh, no,|aa|3681

A|and, uh, we have a lot of,|sd|3681
A|I, I don't pretend to be that good,|sd|3681
A|but there's a lot of people that, uh, you know, are band directors at schools, or have been,|sd|3681
A|or, uh, you know, there some people that are actually music majors.|sd|3681
A|They don't necessarily follow that any more, you know,|sd|3681
A|that isn't necessarily their career,|sd|3681
A|but, uh, we have some extremely good talent in there,|sd|3681
A|and, uh, as a rule, it sounds pretty decent,|sd|3681
A|so|%|3681
A|It's fun.|sd|3681
B|I, I have absolutely no musical ability whatsoever,|sd|3681
B|and I'm always very envious of people who do.|sd|3681
A|Well, I don't know if I have any or not.|sd|3681
A|I, I've always enjoyed it.|sd|3681
A|I sing in a church choir on Wednesday nights when I'm around, and play in the band on Monday nights, and keeps you out of trouble that way.|sd|3681
B|Well, I'm probably one of the few people that the,|sd|3681
