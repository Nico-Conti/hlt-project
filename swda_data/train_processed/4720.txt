A|Uh, I think, uh, actually I'm fairly pleased with the benefits that we have at the, uh, working for a large corporation.|sd|4720
A|And, for me, there's absolutely no question what's the most important benefit I think it's health care.|sd|4720
B|Right.|b|4720
A|It's what,|%|4720
A|I think everybody would say that.|sv|4720
B|Oh, and if you try to get it outside of your corporation, you're going to pay an arm and a leg.|sv|4720
A|Right.|aa|4720
A|Belonging to a group is the, belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you,|sv|4720
B|Right.|b|4720
A|Uh, the, uh,|%|4720
A|sometimes I think it's more important than salary.|sv|4720
B|Uh, do you also get dental?|qy|4720
A|Yes.|ny|4720
A|And, uh, I don't know if I would rank that second|sd|4720
A|but, uh, since I have three boys, uh, it, it can turn out to be important.|sv|4720
A|Yeah,|%|4720
A|you know|%|4720
B|Oh, I know.|aa|4720
A|in a, in a given year, dental dental expenses can really kill you.|sv|4720
B|Now my husband is with, uh, Northwest Airlines|sd|4720
B|and he gets, uh, you know, the full health and dental|sd|4720
B|and, uh, we have four children|sd|4720
B|and what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous.|sv|4720
A|Right.|aa|4720
B|And I don't know how people that don't have it can afford it.|sd|4720
A|Right.|aa|4720
A|It's, uh,|%|4720
B|Or maybe they don't|sv|4720
A|Right,|aa|4720
A|uh, and then, uh, uh, if the cleaning doesn't get you, the orthodony will.|sv|4720
B|That's right|aa|4720
B|That's right|aa|4720
A|Uh, I guess that would be up there.|sv|4720
A|Uh, I'm not sure if I would rank, uh, how I would rank that next to, say compared to retirement|sd|4720
A|or, uh, uh, uh, pretax savings was another thing that I think is a a great, a great benefit .|sv|4720
B|Uh-huh.|b|4720
B|Right.|b|4720
A|And I, I think it's really something that the, uh, the government ought to encourage more because, uh, there are all these complaints about how we're not a saving country  and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in, uh, Germany and Japan. Uh ,|sv|4720
B|Right.|b|4720
B|Well, it's a lot easier to, to save it when you don't get your hands on it first|sv|4720
A|Right.|aa|4720
A|When you have the, when you have the, uh, the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has, and you can, uh, offer some incentive|sv|4720
A|and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up, uh, the savings and the, that you wouldn't otherwise do|sv|4720
B|Right.|b|4720
A|and ,|%|4720
B|Uh, what about, what about, uh, lesser, uh, benefits perhaps for you but for, for the women in the, in the corporation.|qo|4720
B|For example, uh, oh,|%|4720
A|Leave?|qy|4720
B|Yeah.|ny|4720
B|Do they even, do they have father leaves or anything like that?|qy|4720
A|You know, I, I don't think so yet.|ng|4720
A|They may have, uh, just plain parental leave, which either one can take.|sv|4720
B|Uh-huh.|b|4720
A|Uh, I, their, uh, I know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which I think is too short. Uh|sv|4720
B|Oh, I do too.|aa|4720
A|uh, uh, I really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks.|sv|4720
B|Oh, I think, I think it's just a crying shame, uh, for a mother to have to go back to work at six weeks.|sv|4720
A|Right,|aa|4720
A|and, uh,|%|4720
B|She isn't recovered|sv|4720
B|And, uh  the infant needs her desperately,  at that point and time.|sv|4720
A|There ,|%|4720
A|There ought to be, uh, uh, some compromise that could, where, uh, where the person would be guaranteed a, uh, career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position uh, in exchange for a longer period of time.|sv|4720
B|Uh-huh.|b|4720
B|Right,|aa|4720
B|I agree.|aa|4720
A|It's, uh, it's so important to families then|sv|4720
A|and, uh, and yet anybody who's gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up.|sv|4720
B|Oh, sure.|aa|4720
A|Uh,|b|4720
B|Especially in this day and age.|sv|4720
A|That,|%|4720
B|You don't want to start over again anywhere.|sv|4720
A|Yeah,|aa|4720
A|you're right.|aa|4720
A|I think you've put your finger on the one benefit that I, that I would most like to see, uh, changed Uh, the, uh, parental leave.|sd|4720
B|Well, I think they're at, they're they've come a long way.  Uh, at least some companies. Some of them, uh, my girlfriend, in particular, that works for a, a rental car agency|sv|4720
A|Right.|b|4720
B|and, uh, as manager and, uh, they have a very, very poor leave policy|sv|4720
B|and, uh, I just don't know how, how women do it.|sd|4720
B|Particularly, single parents who don't have the support at the other end. Uh,|sd|4720
A|Right|aa|4720
A|They do it by shortchanging their kids.|sv|4720
A|There's no other way. I mean  uh, unless they're part of some extended family which is unlikely. Uh|sv|4720
B|That's right.|aa|4720
B|That's exactly right.|aa|4720
B|Right.|b|4720
A|people moving as much|%|4720
A|And, uh, they just, it's just a terrible choice,|sv|4720
A|you shouldn't have to make it.|sv|4720
B|Uh-huh.|b|4720
A|Uh you're right.|aa|4720
A|And, uh|%|4720
B|One of the benefits we get, of course, is travel|sd|4720
A|Oh, right.|b|4720
A|Boy,|ba|4720
A|would I like to have that.|sd|4720
B|It's wonderful|sd|4720
A|Yeah.|b|4720
B|The only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere|sv|4720
B|but you can't afford to stay once you get there|sv|4720
A|Oh, listen I have friends in a lot of different cities.|sd|4720
A|If you just fly me there,|sd|4720
A|I'll take care of that|sd|4720
B|That's right.|aa|4720
B|You have to have an awful lot of fun|sv|4720
B|just, just getting there, is, has to be half the fun.|sv|4720
A|Right.|b|4720
A|So and, uh, I guess the,|%|4720
