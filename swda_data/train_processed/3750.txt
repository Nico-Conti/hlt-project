B|Yeah.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3750
A|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3750
A|so you enjoy camping?|qy|3750
B|Oh, yeah.|ny|3750
A|Yeah.|b|3750
B|I, uh like you, I haven't done any in quite some time  except for what I call living now which is, which is very close to camping|sd|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
A|Yeah|b|3750
A|Is it?|qy|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
B|Yeah.|ny|3750
B|You know, I, uh, camped in the Boy Scouts|sd|3750
B|and, you know, my dad and I went out sometimes|sd|3750
B|but uh, even my first, uh, eight or nine years of working, I camped almost all of the time because I was in construction.|sd|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
B|And it is cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment add to stress.|sd|3750
A|Yeah.|b|3750
B|I mean, when you have to have it, you have got to have it.|sv|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
B|And, you know, in those those kinds of situations, uh, room rent which is outrageous.|sv|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
A|Yeah.|b|3750
B|So, my buddy and I, we just camped|sd|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
B|And we figured, what the hell,|sd|3750
B|we did it when we were kids|sd|3750
B|and we loved it.|sd|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
B|Of course, we didn't really rough it that much.|sd|3750
B|When, when I was in high school,|%|3750
B|he is a couple years older than me|sd|3750
B|and, uh, he graduated and went off to college|sd|3750
B|and, uh, during the summer we would camp out at the lake.|sd|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
B|But it wasn't very much like camping because we had a refrigerator and a stove|sd|3750
A|Oh, well Yeah.|b|3750
B|You know, I had a little boat house and floated it out on Lake Grapevine.|sd|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
B|And, uh, well, it was fantastic.|sd|3750
B|We would get up in the morning, go skiing, uh,|sd|3750
B|that substituted for a shower|sd|3750
A|Uh-huh|b|3750
B|and then we would go to work and uh, come back to the, uh, you know, boat house at night|sd|3750
B|and, uh, in the afternoon, you know, it is still four o'clock.|sd|3750
B|You have got four hours of day light, good skiing left.|sd|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
B|And, uh, it was great.|sd|3750
A|Yeah.|b|3750
B|But, uh, you know, now all my life is more like camping than not camping really.|sd|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
A|Do you have electricity out there.|qy|3750
B|Oh, yeah.|ny|3750
A|Yeah.|b|3750
A|You've got a phone obviously|sv|3750
B|Well, actually as a matter of fact, they just ran the phone three years ago.|aap_am|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
B|We didn't have a phone.|sd|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
B|They didn't have phone lines.|sd|3750
B|You just couldn't get phones.|sd|3750
A|Yeah.|b|3750
B|And, uh, we are on the, we are third from the end on the electric string.|sd|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
B|So, we are at the end of the mail route|sd|3750
A|Yeah.|b|3750
B|Like I said, we are probably as far as you can get from the Seven Eleven and still be in Texas.|sv|3750
A|Yeah,|aa|3750
A|I guess so, huh.|aap_am|3750
B|But, uh, you know, right now, uh, what we did, my wife and I, is we got a mobile home. One of these twelve by forty-eight's that got repoed, And, uh, swapped them a Cadillac for it and put it out here on the land figuring I would build a house some day, you know.|sd|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
B|I'm in construction|sd|3750
B|and, uh, you know I just had this place you know to shower up while I was you know out here, you know, putting up fence and building a driveway and drilling a well and all that stuff you have to do before you can even put a house in you know.|sd|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
B|And, uh, I came home from work one Friday afternoon|sd|3750
B|and our truck was back.|sd|3750
B|Everything we had was in boxes|sd|3750
B|and my wife said, uh, we're moving.|sd|3750
A|Uh.|b|3750
B|And I said where.|sd|3750
B|And she said out to the trailer.|sd|3750
B|And I said, oh.|sd|3750
B|She said yep|sd|3750
B|and I said okay|sd|3750
A|Uh.|b|3750
B|So, we have been roughing it out here for about three years,|sd|3750
B|but it is not bad.|sd|3750
B|I, we have color T V, microwave you know|sd|3750
A|Yeah.|b|3750
B|it is not horrible,|sd|3750
B|but it's, it's a lot like camping.|sv|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
A|Yeah,|b|3750
A|well I grew up in California, in  in central California right in the valley.|sd|3750
B|Uh-huh.|b|3750
B|Uh-huh.|b|3750
A|So it is a forty-five minute drive to the mountains|sd|3750
A|and, uh, so my dad loved fishing and camping.|sd|3750
A|So we would go up.|sd|3750
A|First, we went up just to, uh, with a Toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and you know cooked our, uh, hot dogs by the fire or whatever.|sd|3750
B|Sure.|ba|3750
A|But then later my mom and dad got a camper|sd|3750
A|so, uh  we have kind of moved up.|sv|3750
B|Became civilized.|^2|3750
A|Yeah.|aa|3750
A|A little bit in the world.|sv|3750
B|Yeah,|b|3750
B|my mom goes camping you know.|sd|3750
B|She takes her, uh, motor home.|sd|3750
B|You know, she's got one of these huge Winnebago's with a refrigerator and air-conditioning, color T V, microwave oven  you know|sd|3750
A|Yeah.|b|3750
B|She just,|%|3750
B|roughing it for me is going to the Holiday Inn and getting a shower. You know.|sd|3750
A|Yeah.|b|3750
B|But, you know, she has a lot of fun.|sd|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
B|And mostly, it is just a way to,|%|3750
B|she, she goes to dog shows.|sd|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
B|See, she shows dogs|sd|3750
B|and, uh, you can sneak a dog into a motel|sd|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
B|but you can't sneak ten dogs into a motel.|sd|3750
A|No|aa|3750
B|So, she, uh, you know, takes the motor home|sd|3750
B|And she made a deal with my dad that she would take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing.|sd|3750
A|Uh-huh.|b|3750
B|And she,|%|3750
B|if he would buy her a motor home|sd|3750
