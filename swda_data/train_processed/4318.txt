A|the one will take,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|4318
A|uh, okay,|b|4318
A|let's see,|^h|4318
A|I guess, uh, I can start.|sd|4318
A|I'm actually, we're actually trying to find one now because our family's growing.|sd|4318
B|Are you really?|bh|4318
A|Yeah.|ny|4318
A|Uh, so I'm looking at, uh, something larger than what we have.|sd|4318
A|We've got, like, an eighty-four Charger that's about gone and a, uh, an eighty-nine Horizon.|sd|4318
A|So, I'm looking for something, uh, littler  bigger,|sd|4318
B|Uh-huh,|b|4318
B|which are both kind of small.|bf|4318
A|yeah.|aa|4318
A|Uh, so we were thinking mini van for a while|sd|4318
A|and, uh, we're looking at, uh, some just four door, five passenger sedans as well.|sd|4318
B|Uh-huh.|b|4318
B|Are you looking for an American car|qy|4318
B|or, you open to buying foreign cars?|qrr|4318
A|Uh, I don't really have a preference either way I guess. You know,|sd|4318
B|Uh-huh.|b|4318
A|it's, you know, it,|%|4318
A|I guess the American cars had a bad reputation|sd|4318
A|but I haven't had any real substantial problems with the ones I've had.|sd|4318
B|Uh-huh.|b|4318
B|Right.|b|4318
B|Personally, I have a Japanese car right now,|sd|4318
B|and I really like it a lot.|sd|4318
B|Uh, I think the Japanese really build good cars|sv|4318
A|Uh-huh.|b|4318
B|and I know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole, uh, you know, buy American, keep American auto workers working right now,|sd|4318
B|but I feel that the Japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our, uh, car manufacturers have for a while.|sv|4318
A|Yeah.|b|4318
B|If I were to buy another car, I would be, uh, I would be partial to buying another Japanese car,|sd|4318
B|but I would also look at American cars,|sd|4318
B|but when I bought the car that I bought now, I did that also|sd|4318
B|and I just felt that the Japanese car was a much better product.|sv|4318
A|Yeah,|b|4318
A|I mean, even if it's just details, it seems like, uh they, you know,|sv|4318
B|So, if I were,|sd|4318
B|Right.|b|4318
A|I|%|4318
A|there's a door seal that doesn't quite seal|sd|4318
A|and you have to take it back every once in a while.|sd|4318
A|It's clearly just a, a design problem there.|sd|4318
B|Right,|aa|4318
B|it is.|aa|4318
B|Uh, I'm kind of,|%|4318
B|right now,|%|4318
B|the next car I buy is going to be sort of a sports car.|sd|4318
B|I would really like to have a sports car.|sd|4318
B|Uh I don't really, I don't have a family,|sd|4318
B|so I don't need a, a mini van or such to, uh, haul people around in.|sd|4318
A|Uh-huh.|b|4318
B|So I'm looking for more a, a two passenger car that, uh,|sd|4318
A|Oh, like a Miata or something like that?|qy^d|4318
B|Well, I like the Miata,|^h|4318
B|but I don't like it enough to buy it.|ng|4318
B|I would buy something,|sd|4318
B|actually the, the car that I really like right now is an Eagle Talon, which is an American car.|sd|4318
A|Um.|%|4318
B|But, uh, something along that lines.|sd|4318
B|Uh, because I have a, an economy car right now, which is okay,|sd|4318
B|but uh, I think I, I'd like to move on to something a little better.|sd|4318
A|Yeah.|b|4318
A|interesting.|ba|4318
A|Yeah,|%|4318
A|I guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because I look for, you know, size and safety, and then mileage.|sv|4318
B|Right.|b|4318
A|Probably,|%|4318
B|Right.|b|4318
A|Uh,|%|4318
B|That's,|%|4318
B|when I bought the car that I bought, I was looking for mileage,|sd|4318
B|and I was looking for, uh, dependability and something that was going to last a long time. I was that I would get a, for the money that I was going to spend, that I would get a return that was, that was worth that money.|sd|4318
A|Yeah.|b|4318
B|So,|%|4318
A|Yeah|b|4318
A|I I think in terms of computer terminology, I look at, you know, price performance and things like that.  And then a little bit at life expectancy, I guess,|sd|4318
B|Right,|aa|4318
B|exactly.|aa|4318
A|but it, you know depends on what you, what you pay initially.|sv|4318
B|Yeah.|b|4318
A|But, you know I've got a hundred and twenty-five thousand miles on the Charger.|sd|4318
B|That's right.|aa|4318
A|Actually it was my wife's car that she brought into the marriage|sd|4318
B|Uh-huh.|b|4318
A|and she got just a commute between Cincinnati and Dayton.|sd|4318
B|Uh-huh.|b|4318
A|It's, you know,|%|4318
A|we, we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles,|sd|4318
A|but uh, the other ninety four thousand have been just fine with it,|sd|4318
B|Uh-huh.|b|4318
A|so, But, uh,|%|4318
B|Okay.|b|4318
B|Uh, I've had, uh, I've had one or two American cars I think,|sd|4318
B|and, and they were okay.|sv|4318
B|I had a Pontiac once|sd|4318
B|and, and I never had a problem with it,|sd|4318
B|but, uh, my mother had a Dodge at one point|sd|4318
B|and I, I had driven it a few times|sd|4318
B|and I really did not feel that it, that I would buy a Dodge just from,|sd|4318
A|Um.|%|4318
B|well, actually, I had a, uh, a Dodge Omni at one point|sd|4318
A|Uh-huh.|b|4318
B|and that was, I think, what really prejudiced me against American cars was because I did not feel that it was a very quality, uh, car.|sv|4318
A|Yeah.|b|4318
B|So, I guess you'd have to say, if I was looking, I would definitely be looking for a foreign car.|sv|4318
A|That's interesting.|ba|4318
A|But,|%|4318
A|yeah,|%|4318
A|it, it's hard to beat some of the,|sv|4318
A|uh, like, I guess, in particular, we're looking at a, like a ninety-one Corsica, uh, buy back at a, they say G M sponsored auction,|sd|4318
A|but I think they're obliged to have these things because Hertz and Avis and those folks have it in their contract that they can sell it back to G M after, you know, it's, after they've used it for six months and put you know, twelve or fifteen thousand miles, on it|sd|4318
B|Uh-huh.|b|4318
B|Right.|b|4318
A|and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you,|sd|4318
B|Which is a good deal.|sv|4318
A|Yeah,|aa|4318
A|because I guess, uh,|%|4318
A|I mean, well, ninety-twos, granted, but the new ones, you know|sd|4318
B|Uh-huh.|b|4318
A|fourteen to sixteen is what they go for on the lot,|sd|4318
B|Right.|b|4318
A|so all the depreciation has been taken off|sd|4318
A|and, the dealer comes out okay you know,|sd|4318
B|Yeah|b|4318
B|that,|%|4318
A|don't what kind of, I don't know what G M corporate, kind of hit the, I don't know what kind of hit they take on it,|sd|4318
A|but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it|sv|4318
A|and So, but, uh, I don't know,|h|4318
B|Yeah,|aa|4318
B|I'm sure they did.|sv|4318
A|we keep looking at that mini van.|sd|4318
A|It's just, you know,|%|4318
A|we can get a, like a Caravan for, twelve, five|sd|4318
B|Uh-huh.|b|4318
B|Right.|b|4318
A|but that's a little bit more than we want to spend right now.|sd|4318
A|But, uh, uh, it's interesting,|sv|4318
A|but, uh, I don't know,|h|4318
A|if, if, uh, it seems to be,|sv|4318
