A|Okay, um,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|2631
A|I have two children|sd|2631
A|and they're older now,|sd|2631
A|but, um, I found it very difficult to find good child care when I was looking for a place to for stay while I thought school,|sd|2631
B|Uh-huh.|b|2631
A|and, um, I wanted when they were very young when they were babies say till they were about two years old I preferred that they had an individual take care of them in a home|sd|2631
A|and that's what I looked for|sd|2631
A|and I was lucky enough to find one right across from my school,|sd|2631
A|and that worked.|sd|2631
B|Well, that's good.|ba|2631
A|Yeah,|aa|2631
A|that worked out real well|sd|2631
A|but when they got older I wanted them to be in a school type situation, three, I think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and,  and be around kids their own age because I think that's that, that would prepare them for school also, it's real important ,  that they do that, um, that they get that preparation for school,|sd|2631
B|Uh-huh.|b|2631
B|Yes,|aa|2631
B|yeah.|aa|2631
B|Uh-huh.|b|2631
A|so|%|2631
A|but I had,|%|2631
A|I have switched schools several times because I, I really didn't care for what was going on at that the school.|sd|2631
A|I wanted them to learn to play I didn't academics forced on them at an early age.|sd|2631
B|Yeah,|b|2631
B|I, um,|%|2631
B|that, that's,|%|2631
B|oh, oh, you mean you switched schools for the kids.|bf|2631
A|Yeah,|aa|2631
A|for the for the kids.|b^m|2631
B|Uh-huh.|b|2631
A|Yes.|b|2631
B|well, I'm just recently married.|sd|2631
A|Uh-huh.|b|2631
B|So I don't have any children. Though we plan on having them soon|sd|2631
A|Okay.|b|2631
B|but I think, um, that I, that that's probably one of the biggest difficulties, uh,|sv|2631
B|I think, um, I'm lucky though that, um, my wife will probably not have to work while our children,  are under four,  or five.|sd|2631
A|Oh.|b|2631
A|Wonderful.|ba|2631
B|Yeah,|b|2631
B|I'm a college professor,|sd|2631
A|Oh,|b|2631
B|so,|%|2631
A|great.|ba|2631
B|and that's also,|%|2631
B|and it's nice for me because, um, most of the time you have so, so much flexible hours so that I could probably work two or three days a week,  and then one or two evenings,  so that if my wife does, um, does go back to work part time, um, there probably will be a possibility that I could stay home two days that she would go to work and that I would have to teach at night.|sd|2631
A|Um.|b|2631
A|Great.|ba|2631
A|Oh that's, wonderful.|ba|2631
B|Yeah,|aa|2631
B|so it will probably workout real nice for us, uh,|sd|2631
A|Yeah.|b|2631
B|I think we're very lucky because just my job sort of builds in flexible schedules,|sd|2631
A|That's wonderful.|ba|2631
B|I can even teach on Saturdays and,  and things, like that.|sd|2631
A|Oh,|b|2631
A|great,|ba|2631
B|Yeah,|b|2631
B|um, I do know that my brother and his wife have a terrible time finding, uh, child care,|sd|2631
A|Right.|b|2631
B|and one of the things they made in, um, uh,|sd|2631
B|real|%|2631
B|they're number one priority was that, um, they're children didn't have to leave their home *transcript error--spelling of initial "they're" should be "their"|sd|2631
A|Oh, that's,  wonderful too,|ba|2631
B|So,  they, um, um,|%|2631
B|my sister-in-law is a, uh, um, a clinical speech pathologist,|sd|2631
A|Uh-huh.|b|2631
B|so, she is|sd|2631
B|I guess her most recent position after she returned back to work, she applied for a director's position and got it.|sd|2631
B|So, I guess she's very well qualified for her field I guess|sd|2631
B|and even though she took off two years for, um,|sd|2631
B|I guess four years all together,|sd|2631
A|Uh-huh.|b|2631
B|it would be three years,|sd|2631
B|how old's Kayla|t1|2631
B|three, yeah,|t1|2631
B|I guess she took off three years all together, um, for cause I guess they have a four year old,|sd|2631
B|and yeah, and my nephew is two, almost two,|sd|2631
A|Uh-huh.|b|2631
B|so I guess she took off three all together|sd|2631
B|and then when she decided to go back to work, um, she was able to find good position and pay for somebody to come into their home.|sd|2631
A|Oh, that's wonderful.|ba|2631
B|Yeah,|aa|2631
B|I think they were really lucky there,|sd|2631
B|but I think they've lost this woman she she will not continue.|sd|2631
A|Oh, dear.|ba|2631
B|And, and she won't do it in the summer because her kids are home from school.|sd|2631
A|Sure,|b|2631
A|yeah.|b|2631
B|So I don't know what they are going to do.|sd|2631
A|Oh, you know that's an ideal situation,|sv|2631
B|Uh-huh.|b|2631
A|but not many people can afford,  something like,|sd|2631
B|Yeah,|aa|2631
B|I think,  I think they they're both, they were both professionals unlike me they're, um, they were married, my brother's five years younger then she is,|sd|2631
A|Uh-huh.|b|2631
B|so she was probably twenty-seven when they were married,|sd|2631
A|Uh-huh.|b|2631
B|so she already had, had gotten bachelors and masters and established herself in a,  in a practice almost. Um, where, you know, he then they waited a couple years|sd|2631
A|Sure.|b|2631
A|Uh-huh.|b|2631
B|and, and he got himself pretty far along, I guess they didn't have kids until he was about, twenty twenty-six|sd|2631
B|so by that time she was so well established, you know,  I guess it made it a lot easier.|sd|2631
A|Right.|b|2631
A|Sure.|b|2631
B|but, uh, I think the longer you wait the easier, the easier it is,  if you have that, that professional occupation where you can change.|sv|2631
A|Oh, I do to.|aa|2631
A|Oh, yeah,|aa|2631
B|Yeah.|b|2631
A|but they're they're are just so many people out there that aren't that, uh,  lucky, uh,|sd|2631
B|Yeah.|b|2631
B|That's right,|aa|2631
B|that's true, yeah.|aa|2631
A|uh, because I'm a single parent,|sd|2631
B|Uh-huh.|b|2631
A|and I, uh, you know, my husband and I, ex-husband and I got a divorce, um, when the children were small|sd|2631
A|and so I, uh, was a teacher|sd|2631
A|I, uh, still am teacher,|sd|2631
B|Uh-huh.|b|2631
A|and it was really difficult to find affordable child care that was that was what I wanted,  where I could,  have piece of mind and when I taught school * transcriber spelling error--"piece" should be "peace"|sd|2631
B|Yep.|b|2631
B|Yeah,|aa|2631
A|and I knew my kids were being taken,  care of.|sd|2631
B|Yeah.|b|2631
A|Yeah,|b|2631
A|and, uh, plus I, I, uh, wanted them to get something out of it,  I just didn't want it to be a day where they went and slept and ate cookies and,  that's it .|sd|2631
B|Uh-huh.|b|2631
B|Yeah|b|2631
B|that,|%|2631
B|yeah,|aa|2631
B|that's, you know, that's so important I, um, I, I guess it's so funny now with schools, you know, they don't take kid into kindergarten, and when, I guess when they're five,|sv|2631
A|Uh-huh.|b|2631
B|and sometimes they flunk kindergarten now.|sd|2631
A|Right.|b|2631
B|They don't let them into kindergarten unless they can count to ten and know their A B C|sd|2631
B|and I think that's so funny because, um, I don't, I don't know if I want|sd|2631
A|Sure.|b|2631
B|and I,|%|2631
B|it's a very important part of your life|sv|2631
B|and I hope to read with my kids,|sd|2631
B|but I don't know if I want my kids to go to school. At four,  or three,|sd|2631
A|Well.|%|2631
A|I agree with that.|aa|2631
B|you know, I can see that when you make that point.|sd|2631
A|Well, the thing is,  I teach this grade and I, I can see very readily the kids that didn't never learn socially how to get along with other,  children|sd|2631
B|Yeah.|b|2631
B|Uh-huh.|b|2631
A|and they're the ones that are having problems not only getting along with the other kids but academically,  because they were not, they're should be, there's to many things in their way, *to should be too|sd|2631
B|Uh-huh.|b|2631
B|Yep,|b|2631
B|uh-huh.|b|2631
A|and so I want my|sd|2631
A|I wanted my children|sd|2631
A|and they did learn to get, to get along with other people.|sd|2631
B|Uh-huh,|b|2631
B|that's a really important point.|sv|2631
A|Yeah,|aa|2631
A|and I mean I feel a lot of maladjusted adults|sv|2631
A|and I bet if we trace back to their,  early childhood we could see some, you know, times they didn't get to play or be with other kids their own age really learn how do get along with,  people.|sv|2631
B|Yep.|b|2631
B|I think that's really, that's important|sv|2631
B|I, I've seen the same thing|sd|2631
B|I, I think you're exactly right because, you know, I've gone|sv|2631
B|or|%|2631
B|before I was married I went out with a girl,|sd|2631
B|and you know, um, boy, after, you know, after about two months I realize this girl really has some deep set emotional problems.|sd|2631
A|Uh-huh.|b|2631
B|And I bet,|sd|2631
B|and they could be traced back to just not being, uh, you know, being moved between day care centers when she was one and two and three years old,  and never, always being a bit snippy and spiteful.|sd|2631
A|Uh-huh.|b|2631
B|I bet you could trace all the way back|sv|2631
A|I bet you could too,  because it, you know, kids have to learn how to get along with other people,|sv|2631
B|Yeah.|b|2631
B|Uh-huh.|b|2631
A|and if they don't they just don't turn out to be really, you know, good adults or,  successful adults I should say,|sv|2631
B|That's true,|aa|2631
B|yeah.|aa|2631
B|Uh-huh.|b|2631
A|you know, really|%|2631
A|but, uh, it is a big problem|sv|2631
A|and you I have lot of friends right now that, uh, have young children|sd|2631
A|and they daily have problems with, with whoever is taking care of the child,|sd|2631
B|Uh-huh.|b|2631
A|or they switch a lot, which is not good for the child either.|sd|2631
B|Yep,|aa|2631
B|that's true.|aa|2631
B|Yeah,|aa|2631
B|that's really true.|aa|2631
A|So you need,|%|2631
A|cause you need that consistency when they're young like that,|sv|2631
A|and it would be ideal like you, you hope when you have children,  your wife gets to stay home,|sv|2631
B|Uh-huh.|b|2631
B|Yeah.|b|2631
A|I would have, have given anything if I would have been able,  to stay home with my children.|sd|2631
B|Yeah,|b|2631
B|I, I think I'm, I'm very lucky.|sd|2631
A|Yeah,|aa|2631
A|you.|%|2631
B|Um, because of having, you know, flexible higher education provides a flexible schedule.|sd|2631
A|Right.|b|2631
B|I teach a computer classes|sd|2631
B|so,  it's, it's one of things where I'm paid a little bit better then a History or an English professor|sd|2631
A|Oh, great.|ba|2631
B|and I'm also, um, you know,|sd|2631
B|they have vocational type courses on weekends,  almost everywhere,|sd|2631
A|Uh-huh.|b|2631
A|Uh-huh.|b|2631
B|and, you know, you can take you can teach two three hours classes on a Saturday,  which means,  that, you know, whole week's worth of courses|sd|2631
A|Oh, that's,  wonderful.|ba|2631
B|so that lets you be available three days during the week,  you know,|sd|2631
A|Oh, great.|ba|2631
B|so you be will home with your kids I you know|sd|2631
B|it's really funny is that I, I picked this career when I was in college because, uh, I think with my commitment to family and, um,  wanting to spend more time with my children,  because my dad had very, um, nine to five type job,  with, uh, forty-five minute commute into the city, and a forty-five commute home,|sd|2631
A|Um.   You're very wise.|sv|2631
A|Uh-huh.|b|2631
B|so, by the time he got home he was so tired|sd|2631
B|and he was all rung out from the day,|sd|2631
A|Sure.|b|2631
B|and I think he, he missed a lot of, um, our up bringing.|sd|2631
A|Sure.|b|2631
B|You know, my mother|sd|2631
B|I, I came from a family, that my mother stayed home until we started school.|sd|2631
A|Uh-huh.  thirteen and a sixteen year old.|b|2631
B|Um, and I, I don't, uh,|%|2631
B|It's probably costing you a fortune.|sv|2631
A|Oh it is,|sd|2631
A|they really are expensive,|sv|2631
A|yeah.|%|2631
B|My goodness, if, if you want them to be able to drive the car, the insurance bill.|sd|2631
A|Exactly.|aa|2631
B|um,|%|2631
A|Well, and they|%|2631
A|most of the area where we live in most of the kids have cars.|sd|2631
B|Oh.|b|2631
A|So, you know, right now I'm looking for a little truck for my for my son,|sd|2631
B|Uh-huh.|b|2631
A|so that you know an older, older, older, truck|sd|2631
A|so I can afford it,|sd|2631
B|Yeah.|b|2631
A|but, you know, I, I just look forward to him helping me out because I for years just car,  drove in carpools all over the place|sd|2631
B|Carpools, uh,|^2|2631
A|and, And it will be nice just to be able to have him say will you go to the store, will you take his sister somewhere,  something like that.|sd|2631
B|Yeah,|b|2631
B|my parents did a lot of that.|sd|2631
B|That's right.|aa|2631
B|Yep.|aa|2631
B|And just to save you trips to and from,  you know, uh, ball games and athletic events,  and activities at the school.|bf|2631
A|Right,|aa|2631
A|exactly.|aa|2631
A|Right.|aa|2631
A|That's right.|aa|2631
B|Yeah,|b|2631
B|isn't that something how, you know, you think about child care|qh|2631
B|and it lasts along time. *along a long|sd|2631
A|It, does for ever.|sd|2631
B|It, it lasts a long time.|sd|2631
A|And then when you get through with your own you've got grandchildren,|sd|2631
A|so|%|2631
A|It's not ending is it|qy|2631
A|You think we've talked a long, a long enough time?|qy|2631
A|Oh, they come in, see this is the first time I've done this.|sd|2631
A|Oh, in ten minutes, you have to talk that long.|qy|2631
B|Well, you don't have to|ng|2631
B|but they,  they,|sd|2631
A|Uh-huh.|b|2631
B|um, you go the length|sd|2631
B|and sometimes if it's a very busy time period you'll go about seven minutes.|sd|2631
A|Oh.|b|2631
B|Depends on how old the tapes are at that time.|sd|2631
A|I see.|bk|2631
B|Uh-huh.|b|2631
A|I see.|bk|2631
B|Yeah.|b|2631
A|Are you from the,|qy|2631
A|where are you from?|qw|2631
B|This is Baltimore, Maryland.|sd|2631
A|Oh, my gosh, I'm from, uh, Plano, Texas which is, which is outside of Dallas.|sd|2631
B|Yeah,|b|2631
B|well, most of most of the people I talk to are from Texas.|sd|2631
A|Yeah|b|2631
A|because that's where T I is|sd|2631
B|Uh-huh,|aa|2631
B|yeah,|aa|2631
B|and I've discussed,  I've discussed, um.|sd|2631
A|That makes sense.|ba|2631
