A|Go ahead.|ad|2884
A|So Ken, how do you do your family budget?|qh|2884
B|Well, we don't actually have a budget, budget per se.|sd|2884
B|What we do is, uh, maintain a normal checkbook. You know, like, everyone in the world does, I guess,|sd|2884
A|Huh-uh.|b|2884
B|and occasionally it actually balances,|sd|2884
B|And, um, we also, we, um, we have a, a U S Air and Visa card.|sd|2884
A|Huh-uh.|b|2884
B|Every, every dollar we, every dollar we charge is a mile for our frequent flier mileage.|sd|2884
A|Oh, yeah.|b|2884
B|It's a real good deal actually, if you charge a lot.|sd|2884
B|So what we, what my wife and I have taken to doing is charging everything in sight.|sd|2884
B|Anything we buy, we charge, including groceries and so forth.|sd|2884
A|Huh-uh.|b|2884
B|So what we'll do is,|sd|2884
A|Well, then you just pay it off at the end of the month?|qy|2884
B|Right.|na|2884
B|We actually maintain a,|sd|2884
B|we have, a, we, we, we, we have a checking account that we treat like a savings,|sd|2884
B|scratch that,|ad|2884
B|we have a savings account that we treat like a checking account.|sd|2884
A|Huh-uh.|b|2884
B|And so what we do is, we anytime we do or make or charge something, we write it out as if we wrote a check.|sd|2884
A|Huh-uh.|b|2884
B|And then at the end of the month all the money to covered already.|sd|2884
B|So we just pay it off without having to worry about any interest or anything.|sd|2884
A|Oh.|b|2884
A|That's a real good idea.|ba|2884
B|It keeps us hopping.|sd|2884
A|Yeah.|b|2884
A|See, now I'd never get my wife to be able to follow that.|sd|2884
A|Before we got married I had money in the bank.|sd|2884
A|I owned my own home.|sd|2884
A|I put in so much money, each, you know, month towards long term savings, you know, like in, uh, mutual funds and things, you know,|sd|2884
B|Huh-uh.|b|2884
A|and, uh, after I got married,|sd|2884
A|no,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|2884
A|it just didn't work anymore.|sd|2884
A|She spends a lot.|sd|2884
A|She likes to spend on anything and everything With body lotion, everything|sd|2884
A|So, we really haven't, we don't have a good organized system, yet.|sd|2884
A|Maybe after awhile I'll rub off on her or something|sd|2884
A|I don't think,|%|2884
B|Well, you know, you know, you know, what's always good is sort of a for savings , where they just take money out of you're pay.|sv|2884
A|Yeah.|b|2884
B|We did that for awhile where, um,|sd|2884
B|we actually still do it with, with my wife's salary,  where we put it, we have a separate, a third account even, a savings account in, in an entirely different bank where what we do is take money out of her paycheck every week.|sd|2884
B|I'm a graduate student.|sd|2884
A|Yes.|b|2884
A|So am I.|sd|2884
B|Oh, really.|b|2884
B|In what field?|qw|2884
A|Well, uh, in information systems.|sd|2884
A|I'm a voice researcher.|sd|2884
B|Oh, okay.|bk|2884
B|I'm in, uh, psycholinguistics, actually.|sd|2884
A|Huh-uh.|b|2884
B|Um, but my wife has a real job.|sd|2884
A|Yeah.|b|2884
A|So does mine.|sd|2884
B|Yeah|b|2884
B|What we do is, we take money out of her, out of her paycheck each week.|sd|2884
A|Huh-uh.|b|2884
B|And put it, it goes directly to another account, that we don't, at an entirely different bank, that we don't have access to so easily,|sd|2884
B|and it goes there|sd|2884
B|and it stays there|sd|2884
B|and it builds up until we need it for something.|sd|2884
A|Yeah.|b|2884
A|See, I think we might have to do that|sd|2884
A|Of course, she looks at what she brings home each week.|sd|2884
A|It's going to be hard for her to, uh, not have her own money. Because, like now, you know, I put money in the bank and saved to go back to graduate school for two years.|sd|2884
A|And now she wants to go back to school,|sd|2884
A|but she saved enough maybe to get her through August.|sd|2884
B|Oh.|b|2884
A|You know, and that's it.|sd|2884
A|And I keep saying, now, Laura, you're going to have to save a little money.|sd|2884
A|I don't know if my paltry graduate student fees are going to get us through.|sd|2884
A|It doesn't work, Ken|sd|2884
B|Gee.|b|2884
A|My mother always said, "now, don't argue about money",|sd|2884
A|so we don't.|sd|2884
B|Right.|b|2884
A|But, you know, there goes my savings|sd|2884
B|God.|ba|2884
A|But, you know, it's one of those things.|sd|2884
B|I got lucky.|sd|2884
B|My wife apparently is not a,|sd|2884
B|she likes to spend,|sd|2884
B|but she's pretty good about things.|sd|2884
A|Yeah.|b|2884
A|Now, see my wife will do things like make clothes.|sd|2884
B|Wow.|ba|2884
A|One of our, one of our big investments that, you know, I was wholeheartedly in favor of, was to buy a sewing machine. Because she makes clothes.|sd|2884
A|And, you know, a descent sewing machine will really help her out|sd|2884
A|and she's already made, you know, presents and gifts and things for,  shorts for me and things for the summer.|sd|2884
A|You know, so I guess I can't, you know, we've probably almost paid off the sewing with, uh,  yeah, with the savings from that.|sd|2884
A|So I can't complain too much, you know,|sd|2884
A|she's, she's good about that.|sd|2884
A|And, also, we, we dine at home a lot.|sd|2884
A|You know, she likes to cook.|sd|2884
A|So that saves us from restaurants or whatever|sd|2884
A|but,  but, she does have things where she likes to pamper herself that just to me seem like money dumped down a drain. You know.|sd|2884
B|Right.|b|2884
B|Well, I guess we all have those feelings.|sv|2884
A|Yeah.|b|2884
B|I, uh, I uh, I, I go to, uh,|%|2884
B|I pay what I think is a lot of money to go to a karate class, you know.|sd|2884
A|Huh-uh.|b|2884
A|You know, but you need a hobby.|sv|2884
B|Right.|b|2884
B|Exactly,|ba|2884
B|but that to her is sort of like a waste.|sd|2884
A|Yeah.|b|2884
A|That's true.|ba|2884
B|But she does her nails.|sd|2884
B|So,|%|2884
A|I know,|ba|2884
A|and those nails are so expensive|sd|2884
A|Oh, gosh.|ba|2884
A|I was so excited when she decided she wasn't going to do her nails anymore.|sd|2884
A|I guess she just stopped polishing them because they were yellow.|sd|2884
B|Yeah.|b|2884
A|And then she waits for them to get their color back.|sd|2884
A|And then she'll polish them again.|sd|2884
A|I don't know, whatever.|sd|2884
A|So she stopped for awhile.|sd|2884
A|Boy, what a difference.|sd|2884
A|They buy nail polish every two weeks,|sd|2884
A|it's, uh,|%|2884
A|my gosh,|ba|2884
B|Yeah.|b|2884
A|And lotion, oh, my goodness, body lotion,|sd|2884
B|Oh, yeah.|b|2884
A|we spend more on soft, on, on body lotions with sesame oil and all these different things, than, uh,|sd|2884
A|she must spend more on one application of body lotion than I do on soap for an entire year.|sd|2884
B|Yeah|b|2884
B|Good old Ivory|sd|2884
A|Yeah.|b|2884
A|It's funny.|sv|2884
B|Um, well, it's for your benefit though, right.|qy|2884
A|Oh, I think so,|na|2884
A|she's always soft.|sd|2884
A|That's true.|sd|2884
B|, so that's helpful.|ba|2884
A|Yeah.|aa|2884
A|But I think, um,|%|2884
A|I don't know,|h|2884
A|maybe after we're not in school anymore, we'll be much better at saving.|sd|2884
A|I think, uh,  I think that's, uh,|%|2884
B|Yeah.|b|2884
B|Now do you still own a house?|qy|2884
B|You said you owned one.|sd|2884
A|I sold my house.|ng|2884
A|And that's what's really paying for my time unemployed or whatever. Because the graduate assistantship really doesn't cover, the ten thousand dollars in tuition, really doesn't cover living expenses. Um,|sd|2884
B|That's great.|ba|2884
B|Right.|b|2884
A|we actually live in two different places right now because she has her job.|sd|2884
A|So that makes it hard with, uh, you know,|sd|2884
A|we're paying double rent, double utilities,|sd|2884
B|Oh, wow.|ba|2884
A|and that makes it sort of expensive|sd|2884
A|but see, I live within my,  I live within my very menial income|sd|2884
A|and she doesn't|sd|2884
A|She doesn't live within her professional income, you know.|sd|2884
A|So I just get a,|%|2884
B|that's the killer, two apartments,|sv|2884
A|yeah,|aa|2884
A|and then even if we want to see each other on weekends, it's twenty-five, thirty dollars in gas, every weekend,|sd|2884
A|and that really adds up too, you know,|sd|2884
A|so it gets tough,|sd|2884
B|Wow.|ba|2884
A|I think, we'll, do much better when we're living together and we're only paying one rent and one telephone.|sd|2884
A|You know, it will cut our telephone bills, you know, by five, by four-fifths, you know,   if she's here,|sd|2884
B|Eventually, right.|ba|2884
B|I mean you're not going to,|%|2884
B|Right.|b|2884
A|so it's actually tough this year,|sd|2884
A|but it will be better in June.|sd|2884
A|She will move in with me in June,|sd|2884
A|so hopefully our budget will in increase then.|sd|2884
B|Have you been married for long?|qy|2884
A|No.|nn|2884
A|Just since December.|sd|2884
B|Oh, wow.|ba|2884
B|So you guys really are newlyweds.|sd|2884
A|Yeah.|b|2884
A|We're, very newlyweds,|sd|2884
A|but that's the,|%|2884
A|we, we're together probably for, um, uh, very close for about six months before we got married.|sd|2884
A|So, you know, we lived within,|%|2884
A|though I had my own house and things, you know, we still, uh, we're still pretty close.|sd|2884
A|I knew her spending habits|sd|2884
A|and they're about the same|sd|2884
B|Oh, wow.|ba|2884
A|they haven't changed at all, you know.|sd|2884
A|My mother always said to me, "Tom, now, the best thing to do is be like you're father.|sd|2884
A|Never say a word when you're wife spends money".|^q|2884
A|And I was like, well, that's true my dad never said a word, you know.|sd|2884
B|Yeah.|b|2884
A|So.|%|2884
B|I actually encourage my wife to spend money sometimes. Because I think, you know, um, I sort of feel guilty, you know, given that she makes twice as much as I do.|sd|2884
A|Yeah.|b|2884
B|So I say if she wants to go out and buy something, I never argue with her, because she's real good at, you know, sort of .|sd|2884
A|I don't argue with her,|sd|2884
A|but I just get all,|sd|2884
A|it must show in my face.|sd|2884
A|Must be like, must be cringes or something, you know,  especially yesterday or this past weekend.|sd|2884
B|Yeah.|b|2884
A|We met half way between, at her parents house|sd|2884
A|and, um, she had on a new pair of jeans|sd|2884
A|and she'd gotten all new underwear,|sd|2884
A|and I was like, Laura.  How did you get all this stuff?|sd|2884
A|imitates a woman's "Well, I just got paid."|^q|2884
A|And, and I was like, oh.|sd|2884
B|Had some money in her pocket, yeah.|ba|2884
A|It was there.|sd|2884
A|It was burning.|sd|2884
A|It had to be spent.|sd|2884
A|You know, and I'm like|%|2884
A|and she said everything was on sale.|sd|2884
A|Oh, oh, that's good,|ba|2884
A|at least it was on sale|sd|2884
A|That's good honey,|^q|2884
A|I'm glad you bought it on sale|^q|2884
A|What else can you say?|bh|2884
B|That's right.|ba|2884
B|I do recommend the for savings bit.|sv|2884
B|They, uh, they take it out or your paycheck before you see it because it doesn't hurt.|sd|2884
A|Yeah.|b|2884
A|I think,|%|2884
A|Yeah.|b|2884
A|You don't notice it.|sd|2884
A|I think that's probably a really good idea.|sd|2884
B|You know, you don't even think about it if it's gone.|sv|2884
A|Huh-uh.|b|2884
B|Yeah,|b|2884
B|so, uh, until you really need it|sd|2884
B|and then you realize, you've got a couple of thousand dollars built up someplace else.|sd|2884
A|Yeah.|b|2884
A|Yeah,|b|2884
A|see I was,|%|2884
A|when I had, when I was living alone and I had my own house and things, uh, I put one, I was paid twice a month,|sd|2884
A|one paycheck went into savings|sd|2884
A|and one went into the checking account that paid the mortgage,  and the food bills|sd|2884
B|Right.|b|2884
A|and it,|%|2884
A|and I was even able to, you know, to accumulate some savings in a sense in the checking account, because I'm pretty thrifty|sd|2884
A|and, you know. But my wife likes to spend.|sd|2884
A|She enjoys,|sd|2884
A|so that's fine|sd|2884
A|But a|%|2884
A|for savings , I'll have to look into that.|sd|2884
B|Yeah.|b|2884
B|that's, that's been our godsend, you know.|sd|2884
A|Huh-uh.|b|2884
B|We've had some sort of major emergencies come up, you know, where,|sd|2884
B|we also own our own house,|sd|2884
A|Huh-uh.|b|2884
B|um, we had an ice storm up here,  recently, where it was I mean, it was horrible.|sd|2884
A|Yeah.|b|2884
B|I mean, half the city owned trees .|sd|2884
B|One-third of all vegetation in this county is just wiped out.|sd|2884
A|Oh, really, because of the heavy ice.|qy^d|2884
B|Yeah.|ny|2884
A|It broke the limbs.|sd|2884
B|Exactly.|aa|2884
A|Huh-uh.|b|2884
B|We had to our backyard tremendous willow tree that just fortunately,|sd|2884
B|but it cost us, you know, a couple of hundred dollars just to bring the tree down. I mean, just to take off what was broken.|sd|2884
A|Right.|b|2884
B|Plus, we went with a friend,|sd|2884
B|and they said you know,|%|2884
B|and then the whole ice storm cost us quite a bit of money, even though insurance picked up some of it,  still, not all of it.|sd|2884
A|Yeah.|b|2884
B|They don't get, you know,|%|2884
A|Huh-uh.|b|2884
B|and that,|%|2884
B|plus|%|2884
B|and then we had a car expense like that same week.|sd|2884
B|One of the cars died, you know.|sd|2884
B|All of this adds up|sd|2884
B|and that for savings really comes in handy.|sd|2884
A|Yeah.|b|2884
A|Yeah.|b|2884
A|I can see that.|ba|2884
A|I can that,|%|2884
A|I keep trying to say to her, Laura don't spend so much.|sd|2884
A|What happens if something happens to a car, you know.|^q|2884
B|Right.|b|2884
A|Oh, well, nothing will happen.|sd|2884
A|Oh.|%|2884
