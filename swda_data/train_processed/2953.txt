A|And, you know, I was raised by my sisters and stuff.|sd|2953

A|But I know that it would have been better had Mom been able to stay home with us.|sv|2953
B|That one person that you could always count on being there.|bf|2953
A|Right.|b|2953
A|Right.|aa|2953
A|And my husband was the same way.|sd|2953

A|I want to raise my kids.|sd|2953
A|I do not want a day care or an aunt or anybody else raising them.|sd|2953
B|Well,|%|2953
A|I want to be there to make sure that,|sd|2953

B|I,|%|2953
A|Do you stay home with yours?|qy|2953

B|And she, she hired an au pair, which is a college kid to come in and take care of her two boys while she works in the other end of the house.|sd|2953

A|Let mommy talk.|t3|2953
B|And so,|%|2953
A|Well, I think that's neat.|sv|2953

B|And then my other girlfriend just, you know, tears her hair out and goes at it, you know, twenty-four hours a day, watching both kids all the time.|sd|2953
B|And I think there is a point where you just have to get away.|sv|2953
A|Right.|b|2953
B|And it is good for the kid|sv|2953
B|and it is good for you to develop, you know, your interest so you do not stop growing at the same time.|sv|2953
A|Uh-huh.|b|2953
A|Well, I know the family is really going through changes.|sd|2953

B|Do you have any, uh,|qy|2953
B|do you have your mom or anybody around you that  helps you?|qy|2953
A|Uh,|b|2953

B|Yeah.|b|2953
A|Her husband happened to get a job at T I|sd|2953
A|They moved out here,|sd|2953
A|but|%|2953
A|his family lives here|sd|2953
A|and, my husband was in the service when I met him.|sd|2953
B|Uh-huh.|b|2953
A|And so we, we've been all over|sd|2953
A|to Okay, Kyle|t3|2953
A|Then I,|%|2953
A|he got a sunburn|sd|2953
A|and he is itching,|sd|2953
A|so I am keep having to scratch his back.|sd|2953
B|Oh.|b|2953

A|Outside of, I mean, going,|^2|2953
B|Right.|aa|2953
A|yeah.|b|2953
B|Well, that is,|%|2953
A|I would rather work at home, if I could.|sd|2953
B|Well, see and, and that is, uh, the sort of the thing of the nineties is women working out of their own home.|sv|2953
A|Yeah.|b|2953
A|That is the trend.|sv|2953
A|Yeah.|b|2953
A|They are bringing offices, I mean, I mean big businesses into their home.|sv|2953
A|Bringing their computers home and working from there.|sv|2953
B|Right.|b|2953
B|And I think, you know, the more we try to, you know, shape that, the more input we, have into what that whole system is going to look like. Because that is, that is our choice now too.|sv|2953
B|That is,  that is our cause.|sv|2953
A|Well, I think,  I think one that would be, uh,|sv|2953
A|it is, uh,|%|2953
A|kids could see their parents, you know, how hard they work,|sv|2953
B|Yeah.|b|2953
A|they would understand more.|sv|2953
A|When, uh, we first moved down here, I was working.|sd|2953
A|I was working a twelve hour shift,|sd|2953
A|and it was three and four days a week.|sd|2953
B|Uh-huh.|b|2953
A|And, uh,|%|2953
B|Um.|b|2953
A|oh, my little boy just, he went wild. You know, I mean because, because he had been used to me being there all the time,|sd|2953
B|Being there all the time.|^2|2953
A|yeah.|aa|2953
B|Yeah.|b|2953
A|And he is just now,|sd|2953
A|well, when I got pregnant, I went ahead and quit work and decided just to stay at home|sd|2953
A|and it was costing too much at home, than, more at home than I was bringing in.|sd|2953
A|So,|%|2953
B|Yeah.|b|2953
B|See the economic situation on the whole thing.|sd|2953
B|And then, uh, well it is,|%|2953
B|see we do have things that we are concerned about here.|sv|2953
A|Uh-huh.|b|2953
B|This generation,|sv|2953
B|I don't know.|h|2953
B|Social change is always going to go on,|sv|2953
B|but I think we have taken a big leap in the last, you know, twenty, thirty years.|sv|2953
A|Uh-huh.|b|2953
B|And, uh, nothing is the same.|sv|2953
A|No,|aa|2953
A|it seems like it is totally different.|sv|2953
A|Of course, I do not have much to compare it to.|sd|2953
A|To me,  our causes do not seem as important as you all's were.|sv|2953
B|Well.|%|2953
A|Do you know what I mean?|qy|2953
B|Yeah.|ny|2953
B|But we, we grew, we passed them on to you, you know,|sv|2953
B|I mean,|%|2953
A|You, you what?|br|2953
B|I said, "We passed them on to you."|sd|2953
A|Okay.|bk|2953
A|We passed them on to us.|bf|2953
B|I mean, you know, because it takes a lot of hard work.|sv|2953
B|It takes writing letters to Congressmen and,  and, you know, just being very, very politically astute about how to shape and mold the future.|sd|2953
A|Uh-huh.|b|2953
B|And, and, uh, you know, um, did we make the right choices?|qh|2953
B|We do not know,|sv|2953
B|we will never know.|sv|2953
A|No.|aa|2953
B|I mean, you know, I, I think we made a wrong choice when I look at the children of today.|sv|2953
B|Yeah,|%|2953
B|I think we made some big wrong choices.|sv|2953
A|Okay,|b|2953
A|yeah.|b|2953
B|And I think business got in the way.|sv|2953
B|I think the greed of the eighties got,|sv|2953
