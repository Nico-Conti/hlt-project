B|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3658
A|Okay.|b^m|3658
B|Universal health insurance,|sd|3658
B|right?|^g|3658
A|That's right.|na|3658
A|What would we like to say|qw|3658
A|I think,|sv|3658
A|Uh-huh.|b|3658
A|I think that's what the subject is about.|sv|3658
B|Did you read, uh, the article in the paper today about this particular subject?|qy|3658
A|In the Dallas, the MORNING TIMES?|qy|3658
B|Yeah.|ny|3658
A|I guess I did not.|sd|3658
B|Uh, the state of Washington and the state of Minnesota is, uh, going to begin testing a program, a state funded program for citizens of those two states|sd|3658
B|and there's fourteen other, uh, states that are considering it. Least according to the article in the paper this morning.|sd|3658
B|I think it's a trend that's, that's, that's, uh, probably may go nationwide eventually because I think national health is something that we all need.|sv|3658
B|It's getting to a point that you have to have it,|sv|3658
B|you have to have some form of health insurance.|sv|3658
A|Well, it's been interesting that we,|sv|3658
B|Extremely expensive, though.|sv|3658
A|Yes.|aa|3658
A|So we live in a society, though, where everyone if you ask them on polls, will, uh, say that they think that everyone has a right to health care.|sv|3658
B|Uh-huh.|b|3658
A|And yet, I don't think we've ever quite decided who's really supposed to pay for it.|sv|3658
B|Well, that's the thing, you know,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3658
B|uh, unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are, are paying for the people that don't have health insurance.|sv|3658
A|Which is why people are talking about|sv|3658
A|we ought to just admit it perhaps and then try and somehow subsidize it in a way that's more fair.|sv|3658
B|Yeah.|b|3658
B|I don't think you, uh,|sv|3658
A|You have health insurance?|qy|3658
B|Yes,|ny|3658
B|I do.|sd|3658
A|Through your company?|qy^d|3658
B|Uh, through my company,|sd|3658
B|yes.|ny|3658
B|But I have been in a situation, uh, recently where I was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year|sd|3658
B|and my wife developed cancer.|sd|3658
B|We didn't have any insurance.|sd|3658
A|Oh, my goodness.|ba|3658
B|And it was a go to Parkland type situation.|sd|3658
A|That's must have been hard|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3658
A|How was your care at Parkland?|qo|3658
B|Uh, because it was a life threatening situation, it was very good.|sv|3658
B|Uh, as it, as it turned out one of the top, uh, people, or one of the top doctors in the state that is involved in cancer treatment was at Parkland.|sd|3658
A|But, yet, Parkland is not free, either.|sd|3658
B|No,|aa|3658
B|it's not free,|sd|3658
B|but, uh, It's, it's a situation that because I didn't have any insurance and I was on unemployment, it was paid by the county.|sd|3658
A|Is it affordable?|qy|3658
A|So you did have a good experience.|sv|3658
B|I had a bad experience as it turned out.|ar|3658
B|Uh, I was fortunate that there was Parkland.|sv|3658
A|Is your wife better, I hope?|qy|3658
B|Uh, no she passed away.|ng|3658
A|I'm real sorry.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3658
B|That's all right.|bd|3658
A|Sure. *listen; is this a question?|b|3658
B|That happens.|bd|3658
A|It does happen,|sd|3658
A|but it's very sad.|sv|3658
B|Yeah,|b|3658
B|but in any event, uh, I'm in favor of national health. If I had to vote for it.|sd|3658
A|Well so am I.|sd|3658
A|Actually, uh, I'm a pediatrician|sd|3658
B|Oh, is that right?|bh|3658
A|and I feel very strongly about, uh, children, and, uh, developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic last year. Where we certainly proved that we're not doing a very good job with preventive health care among children and particularly the children who need it most.|sd|3658
B|Uh-huh.|b|3658
B|Uh-huh.|b|3658
A|So, uh, I'm really quite active in trying to, uh, be proactive at least for children's issues.|sd|3658
A|It's very complex, very complicated,|sv|3658
A|but, uh, I strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization, glasses, hearing aids basic health benefits.|sv|3658
B|Well, I, when I grew up and|sd|3658
B|I grew up in south central Kansas, uh,|sd|3658
B|we had,|sd|3658
B|and my mom worked for the health department, the county health department|sd|3658
B|and we had x-rays every year,|sd|3658
B|we had a dentist come to our school and, uh, check our teeth once a year at least.|sd|3658
B|Uh, we had all our flu shots taken care of, our measles, mumps, rubella and all that other stuff.|sd|3658
A|Um.|%|3658
B|And, uh, when my children were growing up, we didn't have that.|sd|3658
B|We had to pay for it, which I wasn't opposed to paying for it.|sd|3658
B|I had the money to pay for it,|sd|3658
B|but I'm sure that there were people that don't.|sv|3658
A|Well, and the costs have, so much has gone up so much.|sd|3658
A|The cost of immunizations for example, uh, and just the legal the legal benefits, uh,|sd|3658
A|that has really forced people into doing a lot of things unnecessarily, et cetera.|sv|3658
B|Uh-huh.|b|3658
A|So, well, I don't know,|h|3658
A|it's, it is interesting,|sv|3658
A|in case you didn't know, Texas leads the nation in uninsured children.|sd|3658
A|Thirty-one percent of all Texas children do not have insurance and are not on Medicaid.|sd|3658
B|Did not know that.|sd|3658
A|So, uh, one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care.|sd|3658
A|And I work in the children's Parkland system|sd|3658
A|and it's pretty overwhelming to me.|sd|3658
B|Uh-huh.|b|3658
A|But, uh, it's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in Dallas county.|sd|3658
