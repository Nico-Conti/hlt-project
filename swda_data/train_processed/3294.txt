B|Well, let's see.|^h|3294
A|So what,  So what gets you?|qo|3294
B|As far as I'm ,|%|3294
B|Well, the thing I think that annoys me the most is, I have, I have young children, a baby in the house|sd|3294
B|and, and inevitably as soon as they're asleep, someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something.|sd|3294
A|Uh-huh.|b|3294
B|And I think that, that is probably the most aggravating|sv|3294
A|Uh-huh.|b|3294
B|Uh, you know, it invades my time.|sv|3294
B|I'm the one that pays for the phone.|sd|3294
B|Uh, if I want to buy something, I'll take the initiative and, and go find it, you know.|sd|3294
B|And that just really does aggravate me.|sv|3294
B|Uh, what do you think?|qo|3294
A|Well, I mean I,|%|3294
A|that's exactly the kind of thing I would have said.|sd|3294
A|Although in my case it's my wife and I both work,|sd|3294
A|we come home|sd|3294
A|and just as we're preparing dinner or eating dinner the phone rings|sd|3294
A|and it's one solicitation call after another|sd|3294
A|and, you know.|%|3294
B|Your time is, is  valuable,|sv|3294
A|Yeah,|aa|3294
A|it's, it's  like you say, very annoying|sv|3294
B|and,|%|3294
A|and, uh, why, why do we let this happen.|qh|3294
B|Oh, I,|%|3294
B|that's, that's interesting.|sv|3294
B|I|%|3294
B|the, the market seems to just be growing, too.|sv|3294
B|I, I guess enough people are not speaking out.|sv|3294
B|I'm not speaking out, that's for sure.|sd|3294
B|I just get aggravated about it.|sd|3294
B|And,|%|3294
A|Would, would you,|%|3294
A|I mean if you could legislate something, what would you legislate?|qw|3294
B|I really don't know.|sd|3294
B|I'm, I'm not into uh, heavy government legislating of a lot of different areas,|sd|3294
B|but I I don't know.|h|3294
B|I just, I do particularly find it annoying.|sd|3294
B|Uh, I'm really not sure. to be,|h|3294
A|Yeah.|b|3294
A|It, it seems, it seems to me that we should have the ability to designate with the phone company that we don't want to receive calls like that. *sv|sv|3294
B|Well, that, yeah, that might,|%|3294
A|And the people making these calls would be obliged to compare the, their lists that they're going to call against this list of people who don't want to be called.|sv|3294
B|Identify themselves, yeah.|^2|3294
B|Right.|aa|3294
B|Well, that would be a good an interesting way,|sv|3294
A|Uh,|%|3294
B|yeah.|aa|3294
A|And, that, that way, those who want it can have it|sv|3294
A|and those who don't want it, don't have to have it.|sv|3294
B|Right.|b|3294
A|Sort of like an unlisted number where you haven't gone to the trouble of enlisting yourself.|sv|3294
B|Right,|aa|3294
B|you're,|%|3294
A|Except even unlisted numbers aren't safe now because they have these things just sort of dial through all the numbers. Uh, automatically|sd|3294
B|Oh, is that right?|bh|3294
B|Oh, that's interesting.|ba|3294
A|and,|%|3294
B|And they just get everybody.|sd|3294
A|Right.|b|3294
B|Oh, boy.|ba|3294
B|Well, I, I do wish that it would stop on my end because it, it seems to happen at the worst possible moments.|sd|3294
A|Yeah.|b|3294
B|And I, I guess the next one is, is door-to-door solicitors.|sd|3294
A|Uh-huh.|b|3294
B|I don't mind the children when they're selling things for school.|sd|3294
B|I have kids|sd|3294
B|and, you know, that's just kind of part of it|sv|3294
A|Yeah|b|3294
B|but when it's adults selling a variety of things and especially when men arrive at about ten o'clock in the morning uh, that really, it makes you not feel particularly safe|sv|3294
A|Uh-huh.|b|3294
A|Yes.|b|3294
B|and, it's annoying as well.|sv|3294
A|And these, and these people may in fact be just looking to find an unoccupied house to rob.|sv|3294
B|Right,|aa|3294
B|you just, you really don't know,|sv|3294
B|so I, I find myself being a a bit abrupt and a little bit ruder than than I might normally be|sd|3294
A|Uh-huh.|b|3294
B|but, I do feel like it's a, an invasion of my space.|sd|3294
A|Yeah.|b|3294
B|And, uh,|%|3294
B|I've never quite understood the purpose of that.|sd|3294
B|Yeah,|%|3294
B|I, uh,|%|3294
A|Well, I think these people were hired by, from, from different sources.|sd|3294
B|Just|%|3294
A|Uh, with, you know,|%|3294
A|and so, therefore, there's no one answer.|sv|3294
A|But, but, yeah|%|3294
A|sometimes it's a market basically it's a market survey|sd|3294
B|Just a survey.|sd|3294
A|but they never say who, who they're really working for or what you know, what what, what questions are, you know,|sv|3294
B|Yeah.|b|3294
B|There have been a couple of times when the, the, uh, whatever the subject was, I guess caught my interest and I went along with it|sd|3294
B|and then there have been several times when I just said, well, I just really don't have the time, you know to deal with it at that moment.|sd|3294
A|Yeah|b|3294
A|Yeah.|b|3294
B|But, uh, I don't get too many of those.|sd|3294
A|Yeah|b|3294
B|I've had just a few.|sd|3294
A|Yeah|b|3294
B|Uh, generally someone's trying to sell me something|sd|3294
B|or,|%|3294
A|Right,|b|3294
A|well, and sometimes that's, this is just the lead in to a sales pitch too.|sd|3294
B|Right,|aa|3294
B|right.|aa|3294
A|Other times it's, you know, wasting your time to collect the data they want for their marketing purpose.|sv|3294
B|Right.|aa|3294
A|For which, if they would just pay me enough money I would be willing to consider.|sd|3294
B|Yeah.|b|3294
B|That's right.|aa|3294
A|But, but a dollar isn't it,|sv|3294
A|you know, it's,|%|3294
B|Oh.|b|3294
A|Uh, and I also sort of worry that, you know, that sometimes people giveaway personal information.|sd|3294
A|Uh, when, when the call comes and, and they, uh, you know, sort of seductive, to, you know,|sd|3294
A|somebody is asking me my opinion on all of these things,|sd|3294
A|and so I start answering|sd|3294
A|and then you, you know, you go down a path|sv|3294
B|Right.|b|3294
A|uh, and you don't know where it's going to end. In fact, you don't even know what you've eventually, you know, the totality of what you've revealed *sv This isn't, you know, most likely not to, going to be used against you,|sv|3294
B|Yeah.|b|3294
B|Well, we,|%|3294
B|That's true.|aa|3294
A|but it could|sv|3294
A|and, And that seems to be something that should, should really be outlawed. Because it's subject to abuse|sv|3294
B|Yeah,|aa|3294
B|you just never know, I guess.|sv|3294
B|That,|%|3294
B|yeah,|%|3294
B|I, I,|%|3294
A|and it,|%|3294
B|Asking for information is, is,|%|3294
B|I can't really see that,|sd|3294
B|I think they ought to, if, if nothing else, they ought to spend money for a postage stamp|sv|3294
B|and, you know, when it arrives at your house, oh, I,|%|3294
