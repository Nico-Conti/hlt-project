B|Okay,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|2616
B|so I think, I think what we should talk about is, uh, the war.|sv|2616
A|Okay.|b|2616
B|The war that just went on.|sd|2616
B|See, I, I don't agree with it.|sv|2616
B|First of all I don't believe in war.|sv|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|And then, the United States has this attitude by saying, you know, thank you for keeping us our freedom and stuff like that.|sv|2616
B|And I think it's all independent because, it's, it has nothing to do with the United States.|sv|2616
B|You didn't gain anything from it.|sv|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|And it wasn't our freedom that you were saving.|sv|2616
B|It was just,|%|2616
B|the thing, the thing that, that, that I saw was okay,|sd|2616
B|Iraq wants to raise oil prices.|sd|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|Kuwait wants to take Iraq out of the whole system,  by leaving them independent.|sd|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|And so, when Iraq, you know, saw this, they said let's take over the country, which is a good idea,|sd|2616
B|right?|^g|2616
A|Uh-huh.|ny|2616
B|Then the United States says, okay, our, our oil prices are going to go up.|sd|2616
B|And like for example, see, okay, like Lithuania right, they declared themselves an independent country with a president,|sd|2616
B|right.|^g|2616
A|Uh-huh.|ny|2616
B|Russia goes in there, well the main government in Moscow goes in there|sd|2616
B|and they kick everybody's ass.|sd|2616
B|And the United States doesn't go in there|sd|2616
B|and say, listen, they were, you know, named an independent, you know, state with a president and everything|sd|2616
B|but we're not going to go into your country.|^q|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|But these countries here, which, you know, are, you know, like in NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR,|sv|2616
B|have you ever read that book?|qy|2616
A|No,|nn|2616
A|huh-uh.|nn|2616
B|Okay,|bk|2616
B|NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR there are like three big continents|sd|2616
B|and, uh, there's just this area, like around Egypt and stuff,  that everybody's fighting over.|sd|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|Now the problem is, is that nobody's going to invade anybody else's boundaries.|sv|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|Right,|b|2616
B|like their immediate boundaries. Like you're not going to go, you know, it's like the Army's not going to go straight into Russia because there you're, you're invading their border,|sd|2616
B|right.|^g|2616
A|Uh-huh.|ny|2616
B|But all the other countries, you can fight about.|sd|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|And so the thing is, is that you're wasting so much money to send, you know,|sv|2616
B|it's like how much money did the U S spend when they could have paid so much money for each barrel of oil that was being,|qh|2616
A|We'll probably never know how much it actually cost.|sv|2616
B|And you know, it's, it was basically all based on oil because nobody|sv|2616
B|actually, like for example, if, uh, let's say if, you know Brazil took over you know, Surinam.  I don't think anybody would care.|sv|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
A|Yeah.|b|2616
B|You know, and, uh, that's something that, that has been, you know, very,|sv|2616
B|because, see the thing is, is like every time that I see a war, I see myself on the front line, and on the other side I see myself again, and I've got to shoot myself, you know.|sd|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|I got to shoot somebody that's got the same family that I do. You know, the same relationships that I do.|sd|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|And just because I was born here I've got to shoot them down.|sd|2616
A|Uh-huh,|b|2616
A|oh, it's never a pleasant thing,|sv|2616
A|that's true.|aa|2616
B|And, uh, but at least it was, it was over quick|sd|2616
B|and there weren't that many deaths.|sd|2616
A|Yes|aa|2616
A|that's,|%|2616
B|Now the only problem is, is the aftermath,  that you're having so many deaths in the border with, uh, Turkey.|sv|2616
A|Yes.|aa|2616
A|Yes,|aa|2616
A|that's really unfortunate,|sv|2616
A|it really is.|sv|2616
A|I don't know if we stopped too soon,|sd|2616
A|I don't, I don't, I really don't know what we need to do about that.|sd|2616
B|Well, there's something that, that the U S did right which is say, say, you know, okay,|sd|2616
B|let's kick him out of Kuwait, which was our basic goal.|^q|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|And, uh, now, indirectly let's try to overthrow him, you know.|^q|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|And they're not going to do that directly.|sd|2616
B|But the thing is, is that, they, they didn't go into, into Iraq and say, you know, because they have the force to go in there and say get out of the country.|sd|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|You know, you can seek, seek asylum here,|^q|2616
A|Yeah.|b|2616
B|and you can go there,|^q|2616
B|but no way are you going to rule ever again.|^q|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
A|I've been hearing some talk too of trying to bring Hussein up on, you know, criminal charges.|sd|2616
A|I don't know if that will ever happen or not.|h|2616
B|Well the thing is, is that first of all they got to, they they have to get him.|sv|2616
A|Uh-huh,|b|2616
A|which is very difficult to do.|sv|2616
B|And, and there's no way that you can get them, unless it's by force.|sv|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|You know. And then you can put him on trial.|sd|2616
A|Obviously, he's not going to turn himself in.|sv|2616
B|No,|aa|2616
B|no,|aa|2616
B|I think, I think he'd rather commit suicide than turn himself in, because there's, I mean there's like, it's like there's no hope, you know, like what Hitler did, you know.|sv|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|You know, like if you were going to put on trial you get to live the rest of your life, but where.|sd|2616
A|True,|aa|2616
A|yeah,|%|2616
A|uh-huh.|%|2616
B|You know, and so, um, the thing is, is that once you've done something wrong, which is  you know, internationally recognized, then you're going to try to get out of it|sv|2616
B|and the, there's no way, you know. And especially since he's got inside Iraq for using, you know, chemical weapons and stuff.|sv|2616
A|Yeah,|aa|2616
A|true.|aa|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|And you know like he sent planes over to, to shoot the people down that were on the border with, uh, that were on their way to Turkey.|sd|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|He had a couple of them bombarded.|sd|2616
A|Yeah,|b|2616
A|yeah,|b|2616
A|obviously human life means nothing to him.|sv|2616
B|Huh-uh.|b|2616
B|But, uh, you know, he's got, uh, millions of dollars,|sd|2616
B|like,  I think it was like, I don't know if it was fifty billion or fifty million, which is really, doesn't make any difference|sv|2616
A|Oh yeah.|b|2616
A|That's true.|aa|2616
A|Past a point it doesn't make any difference.|bf|2616
B|Yeah.|aa|2616
A|Yeah,|b|2616
A|that's really, really unfortunate.|sv|2616
A|It really is.|sv|2616
B|But it's just, it's just that, uh, you know, you know, like the,|%|2616
B|we just put our goals in different, you know, levels is|sv|2616
B|like saying, you know, it's like|%|2616
B|yeah,|sv|2616
B|sure,|sv|2616
B|we need oil, you know,|sd|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|and we need it desperately.|sd|2616
A|Yeah.|b|2616
B|But the other countries, that, you know, that have oil but not as big, you know, like they say, you know, like when the prices went up and then they went down.|sd|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|When they took that big dip it was because they discovered another big oil well somewhere in Saudi Arabia,  or something.|sd|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
A|Seems like the prices never go down to where they were originally, though, before, before the increase started.|sv|2616
B|Well, it, its an advantage.|sv|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|You know, it's like you're saying, okay, I can bring my prices up to a dollar fifty a gallon and I'm not going to bring them back down to, you know, ninety-nine cents.|sv|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|Why,|qh|2616
B|because people are willing to pay a dollar fifty a gallon,|sv|2616
B|so if I leave it at a dollar ten, people are still going to pay.|sv|2616
A|True.|aa|2616
B|You know, I went down forty cents,|sd|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|but I went up ten cents.|sv|2616
A|Yeah.|b|2616
B|Yeah.|b^m|2616
A|About the lowest I've seen gasoline in the Dallas area is, uh, I guess, about ninety-two point nine now.|sd|2616
B|Ninety-eight?|br|2616
A|Ninety-two.|sd|2616
B|Oh, God.|ba|2616
B|Here it's like, it's like a dollar five.|sd|2616
A|Oh really.|b|2616
B|Yeah.|b|2616
A|Well there's still a lot of dollar five places here|sd|2616
A|but you can find some that's under a dollar, but not, not a whole lot.|sd|2616
A|That's the lowest I've seen.|sd|2616
B|But still the,|%|2616
B|I mean, have you ever checked, like, uh, the most money-makers in, uh, in nineteen, uh, ninety.|qy|2616
B|Uh, you can see that, uh,  Exxon and Amaco and uh, other companies, oh God, I forgot their names, but, uh, Exxon was the number one money-maker,|sd|2616
A|Uh-huh.|ny|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|and that was just because of, of the last quarter.|sd|2616
A|Right,|b|2616
A|I think Mobil was doing very well, too.|sd|2616
B|Yeah.|b|2616
A|Well I, I assume all the major, major brands are.|sd|2616
B|And, uh, that was,|%|2616
B|I mean and what other companies are, went up four hundred and some percent.|sd|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|And that's practically impossible to do now a days, for a company to,  to shoot up in that way.|sv|2616
A|That's true.|aa|2616
A|Yeah,|aa|2616
A|yeah,|aa|2616
A|that's true.|sv|2616
B|And, uh, it's just that, you know, people, people take advantage of that.|sv|2616
B|You know, like the, the companies are saying we're trying not to raise our prices but when, you know, when we get a barrel coming in at more than what we're selling it for, we've got to raise our prices.|sd|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|You know, but still if you realize that, uh, one barrel has like, how much was it, like, um forty gallons,|sd|2616
A|Yeah,|aa|2616
A|something like,|h|2616
A|yeah.|%|2616
B|it's got forty gallons|sd|2616
B|and they're selling, you know, you know,|sd|2616
B|you got to pay forty dollars at least and,  you know, for, uh, for one gallon|sd|2616
A|Yeah.|b|2616
B|and it's, it was selling like at twenty-five or something.|sd|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|So you're making, uh, you know, fifteen dollars profit, easily.|sd|2616
A|Yeah,|b|2616
A|yeah,|b|2616
A|sure.|b|2616
B|And, uh, everything,|%|2616
B|I mean, and, and, the expenses, you know, of the war, you know, it's like, uh, it's like who's gaining on this.|sv|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|Okay,|b|2616
B|because, uh, does, does the U S government own any gas companies, like, like, you know gas stations and stuff?|qh|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|I, because, see like for example, I don't know if the British government owns Shell.|sd|2616
B|I'm not sure about that.|sd|2616
A|I'm not sure either.|sd|2616
B|But the thing is like the U S government got nothing out of it. Because, well, you know, it's like the other independent companies, the gas stations, you know, they did.|sv|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|And, uh, then the taxes go up|sd|2616
B|and then everybody else loses.|sd|2616
A|Uh-huh.|b|2616
B|But, um, you know, they're just, they're just some things that might not be worth it.|sv|2616
A|Yeah,|aa|2616
A|that's true.|sv|2616
B|You know, and, and first of all how many, how many people had to, had to die before the war, you know,|qh|2616
B|it's like transporting stuff and things like that,  before, you know, it's like|sd|2616
A|Uh-huh,|b|2616
A|yeah.|b|2616
B|yeah|%|2616
B|sure, you know, like to, to a couple people that died there, their families don't feel it was necessary to do that.|sv|2616
A|Sure,|aa|2616
A|dead's dead.|bf|2616
B|Yeah,|aa|2616
B|yeah,|aa|2616
B|you, you could, you could never bring them back.|sd|2616
A|That's true,|aa|2616
A|so.|%|2616
B|Oh well.|b|2616
A|Well, I don't guess we resolved anything|sv|2616
A|but it's interesting.|sv|2616
B|Yeah,|b|2616
B|so, okay,|%|2616
B|nice talking to you.|fc|2616
A|To you too,|fc|2616
A|take care.|fc|2616
B|Bye-bye.|fc|2616
A|Bye-bye.|fc|2616
