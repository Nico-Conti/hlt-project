A|All right, Carolyn,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3282
A|When do you,|qw|3282
A|are you reading the papers about the, the Middle East summit?|qy|3282
B|Uh, some.|na|3282
A|Yes.|aa|3282
A|I'm just a little bit too.|sd|3282
A|I think, um, I think I was worn worn out from Middle East after the war.|sd|3282
B|Yeah.|b|3282
B|I think it kind of, uh, it didn't really take over the first page quite as much as it did I think during the war.|sd|3282
A|Uh-huh.|b|3282
B|But, um, we definitely need something there with all the hostages and what all.|sv|3282
A|Yeah,|b|3282
A|yeah.|b|3282
A|That's I think, uh,|%|3282
A|I don't know in the short run it would be really nice to get the hostages all back.|sv|3282
B|Uh-huh.|b|3282
A|I think that's really, uh, really important.|sv|3282
B|Yeah.|b|3282
A|But I think they just have a whole different world than we do|sv|3282
A|so, I don't know.|h|3282
A|But I don't know what do you think some of the long term repercussions might be?|qo|3282
B|Oh, well, you know, I just see this Middle East situation with, with Russia and everything there that's happened I think that that crisis has kind of slowed down,|sv|3282
B|and I see the Middle East as being, you know the real hot spot of the future so to speak.|sd|3282
A|Uh-huh.|b|3282
A|Yeah.|b|3282
B|So, I guess I view it as being the prime importance as far as trying to negotiate, trying to wind down some of the tensions and everything that are there.|sv|3282
A|Uh-huh.|b|3282
A|Yeah,|b|3282
A|I think, um,|%|3282
A|I don't know I have, uh, I just have this, this civil rights mentality I, I guess.|sd|3282
A|You know should we|qh|3282
A|or, or you know, should we, uh,|%|3282
A|those, I wish those countries could have the same type of freedoms or whatever that we do.|sv|3282
B|Uh-huh.|b|3282
A|I guess that's what I, I hope for them.|sd|3282
A|But some of them don't want those freedoms I think.|sv|3282
A|Their, their religious beliefs may, um, may not, you know,|sv|3282
A|they may not want it as a whole|sv|3282
A|so I think that's something that has to be considered too.|sv|3282
B|Yeah.|b|3282
A|But I think that's a, that's really a long term type thing.|sv|3282
A|I know that the, the,|%|3282
A|it said think about long term repercussions|sd|3282
A|and I was just thinking, well, peace is peace you know,|sd|3282
B|Uh-huh.|b|3282
A|and that really is the nicest thing.|sd|3282
B|I guess the question in my mind somewhat|sd|3282
B|and, and it depends on the country, you know,|sv|3282
B|I think some are more peaceful than others.|sv|3282
A|Uh-huh,|b|3282
A|yeah.|b|3282
B|If you look at, um, Iraq for example and you know the recent thing with the U N going in there and the, the bomb development and all this kind of stuff, you know.|sv|3282
A|Yeah.|b|3282
A|Uh-huh.|b|3282
B|Gosh.|ba|3282
B|I think, you know, we should have got him while we could or whatever.|sv|3282
A|Yeah.|aa|3282
A|Yeah.|aa|3282
A|I, I think so.|aa|3282
A|I think, um,|%|3282
B|And I think there's a certain mentality to that that's in the Middle East, you know, the, the constant fighting, you know|sv|3282
A|And,|%|3282
B|and,|%|3282
A|Right.|b|3282
A|I think, I think they realized we would probably never push him out|sv|3282
A|and, uh, I think the other,|%|3282
A|probably all of the other Arab countries said that we were sort of wimpy for not forcing him out.|sv|3282
B|Yeah,|b|3282
B|I think they, they look at force as a way of you know, their, their means to their ends.|sv|3282
A|Uh-huh.|b|3282
A|Yeah,|b|3282
A|yep.|b|3282
B|And, uh, so I, you know, I don't know so much if these peace talks are going to,|sv|3282
B|I don't know how much they'll stay to them.|sv|3282
A|Uh-huh.|b|3282
B|You know, if, if we, even if we say that we're going to do stuff, I don't know how they'll stick to that|sv|3282
A|Yeah.|b|3282
A|I, I think the, the thing is though I, I guess the, the Arab countries that used to argue with us or not support any ideas that, that coincide with the, the U S ideas or whatever used to probably receive money from the Soviet Union.|sv|3282
B|Uh-huh.|b|3282
A|And I guess that's all gone.|sv|3282
A|I think that's really, uh, probably what started the whole process.|sv|3282
B|Uh-huh.|b|3282
A|I,|%|3282
B|Well, that's probably a bonus on our part.|sv|3282
A|Yeah.|b|3282
B|Yes,|aa|3282
B|it is.|sv|3282
A|I think, I think that they're they're so much more vulnerable now because they don't receive support from the Soviet Union|sv|3282
B|Uh-huh.|b|3282
A|so I guess they're saying, well, you know, we can eat two ways or we can get this aid free from these countries two ways.|sd|3282
A|We can either act like we're going to be pro-communist or act like we're going to be pro, uh, pro-democracy|^q|3282
A|and whatever gets us the most honor that's what we'll act like we're going to do,|^q|3282
A|but we really won't change in the long run.|^q|3282
B|Yeah.|b|3282
A|I think that's the way I sort of see them all working, you know.|sv|3282
B|I tend to agree with you.|aa|3282
A|Yeah.|b|3282
B|You know, I think they have in mind what they want to do|sv|3282
B|and I think a lot of times their might make right .|sv|3282
A|Uh-huh.|b|3282
B|And, you know it,|%|3282
B|kind of the forceful, you know,|sv|3282
B|I don't know.|h|3282
B|But I just don't think peace is uppermost in their minds|sv|3282
A|Yeah.|b|3282
A|It's, it's really funny as an American and always being an ally with the Israelis.|sd|3282
A|I always find it very hard in my heart to to align with the Israelis because they seem to be just as bad as the Arabs, you know.|sv|3282
B|Uh-huh.|b|3282
A|But then again they have to live in that environment.|sv|3282
A|They have to be subjected to all of the Arab bombings, and terrorist attacks and whatever.|sd|3282
B|Yeah.|b|3282
A|Then they have to negotiate almost everything|sv|3282
A|and then you think to yourself, well, you know in your heart you don't want to be aligned with somebody that's mean and cruel to someone else,|sv|3282
A|but if that's the environment that they have to live in and survive in, then you have to sort of|sv|3282
A|like, I don't know,|h|3282
A|logically,|%|3282
