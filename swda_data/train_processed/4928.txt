A|Well my exercise program consists of, uh, you know,|sd|4928
A|it's, it's a opportunity to stay alive really. Instead of, you know, wasting my, my, the, you know, the, trying to exist on the latency of my youth, the good health of my youth.|sd|4928
B|Huh.|%|4928
A|I'm,|%|4928
A|and what I like to do is I like to stretch out|sd|4928
A|and I like to run, uh,|sd|4928
A|I'm, I like to run, get my heartbeat up.|sd|4928
A|I like to run about, oh, about two, two and a half miles.|sd|4928
A|And then I like to work out on, uh, on the, uh, the Bailey Life Cycle machines up here at the, at the Holiday Spa.|sd|4928
A|And, and I, I think that, you know,|%|4928
A|I've had a regiment now for about, you know, ten, fifteen years of, of doing that|sd|4928
A|and, uh, and I, I kind of think it's, uh, it's a lot of work|sd|4928
A|but I think it's, uh, it's a lot of work|sd|4928
A|but I think it's, uh, it's the, uh, the amount of effort that's required to, uh, to stay healthy, you know.|sd|4928
A|I have a sedentary job|sd|4928
A|and, uh, unless you do something like that, you're going to get sick.|sv|4928
B|Right.|aa|4928
B|Yeah,|aa|4928
B|I'm, I need to get,|sd|4928
B|I'm, I'm pretty bad about that.|sd|4928
B|I'm lazy.|sd|4928
B|I should, I know|sd|4928
B|I want, I always say that I need to get start running|sd|4928
B|and I'm going to try and do that this summer.|sd|4928
B|Because I never have time.|sd|4928
B|I, I always put it off.|sd|4928
B|By the time I get back from classes it's late at night|sd|4928
B|and I don't feel like going back over to the gym and running on the track or whatever.|sd|4928
B|Because I'm, I'm getting a gut here.|sd|4928
B|I got to get back into shape.|sd|4928
A|Well, I, uh, two years ago I started having trouble with my knee.|sd|4928
A|And, uh, you know, I've got, you know,|%|4928
A|I figured well, it'll go away.|sd|4928
A|Well I you know, I'm, I've had to reduce my program, reduce my program|sd|4928
A|and I've gained fifteen pounds.|sd|4928
B|Huh.|%|4928
A|And so, uh, you know, it's, you know,|%|4928
A|I need to get back into swimming, you know, instead of running.|sd|4928
A|If I can't swim or I can't run, I should be able to swim.|sd|4928
A|Well I'm such a terrible swimmer|sd|4928
A|and I, I, I really feel I can, I can dedicate about an hour, an hour and fifteen minutes to this effort.|sd|4928
A|But if it gets longer than that I, I, it, I start not doing anything.|sd|4928
B|Yeah.|b|4928
A|And so, so I got a real problem in that regard.|sd|4928
A|Uh, it,|%|4928
A|do,|%|4928
A|you obviously are, are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it.|sv|4928
B|Yeah.|aa|4928
B|I mean, I do it, I guess,|sd|4928
B|I'm going to do it, uh, because I want to get in shape.|sd|4928
B|I'm not, it's not something I really enjoy all that much that, I'll, I'll probably,|sd|4928
B|I mean once I get into it and I, if I, if I get into better shape then it'll be, it won't be as much of a, a chore to me.|sd|4928
A|Well, it's, it's always a chore.|sv|4928
A|I mean  I started doing this when I was about thirty-five|sd|4928
B|Yeah.|b|4928
B|Huh.|%|4928
A|and now I'm fifty-five.|sd|4928
B|Yeah.|b|4928
A|And, uh, you know, I, I know that in, I just know that I'm going to get blown away with some, some piece of nonsense.|sd|4928
A|you know, some health related thing is going to blow me away.|sd|4928
A|That's the same way,|sd|4928
A|I got too much weight on right now.|sd|4928
A|I  need to lose fifty pounds, you know.|sd|4928
B|Right.|b|4928
A|I need to lose at least twenty, you know.|sd|4928
A|But, uh, you know, it's, it's just, uh, I'm busy.|sd|4928
A|I'm doing a lot of traveling|sd|4928
A|and, uh, it, it creates a problem, uh, you know, when you're on the road.|sd|4928
A|What sort of, uh, uh, what other programs other than say running?|qw|4928
A|Have you, have you ever done anything at all?|qy|4928
B|Yeah,|ny|4928
B|I have.|sd|4928
B|Uh, sit-ups|sd|4928
B|or, also last summer I was doing Nautilus|sd|4928
B|or last year I'm, uh, belong to a club right here.|sd|4928
A|Uh-huh.|b|4928
B|That was a little bit too much money.|sd|4928
B|But, uh, doing a mix of Nautilus and free weights. I like that.|sd|4928
A|club, what club are you with?|qw|4928
B|I'm sorry?|br|4928
A|What club were you with?|qw|4928
B|It's called, oh, what was it called City Sports, downtown Washington.|sd|4928
A|Oh. Okay.|bk|4928

B|Yeah.|aa|4928
B|It's , uh, Plaza.|sd|4928
A|Oh.|b|4928
A|Well, I'd, uh,|%|4928
A|well there's a, there's a Holiday Spa down there on, on K street, I think. Something like that.|sd|4928
A|But, uh, I, I go to the Holiday Spa here in Alexandria|sd|4928
A|and that's pretty good.|sd|4928
A|But, you know, evening time it gets pretty busy.|sd|4928
A|But generally, you know, I can, I can get in and get a program, you know.|sd|4928
B|Right.|b|4928
A|But, uh, you know, I, I need to, I need to rededicate myself to, uh, to doing this|sd|4928
A|and, uh, I got a problem, uh, you know, ever since my knee went bad, of getting back solidly into it.|sd|4928
A|I mean, I've been doing this for fifteen, twenty years.|sd|4928
B|Yeah.|b|4928
A|And, you know, and I'm, I know I'm going to get, I know it's going to bite me in the ass|sd|4928
A|and so I, I really don't want to, want to, uh, you know, back off on it.|sd|4928
B|Yeah.|aa|4928
B|It's something,|sv|4928
B|I think, uh, I'm young,|sd|4928
B|I should get started getting into shape.|sd|4928
B|I don't want to,|sd|4928
B|I want,|%|4928
B|I mean at one point it's going to be too late to do it. .|sv|4928
A|Well, no.|ar|4928
A|When you're young, you, you can abuse your, your, all your systems|sv|4928
A|and you can recover.|sv|4928
B|Yeah.|b|4928
A|Uh, when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems, you get blown away. And just wind up having to kiss your ass good-bye, you know.|sv|4928
B|Huh|%|4928
A|And, uh, and so the object,|sv|4928
