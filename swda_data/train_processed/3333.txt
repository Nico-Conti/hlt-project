A|All right.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3333
A|I've never done it before,|sd|3333
A|so I guess that's all I have to do, right|qy|3333
B|I guess so.|no|3333
A|I've been called several times,|sd|3333
A|and I push in, pushed in my number,|sd|3333
A|they kept saying you have the invalid code|sd|3333
B|Oh, really.|b|3333
A|and then I found out that my new phone wasn't working right.|sd|3333
B|Oh|b|3333
A|Oh, so this is the first time I've even done it.|sd|3333
B|Yeah.|b|3333
A|I wonder how long it's going to be on for.|qw|3333
B|I think five minutes is the max.|sd|3333
A|Oh, no,|ba|3333
A|I mean, this whole thing, like for two months or something,|sd|3333
A|do you know?|qy|3333
B|Oh, I don't know.|no|3333
A|Yeah,|b|3333
A|okay,|%|3333
A|well back to crime,|sd|3333
A|I guess we're supposed to talk about that.|sv|3333
A|They say what aspect are you worried about,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3333
A|well, I think at this point, I for one am worried about every aspect|sd|3333
B|Right,|aa|3333
B|especially, uh, you, since you're in the same metroplex,|sd|3333
B|you know, there's so much going on here.|sv|3333
A|I think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common, that's really a, something you got to protect yourself from.|sd|3333
B|Well, that, and in the schools, too starting to put metal detectors in,|sv|3333
A|Uh-huh,|b|3333
A|golly|ba|3333
A|I know.|aa|3333
B|and,|%|3333
A|Have they done that in Garland?|qy|3333
B|No,|nn|3333
B|I,|%|3333
B|not that I'm aware of.|sd|3333
A|Now, um,|%|3333
B|I just heard, you know, last week at that one school, they started putting them in because there was that one shooting|sd|3333
A|Right.|b|3333
B|so, um,|%|3333
A|Well, we had a vice principal shot at here last year on the, you know, on the school grounds after school.|sd|3333
B|Is that right?|bh|3333
A|And the one boy killed himself a few years ago, in the, in a grade school,|sd|3333
A|so you know, these kids don't have any trouble getting a hold of guns in any in any neighborhood, doesn't seem like.|sv|3333
B|Uh-huh. Yeah,|b|3333
B|yeah.|b|3333
A|So. Yeah,|b|3333
A|it's kind of scary to think, you send your child to school|sd|3333
A|and you wonder if he's going to get shot.|sd|3333
A|I mean, we didn't have to worry about that before.|sd|3333
B|I know|aa|3333
A|What next?|qh|3333
B|I know,|aa|3333
B|it's, it's, it's getting,|sv|3333
B|it's been out of hand, I think, for a while,|sv|3333
B|and it just continues to get worse.|sv|3333
A|Right,|aa|3333
A|and, you know, we can't really depend on the police to solve all this,|sv|3333
A|they just can't do it.|sv|3333
B|Yeah.|b|3333
A|I think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family to a certain extent|sv|3333
B|Right.|b|3333
A|and, uh, and how we going to bring that back together.|sv|3333
B|Yeah,|aa|3333
B|that's,|%|3333
B|I|%|3333
B|I agree,|aa|3333
B|I think that's where it stems from, is that and, um, you know, you've got a lot of, a lot more women that are working nowadays that aren't home with the children|sv|3333
A|Uh-huh.|b|3333
A|Right|b|3333
A|and,|%|3333
B|and that may impact it as well.|sv|3333
A|I think so,|aa|3333
A|and, and then there's a drop in, uh, the training of morals, really, you know.|sv|3333
B|Right,|aa|3333
B|right.|aa|3333
A|These, some of these young kids you read about, just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all|sv|3333
B|Yeah|aa|3333
A|I think I think years past maybe our criminals had a little more morals, you know wouldn't kill somebody in cold blood.|sv|3333
B|they don't think twice about it.|sv|3333
B|Yeah.|b|3333
B|Either that or I don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now, or what the, what the,|h|3333
A|I think it was just rare,|sv|3333
A|I really do.|sv|3333
B|Uh-huh.|b|3333
A|My mother, well, she's like seventy-four now.|sd|3333
A|She, when she was a young girl, she had a beautiful, beautiful cousin that lived in California,|sd|3333
A|and she was dating this millionaire's son|sd|3333
A|and he wanted to marry her,|sd|3333
A|and she wouldn't marry him|sd|3333
A|and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both,|sd|3333
A|and, uh,|%|3333
B|You're kidding.|ba|3333
A|No,|aa|3333
A|I'm the one,|%|3333
B|Himself and her?|qy|3333
A|Yeah,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3333
A|that must have been at least fifty years ago or more,|sd|3333
A|but the point of the story is that, that was so unbelievable a thing in those days that it was in all the papers, all over the country for weeks|sd|3333
B|Oh, wow,|ba|3333
B|I bet.|ba|3333
A|but now, you know, you wouldn't probably read about it here in Texas|sv|3333
B|Oh, I know,|aa|3333
A|it's just, you know, another killing.|sv|3333
B|Well, they were,|%|3333
B|I was watching some show the other day,|sd|3333
B|and they were talking about, uh, mass murderers|sd|3333
A|Uh-huh.|b|3333
B|and they brought up what happened in Killeen here recently,|sd|3333
B|and they were saying, you know, that these guys want attention, and that when it happens they're glorified because all the newspaper, it's on all the newspapers and T V and everything,|sd|3333
A|Um.|b|3333
A|Uh-huh.|b|3333
A|Uh-huh.|b|3333
A|Right,|aa|3333
A|lots of their picture and life story and everything.|sd|3333
B|Right,|aa|3333
B|and then you get to their life story,|sd|3333
B|Oh, they came from a broken family|sd|3333
A|Uh-huh.|b|3333
B|oh this person had mental problems|sd|3333
A|Right.|b|3333
B|oh duh, duh, duh you know,|^q|3333
A|Right.|b|3333
A|I know, how we and straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible,|qh|3333
B|Yeah.|b|3333
A|So, uh, that story I just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin, well, the same thing happened here in Arlington, when was it, I think it was, oh, it was almost a year ago in December to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with.|sd|3333
B|Is that right?|bh|3333
A|Yeah,|ny|3333
A|I think it was on a Hard Copy,|sd|3333
A|she was a real attractive blond girl, in, in her freshman year of college|sd|3333
B|Uh-huh.|b|3333
A|and some boy she tried to get rid of, he was like in his twenties,|sd|3333
B|Uh, I remember seeing that,|sd|3333
A|Remember that?|qy|3333
B|I saw that on Hard Copy|na|3333
A|Right,|aa|3333

A|that's, uh,|%|3333
B|Yes.|aa|3333

B|Is that right?|bh|3333
A|Yeah,|ny|3333
A|can you believe it,|qh|3333
A|that's just, uh,|%|3333
B|I'm trying to remember,|^h|3333
B|he, um, had her in the car in front of a Taco or something|sd|3333
A|Taco Bueno,|sd|3333
A|right,|aa|3333
A|uh-huh.|b|3333
B|and he just shot them himself and her.|sd|3333
A|Uh-huh.|b|3333
A|Right.|aa|3333
B|I remember seeing that.|sd|3333
A|Yeah, uh, uh,|b|3333
A|isn't that weird?|qy|3333
B|Yeah,|ny|3333
B|there's just too many crazy people out there these days.|sv|3333
A|I know,|aa|3333
A|and, uh, the police are not going to do anything until they, they've committed some sort of a crime.|sv|3333
A|You know, he was just begging her on the phone,|sv|3333
A|that's not doing anything.|sv|3333
B|Yeah.|b|3333
