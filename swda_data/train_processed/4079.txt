A|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|4079
A|So Frank, what, uh, type of, uh, budget do you or your family have?|qw|4079
B|Well, uh I don't know that we really have a budget.|sd|4079
B|I have a set amount that I, that I save.|sd|4079
B|Actually, well actually there is a, a way,|sd|4079
B|budget our money apparently.|sd|4079
B|The,|%|4079
B|uh, my wife, uh, has so much, uh, gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks|sd|4079
B|and, uh, we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff, gas, and things like that|sd|4079
B|and besides that I, uh, you know, I have a set amount that I save every month.|sd|4079
A|Right.|b|4079
A|That's, uh, sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what I have|sv|4079
B|Uh-huh.|b|4079
A|I am single,|sd|4079
A|so. I guess, I don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget,|sd|4079
B|Uh-huh.|b|4079
A|but I basically,|%|4079
B|Really don't need to.|^2|4079
A|Right,|aa|4079
A|I don't need to.|b^m|4079
A|I am the only that I have to keep track of|sd|4079
A|so it makes it a little bit easier.|sd|4079
B|That's right.|aa|4079
A|Uh, and also I, you know, I try to save a certain amount each month as well|sd|4079
B|Uh-huh.|b|4079
A|and, uh, I try to, try to have an idea of what my expenses are|sd|4079
A|and I am pretty consistent from month to month|sd|4079
B|Uh-huh.|b|4079
A|and, uh, whenever, uh, I need to, uh, whenever that changes I am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it.|sd|4079
B|Right.|b|4079
B|Well, I found that, uh, you know, things, as I have gotten older,|sd|4079
B|I am in my fifties now,|sd|4079
B|but before we use to have, to have to have a very strict budget,|sd|4079
B|I had four kids|sd|4079
B|and, uh, you know we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for, for this and for that.|sd|4079
B|Kind of anticipate how much things were going to be.|sd|4079
B|Uh, I guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting I do now is that I set aside, uh, I kind of fence off areas of my check book.|sd|4079
B|For instance, there are certain things that I know come up, uh, every so often.|sd|4079
B|Every six months I have to pay car insurance.|sd|4079
B|Uh, every six months I have to pay my taxes.|sd|4079
B|So I take a set amount.|sd|4079
A|Uh-huh.|b|4079
B|I've got a money market account that I do a lot of uh, uh, saving in|sd|4079
B|and I also have got a checking account besides that,|sd|4079
B|but, what I do on my money market account, my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month. I will just take two hundred and twenty out|sd|4079
B|and I put it in parenthesis.|sd|4079
B|I take it out of the right line total and put it in parenthesis in there and let it build up.|sd|4079
A|Uh-huh.|b|4079
B|Every month I add two hundred and twenty dollars to it.|sd|4079
B|Then when the tax bill comes in I've got that much set aside.|sd|4079
A|Right.|b|4079
B|And I guess that's a way of budgeting.|sd|4079
A|Yeah.|aa|4079
A|That's,|%|4079
A|I guess I kind of do a similar thing. More, uh, medium or longer range.|sd|4079
A|I just have a maybe a targeted amount that I will save for.|sd|4079
A|Like I am,|%|4079
A|probably within a year I would like to buy a new car.|sd|4079
B|Uh-huh.|b|4079
A|So, I kind of have a, an amount in my mind|sd|4079
A|and I am making every effort to, to put a little bit away and increase the amount that I need for a down payment or whatever.|sd|4079
B|Uh-huh.|b|4079
B|Yeah.|b|4079
B|Uh, cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget. Not only for buying them, but for keeping them on the road too.|sv|4079
A|Right.|b|4079
B|Uh, you know, we've got two cars.|sd|4079
B|My wife has a car|sd|4079
B|and I like to drive pick up truck.|sd|4079
B|So, we are on a schedule where I try every, uh, three or four years to, to buy a new one.|sd|4079
B|And you know I am constantly making car payments,|sd|4079
B|but I figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway, is making car payments.|sd|4079
A|Uh-huh.|b|4079
B|So, uh, you know, I get one paid for|sd|4079
B|and, uh, actually I am saving up for another one besides|sd|4079
B|so it's you know, it's kind of a never ending thing,|sd|4079
A|Huh. Right.|b|4079
B|but you try to, you try to schedule those things so that, uh, you only, you're not paying for two of at the same time I guess is what I am saying.|sd|4079
A|Right.|b|4079
A|Have you thought about, uh, leasing?|qy|4079
B|Well, uh, I have thought about it,|na|4079
B|but leasing wouldn't,|sd|4079
B|you know, I don't use it for my business.|sd|4079
A|I see.|bk|4079
B|My wife uses hers just for pleasure|sd|4079
B|and I use mine just to go back and forth to work which is only ten miles away|sd|4079
A|Right.|b|4079
B|so.|%|4079
A|But if you are rolling it over every three years, it might be advantageous to do that.|sv|4079
B|Yeah,|aa|4079
B|I guess.|aa|4079
B|Uh,|%|4079
A|You know, typically, you, if you purchase your own car you tend to make, uh, the best returns after you pay it off.|sv|4079
B|Uh-huh.|b|4079
A|Of course, the longer you keep it beyond that point, the more profitable it is to own it yourself.|sv|4079
B|Right.|aa|4079
B|Yeah,|aa|4079
B|you're right.|aa|4079
B|Uh, I have, uh, been know to keep trucks or cars for oh, ten or twelve years,|sd|4079
B|but I find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill|sd|4079
B|and you got to put put stuff in them you know.|sv|4079
A|That's right.|aa|4079
A|Yeah,|%|4079
A|mine's, uh, seven years old|sd|4079
A|and I think last year was, that was a rough year for it.|sd|4079
A|I had a number of expenses|sd|4079
B|Uh-huh.|b|4079
A|But, uh, I am hoping that most of them were just kind of,|sd|4079
A|uh, you know the,|%|4079
A|as you get to a certain number of miles, you have to get everything replaced, brakes, shocks and all that.|sd|4079
A|So, I just went through that whole set last year.|sd|4079
B|Uh-huh.|b|4079
A|I hope that I only have a slow period before I do that again|sd|4079
B|Those things can really upset your budget when they, when they come in.|sv|4079
B|Uh, you know, it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the, for the unexpected shall we say. So that it doesn't, uh, kill you all in one month.|sv|4079
A|Right.|b|4079
A|Right.|b|4079
A|What line of work are you in?|qw|4079
