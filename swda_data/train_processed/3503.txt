A|Well, how do you feel about capital punishment?|qo|3503
B|Well, I, I just last Friday got off a capital murder case.|sd|3503
A|Oh, you did?|bh|3503
B|Yeah,|ny|3503
B|I was on the jury. Uh,|sd|3503
A|Wow.|ba|3503
B|Yeah|b|3503
B|Which is funny because I got called last night|sd|3503
B|and the topic was, uh, something about juries|sd|3503
A|Oh, really|bh|3503
B|Yeah,|ny|3503
B|so I am just hitting it right.|sd|3503
B|Uh, how do I feel about it?|qo|3503
B|I, I don't know.|h|3503
B|Well, I guess it is right in certain cases. Uh,|sv|3503
A|Yeah.|b|3503
B|well, the one I was just on, I don't,|sd|3503
B|I was an alternate on the case,|sd|3503
B|so I don't know what was decided.|sd|3503
A|Right.|b|3503
B|They are probably still in deliberations on it.|sd|3503
A|Uh-huh.|b|3503
B|But, uh, what I found out,|sd|3503
B|once, once I was declared an alternate and I was dismissed, we met with the judge, the two alternates did.|sd|3503
A|Right.|b|3503
B|And, uh, he went on to tell us how they happened to catch this guy|sd|3503
B|and I remember hearing about it.|sd|3503
B|It was about a year ago.|sd|3503
B|Uh, he was, he was involved in another one, another capital murder the very next month|sd|3503
B|and he was caught just,|sd|3503
B|they, they drove up,|sd|3503
B|the police drove up just as he fired the gun and killed the guy.|sd|3503
A|Oh, wow.|ba|3503
B|So he was caught|sd|3503
B|and, uh, it's interesting because the county I live in,|sd|3503
B|I'm not in Dallas county,|sd|3503
B|I'm, I'm pretty far north of Dallas.|sd|3503
A|Okay.|b|3503
B|Uh, county I live in, in the past ten years only had two capital murders.|sd|3503
A|Wow.|ba|3503
B|And last year there were six|sd|3503
B|and this guy is indicted on three of them.|sd|3503
A|Really?|bh|3503
B|Yeah,|ny|3503
B|so you have to wonder you know.|sv|3503
A|Wow|ba|3503
A|Yeah,|b|3503
A|well, the cases like that, they should,|sv|3503
B|Yeah.|b|3503
A|I mean, if he's going to be drastic, somebody has to be drastic back.|sv|3503
B|Yeah,|b|3503
B|although, you know, it's not really revenge because it doesn't mean anything to him.|sv|3503
B|You know, he, he has no concept of what he has done.|sv|3503
A|Really?|bh|3503
B|He just, well,|%|3503
B|from what I can tell. I mean, I didn't talk to the guy or anything,|sd|3503
B|but I mean, he doesn't seem to have any regard for anybody's life including his own.|sd|3503
A|Right.|b|3503
A|Wow.|ba|3503
B|So, it's, it's kind of strange that, you know,|sv|3503
A|Uh-huh.|b|3503
A|No, no remorse whatsoever, huh.|qy|3503
B|No,|nn|3503
B|huh-uh.|nn|3503
A|Well, I guess in cases like that, you know, where the guy would, obviously, go out and do it again I mean, you've got to do something.|sv|3503
B|Yeah.|b|3503
B|Yeah,|b|3503
B|well, it's funny because when, you know, they interview you before you go on the jury and for capital murder, I was interviewed by four attorneys for about five hours.|sd|3503
A|Right.|b|3503
A|Wow.|ba|3503
B|And I,|%|3503
B|the,|%|3503
B|I was the, I think the ninety eighth person they'd interviewed.|sd|3503
A|You're kidding.|ba|3503
B|But, you know at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone|sd|3503
B|and do you think you'd ever know beyond a doubt|sd|3503
B|and I said I can't imagine,|sd|3503
B|I said if I knew beyond a doubt or if I felt beyond a doubt that he had done it, yeah,|sd|3503
B|I guess I could convict him,|sd|3503
B|but I can't imagine you ever making me that sure of something.|sd|3503
A|Right.|b|3503
B|But they really did.|sd|3503
B|It was, it was really amazing.|sd|3503
A|Really?|bh|3503
A|Well, I guess if the police came out and saw him fire the gun,|sd|3503
B|Well, that was a subsequent case that we didn't know about. And those jurors don't know about.|sd|3503
A|Oh, really?|bh|3503
B|But this particular case, I mean, they had a complete confession from the guy with a lot of things that, that the police hadn't released|sd|3503
A|Okay.|b|3503
B|so no one else would have known.|sd|3503
A|Oh.|b|3503
B|It was, it was really pretty interesting.|sd|3503
A|Wow.|ba|3503
A|What,|%|3503
B|Educational.|sd|3503
A|I guess cases like that, I don't see why they wouldn't bring in the new evidence from the other case.|sd|3503
B|Well, they can't, they can, I think in the punishment phase but not in the guilt or innocence because he hasn't been, he hasn't been found guilty of it.|sd|3503
A|Okay.|b|3503
A|Of that crime|^2|3503
B|Right.|b|3503
A|but he was found guilty of|sd|3503
A|okay.|b|3503
B|Right,|b|3503
B|so you know, it's, although, it's not going to take much to prove that.|sd|3503
A|That works.|^2|3503
A|Right.|b|3503
B|So,|%|3503
A|Well, they pushing the death penalty?|qy|3503
B|Uh, yeah,|ny|3503
B|this guy is up for the death penalty.|sd|3503
A|Wow.|ba|3503
B|Uh, and in Texas there is, there is a couple of questions you have to ask, uh, in the punishment phase.|sd|3503
B|Uh, for example, was the guy provoked and was the response reasonable given the provocation|sd|3503
B|And there is a number of questions|sd|3503
B|and just depending on whether you say yes or no, uh, you, you can give him capital punishment|sd|3503
B|and if you're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment, then you can look at mitigating circumstances.|sd|3503
A|Okay.|b|3503
A|So,|%|3503
B|So there is a lot of outs,|sd|3503
B|but the only result is, otherwise he gets life in prison.|sd|3503
A|Yeah,|b|3503
A|and I'm really kind of against life in prison anyway because it costs so dog gone much.|sv|3503
B|Yeah|b|3503
B|Right,|b|3503
B|and, and to me, I mean, you take away a person's freedom, you've taken away most of their life.|sv|3503
A|That's true.|ba|3503
A|I mean, if you're going to put him in prison for life with no chance for parole,|sv|3503
B|Yeah,|b|3503
B|but,|%|3503
B|But then you have to look at reality.|sd|3503
B|I mean, I think, you know, normally they, they may get out|sv|3503
B|so,|%|3503
A|That's true.|ba|3503
B|But what is it worth?|bh|3503
B|I don't know.|sd|3503
A|Uh-huh.|b|3503
B|Personally I don't know which I would pick if I had a choice for myself.|sv|3503
A|That's true.|ba|3503
A|I mean, I don't know whether I'd stay in prison or not|sv|3503
A|or,|%|3503
B|Yeah,|b|3503
B|so, you said you're from Mississippi?|bf|3503
A|Yes, ma'am.|ny|3503
B|And do they have the death penalty there?|qy|3503
A|Yes,|ny|3503
A|they do.|sd|3503
A|I,|%|3503
A|they've had a, a number of cases here.|sd|3503
B|Uh-huh.|b|3503
A|I mean, not a whole lot,|sd|3503
A|well, Jackson, I heard just the other day had their sixty-first murder this year.|sd|3503
B|Uh-huh.|b|3503
A|It was like last like year they had forty-nine|sd|3503
A|so that's going up.|sd|3503
B|Uh-huh.|b|3503
A|But, yeah,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3503
A|they have a death penalty.|sd|3503
A|I hear of one every now and then.|sd|3503
B|Uh-huh.|b|3503
A|And I visited the prison up here and, at Parchman|sd|3503
B|Uh-huh.|b|3503
A|and I've been,|%|3503
A|I haven't,|%|3503
A|they won't let you on death row,|sd|3503
A|but they'll let you look down the hall.|sd|3503
A|You can't see any prisoners|sd|3503
A|and, and it's kind of a weird feeling.|sd|3503
A|I've been|%|3503
A|they took us around on a tour, you know,|sd|3503
A|and I went, got to walk in the gas chamber|sd|3503
B|Ooh.|ba|3503
A|and it is kind of a weird feeling knowing you're sitting there saying, like, people have died here.|sd|3503
B|That's right.|ba|3503
A|But I guess, just going up there and seeing the surroundings and stuff, the people up there,|sd|3503
