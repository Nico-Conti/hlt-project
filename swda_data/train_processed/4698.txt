A|Actually, I've been involved in electronics a long time. Uh, in computers|sd|4698
A|and I have really resisted the impulse to get one for the home. Uh, up until, I guess, maybe about a year and a half ago,|sd|4698
B|Oh yeah.|b|4698
A|I got one for my son. A, a Macintosh uh, L C.|sd|4698
B|Uh-huh.|b|4698
A|It's a real easy to use color, uh, computer|sd|4698
A|and I got a very nice printer that goes along with it|sd|4698
A|and he uses it for his school work.|sd|4698
B|Uh-huh.|b|4698
B|Well, I've, I'm currently in school|sd|4698
B|so I, I've had an I B M clone, I guess, for a couple of years now, which I've been trying, continually upgrading I guess.|sd|4698
B|And, uh, I've found, I've found that I pretty much become addicted to it|sd|4698
B|and I can't really,|%|4698
B|I've found that most of homework assignments really require some sort of computer, uh, simulation or analysis,|sd|4698
B|so|%|4698
A|Huh.|b|4698
B|it, it's very essential for me.|sd|4698
B|Schools have them,|sd|4698
B|uh, but lot of times so difficult to get on them at school.|sd|4698
B|It's very easy, it's much more convenient to have one at home.|sv|4698
A|Where you going to school?|qw|4698
B|At Georgia Tech.|sd|4698
A|I see.|bk|4698
B|Yeah,|b|4698
B|so.|%|4698
A|In engineering?|qy^d|4698
B|Yes, actually.|ny|4698
A|So that explains all the, uh, computer assignments.|bf|4698
B|Yeah,|b|4698
B|it, uh,|%|4698
A|Well, do you use your P C for things other than explicit computer work?|qy|4698
B|Um, sure.|na|4698
B|I have some games, of course, which I play on there|sd|4698
B|and, uh, uh, I have a program which allows me to access a, uh, weather data bank|sd|4698
B|so I can, like, check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby.|sd|4698
B|So, it provides other means other than just strict, uh, you know, computations and so on,|sd|4698
B|so. Have you, do you have a computer for yourself at home?|qy|4698
A|No.|nn|4698
A|No,|nn|4698
A|I just have one for my son|sd|4698
A|and I really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for  home computing.|sv|4698
B|Oh, yeah.|b|4698
B|Yeah.|b|4698
A|At at work, uh, I'm a technologist, uh,|sd|4698
A|and I, in the past, have done a great deal of, of, uh, system development just through, uh, software development programming.|sd|4698
A|Uh, but now I find myself using the computer,|sd|4698
A|even the computer at work is primarily a, uh, word processing system and a communication system.|sv|4698
B|Uh-huh.|b|4698
B|Yeah,|b|4698
B|yeah.|b|4698
B|Do you use Email and like that?|qy|4698
A|Yes.|ny|4698
A|Emil is, probably pulls down a third of all my time.|sd|4698
B|Yeah.|b|4698
B|It's,|%|4698
B|I, I, uh, I have modem night computer|sd|4698
B|so I can log into the the, uh, network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there, which is, which can be useful.|sd|4698
B|But, uh, yeah|%|4698
B|that's, that and word processing is|%|4698
B|while I tend to,|sd|4698
B|I mean, obviously, I do most of my, almost all of my report writing on, on my computer, uh, whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments.|sd|4698
A|Uh-huh.|b|4698
B|So it's, it's really become, I don't know, really become my mainstay I guess.|sd|4698
B|I can't even remember,|h|4698
B|actually I don't think I've ever used a typewriter in, in my life to do a, a to do a report. Because my family, when I was growing up, we got a basic computer. T R S Eighty when they first came out.|sd|4698
A|Uh-huh.|b|4698
B|And I even used that to do my first reports when I was in junior high,|sd|4698
B|so|%|4698
A|Huh. Well I'm a old-timer.|sd|4698
A|I did my Master's thesis on, uh, a typewriter.|sd|4698
B|Oh, yeah.|b|4698
A|Uh, I rented an I B M Selectric.|sd|4698
B|Oh.|b|4698
A|And it was a pretty big deal.|sd|4698
B|Yeah.|b|4698
B|It must have been tough.|ba|4698
B|It's a little bit strange for me.|sv|4698
B|I, I did my Master's thesis, uh, last year|sd|4698
B|and I did that on a computer|sd|4698
B|and it seems like,|sv|4698
B|I just can't imagine how people did it before.|sd|4698
B|It must have been just so much, so much work|sv|4698
A|Yeah.|aa|4698
A|It, uh, well, you know, it's just, it was just a completely different world then.|sv|4698
B|Yeah.|b|4698
B|So, uh, so you used your son's Macintosh then?|qy|4698
B|Do you, do you find it, do you like that kind of computer?|qy|4698
A|I like it,|na|4698
A|yeah.|ny|4698
A|I like it from a distance really.|sd|4698
A|I, I see the packages on it, uh, that are available|sd|4698
A|and it's nice.|sv|4698
A|I really don't use it myself.|sd|4698
B|Uh-huh.|b|4698
A|Uh, I, when I come home from work, I, I like to stay far away from computers and electronic things|sd|4698
B|Yeah.|b|4698
B|Huh.|b|4698
A|Uh, so I let my son do it|sd|4698
A|and, Uh, of course, you know, there's, uh, there's an intellectual evolution taking place where,|sv|4698
B|Yeah.|b|4698
A|it's sort of a joke|h|4698
A|but it's really true,|sv|4698
A|the old-timers, even the people who are technologists don't know how to operate these electronic things like V C R and whatnot|sv|4698
A|and the kids, they just take to it like candy.|sv|4698
B|Yeah.|b|4698
B|Well, if, if, if the interface is there so that it's like fun to use and the challenge|sv|4698
