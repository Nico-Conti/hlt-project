A|For N I S T, the National Institute of Standards and Technology.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3476
B|Oh, okay,|bk|3476
B|so it's right up your alley, then.|qy^d|3476
A|I suppose so.|na|3476
A|Let me push the button.|ad|3476
B|All right.|aa|3476
A|Okay, uh,|b|3476
A|I guess I'm supposed to be all for switching to the metric system,|sd|3476
A|but, uh, I sense that it's not going to happen anytime soon.|sv|3476
B|Yeah,|aa|3476
B|I don't think it's going to happen either,|sv|3476
B|but I wish it were|sd|3476
B|because I'm a, I got my bachelor's in mechanical engineering.|sd|3476
A|Uh-huh.|b|3476
B|I'm at grad school now in acoustics|sd|3476
B|and all we do is metric stuff.|sd|3476
A|You're now in what?|br|3476
B|Acoustics.|sd|3476
A|Acoustics, uh.|b^m|3476
B|Yeah,|aa|3476
B|so everything's metric|sd|3476
B|and then you go to read some order book or something|sd|3476
B|and it's all confusing|sd|3476
B|so I don't understand as much,|sd|3476
B|so I think we should get one adopted permanently.|sv|3476
A|Well, I guess that is the policy,|sd|3476
A|but it's been the policy for a long time|sd|3476
A|and nothing ever happens.|sv|3476
A|Uh, I suppose things, some things well happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that's happening, having a new generation come up that's more used to it.|sv|3476
B|Yeah,|aa|3476
B|a lot of industry out there is doing metric stuff because they have to.|sd|3476
A|They have to for international trade.|bf|3476
B|Yeah.|aa|3476
A|But, I guess it's, it's easier to switch back and forth than it used to be, uh, because of, of, uh, of computers coming into everything.|sv|3476
B|Uh-huh.|aa|3476
B|Yeah,|aa|3476
B|I don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal.|sv|3476
B|I think people need to understand more like what a meter is, instead of how many feet in a meter or something. Just get used to using all the terms.|sv|3476
B|Because someone says a kilogram,|sd|3476
B|no one knows what that is.|sv|3476
A|Everyone wants a, wants a conversion of that before kind of recognizing it as a, as, as, as, as a concept to hold in mind.|sv|3476
B|Yeah.|b|3476
A|Uh, I, I, I don't see that, it, it, it can change it very quickly.|sv|3476
A|I mean we're not the kind of society that, that, uh, that something can be posed upon, uh, by government will.|sv|3476
B|Yeah,|aa|3476
B|no one seems to be adopting it.|sv|3476
B|Metric system, no one's very, uh, no one wants it at all seems like.|sv|3476
A|Uh, the, the, the public is just very conservative that way in refusing to change measurement systems, uh, money, dollar, coins, anything like that.|sv|3476
B|Yeah|b|3476
A|And, and, and it it obviously makes no sense that we're practically alone in the world in, in using the old system.|sv|3476
B|Yeah,|aa|3476
B|I, it's pretty tough when you get everything confused, though.|sv|3476
B|I think two systems is worse than one, though|sv|3476
B|Because, I know, we do a lot of problems and things|sd|3476
B|and they're half english and half metric|sd|3476
B|and you, you make more mistakes doing all the conversions than you would doing the problems.|sd|3476
B|just get one.|sv|3476
B|I prefer metric,|sd|3476
B|but even if it's english, they should just have one.|sv|3476
A|Well, I mean, I think people like you are relatively rare who are coming up against this problem every day.|sv|3476
B|Yeah|aa|3476
B|yeah,|aa|3476
B|I think so.|sv|3476
B|Your, your average guy jogging down the highway wants to know how many miles it is to his destination.|sv|3476
A|Uh, I mean, there are things you could do.|sv|3476
A|Uh, we have signs up on the N I S T campus here, speed limit twenty-five miles per hour, forty kilometers per hour.|sd|3476
B|Yeah.|b|3476
A|Uh, but that hasn't been adopted very widely.|sd|3476
B|Yeah,|b|3476
B|they have some of those in Ohio.|sd|3476
B|There's this one sign's kind of funny.|sd|3476
B|It says, uh, metric signs next hundred miles.|sd|3476
A|But, I mean, and no one will, will go a step further to remove the english signs.|sv|3476
B|Yeah,|aa|3476
B|that would force everybody to use it. Or to quit selling tape measures in inches.|sv|3476
A|Uh, yeah,|aa|3476
A|or, you have highway signs saying speed limit, uh, eighty, eighty-five, whatever would be the appropriate number.|sv|3476
B|Yeah,|aa|3476
B|I guess a hundred is sixty-two.|sd|3476
A|Hundred car is going sixty-two,|bf|3476
A|yeah,|b|3476
A|so it would be more like, uh, like ninety I guess,|sd|3476
A|car is going fifty-five.|sd|3476
A|Uh, you suddenly have a have a even worse problem with speeding than we do now.|sv|3476
B|Yeah,|aa|3476
B|you have a bunch of people trying to do ninety|sv|3476
A|Do, do, do you know, where you are,|qy|3476
A|do the schools emphasize the metric system?|qy|3476
B|Yeah,|ny|3476
B|in the engineering they all do pretty much.|sd|3476
A|No,|ar|3476
A|I, I, I meant, I meant down, like, in the elementary schools.|sd|3476
B|Oh, in the elementary schools.|bf|3476
B|I don't know.|no|3476
B|I wouldn't think so.|sd|3476
B|I remember a ways back we did like conversions,|sd|3476
A|I mean, I think,|%|3476
B|but we never actually went out and measured anything or did anything on one system.|sd|3476
A|Yeah,|b|3476
A|I mean, I think my children learned the metric system,|sd|3476
A|but it doesn't get, get emphasized over the other.|sd|3476
B|Yeah,|b|3476
B|they learn how many centimeters are in an inch|bf|3476
B|and that's about it.|sv|3476
