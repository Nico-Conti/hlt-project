A|Well, um, since I'm in college, uh, I mean, uh, I haven't seen that much change|sd|3429
A|I'm kind of young still,|sd|3429
A|I don't know how much it changed in the last, uh, twenty years anyway.|sd|3429
A|But, I don't know.|h|3429
A|Do you, do you have an idea of, of how much.|qy|3429
B|No,|nn|3429
B|I'm not that old either|sd|3429
A|Uh-huh.|b|3429
B|I'm only twenty-nine.|sd|3429
A|Oh, okay.|bk|3429
B|So, social changes aren't that much for me either.|sd|3429
A|Yeah,|b|3429
A|right.|b|3429
A|Well, I can remember are from, from my childhood were the disco days|sd|3429
A|and maybe that's changed a lot. Uh the way, the way people dress|sv|3429
B|Well, yeah,|b|3429
B|that.|%|3429
A|and, uh.|%|3429
B|I think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be.|sv|3429
A|More lax?|br|3429
B|Uh-huh,|aa|3429
B|relaxed and laid back and stuff|sv|3429
A|Uh-huh.|b|3429
B|and.|%|3429
A|Maybe a people are a little more open-minded than maybe they used to be.|sv|3429
B|I think so.|sd|3429
A|Uh-huh.|b|3429
B|I think so,|sd|3429
B|and a lot,|sd|3429
B|I think people are, are used to now saying what's, what's on their minds more more up front than they used to be.|sv|3429
A|Right.|b|3429
A|Right.|b|3429
A|Uh-huh.|b|3429
A|Especially with like a lot of the different organizations now like, you know, Pro-Life and, and uh, Choice in, in the special interest groups maybe um, like amnesty.|sv|3429
B|Right.|b|3429
A|Uh, yeah,|%|3429
A|maybe people are a little, a little more, uh, free to express their opinions, socially free.|sv|3429
B|Yeah,|aa|3429
B|I think so.|sd|3429
B|I think women have come out more too, on, on like child abuse and, and the wife beatings,|sv|3429
A|Oh, yeah.|aa|3429
A|Right.|b|3429
B|and and like you said, pro pro-choice and whatnot.|sv|3429
A|Uh-huh.|b|3429
A|Uh-huh.|b|3429
A|Uh-huh.|b|3429
A|Right.|b|3429
B|I think that's become more outstanding than it used to be where women, I think used to be a little bit afraid of coming out and saying something.|sv|3429
A|Right.|aa|3429
A|Just wasn't socially acceptable.|sv|3429
B|No,|aa|3429
B|huh-uh.|aa|3429
A|Yeah.|b|3429
A|Uh, maybe, maybe too a big social change that's, that's maybe for the worst is, uh, is, is how, um, the people's, uh, views on, on relationships has changed, you know,|sv|3429
A|and now we have, now we have several, you know, we have to worry about AIDS|sv|3429
A|and we have to worry about, uh, maybe people are becoming more aware, more, more afraid of relationships.|sv|3429
B|Right.|b|3429
B|Well, I know like when I was in high school and junior high and stuff and sitting down and having the sex talk with mom, you know and all that stuff,|sd|3429
A|Uh-huh.|b|3429
B|and, you know, we didn't have to talk about,|sd|3429
B|well basically her thing was just don't do it, you know|sd|3429
A|right.|b|3429
A|Yeah.|b|3429
B|but, I'm not, I'm not naive, to think that my children are not going to not do it.|sd|3429
A|Yeah.|b|3429
B|It wasn't that long that I was that young.|sd|3429
A|Yeah.|b|3429
B|And I've got a ten year old,|sd|3429
B|and, you know, he thought, he knows about condoms,|sd|3429
B|and and he knows about AIDS,|sd|3429
A|Uh-huh.|b|3429
B|and it's just different things you have to talk to them about now that you would never even have dreamt to have to say anything about.|sv|3429
A|Uh-huh.|b|3429
A|Yeah.|b|3429
A|Right.|aa|3429
A|It used to be that we were, that we were trying to protect morality.|sv|3429
A|Now it's we're protecting our lives.|sv|3429
A|It's a it's a much different,|sv|3429
B|Uh-huh.|b|3429
A|we have, you know,|%|3429
A|you can't just, just hope for abstinence.|sv|3429
B|No,|aa|3429
B|I don't, I think that's stupidity on parents' part.|sv|3429
B|I mean that's, sex is rampant,|sv|3429
A|Yeah.|b|3429
B|and it always will be,|sv|3429
B|and and I think, too, noticing the kids, that the fourth and fifth graders, which is what my son is and stuff, they, they're just, they're more, they're very open.|sd|3429
A|Yeah.|b|3429
A|Uh-huh.|b|3429
A|Uh-huh.|b|3429
B|I mean, the boys are very open because that's, that's all I have is boys, so that's all I'm around basically, is boys,|sd|3429
A|Uh-huh.|b|3429
A|Uh-huh.|b|3429
B|but they talk about things that I, my brother didn't talk about until he was in college you know,|sd|3429
A|Uh-huh.|b|3429
B|and, and they sit down|sd|3429
B|and they look at you right in the face|sd|3429
B|and they expect a truthful answer.|sd|3429
A|That's right.|aa|3429
B|You can't get them, give them, the, oh, you know, Cabbage Patch answers and stuff.|sd|3429
A|Yeah.|b|3429
B|They, they,|%|3429
B|that just does not go.|sd|3429
A|Right.|b|3429
B|And they can tell me, basically some things that I don't know|sd|3429
A|Uh-huh.|b|3429
B|But it, it's interesting, listening to them.|sd|3429
B|I think, I think the social changes in them, I think I see it more with that generation than I do with like our generation.|sd|3429
A|Uh-huh.|b|3429
A|Right,|aa|3429
A|right.|aa|3429
A|Yeah,|%|3429
A|I, I, I imagine you're right.|sv|3429
A|I, I teach swim lessons a lot,|sd|3429
A|and, and to see what, see what kids talk about when, uh, you know, they're, they're open about, well, you know,|sd|3429
A|kids are a lot more educated now than I think that, that, like we were, uh, at that age um, about a lot of things.|sv|3429
B|Yeah,|aa|3429
B|I do too.|sd|3429
A|You know, besides what, besides what they learn, uh, from, from our social environment is, uh, their education is just amazing.|sv|3429
A|Kids are, kids are learning, uh, you know,|sv|3429
A|their math is just,|sd|3429
A|every year, uh, algebra goes down a grade, you know,|sd|3429
A|and, and, uh, students learn it earlier.|sd|3429
B|I know,|sd|3429
B|well, my son, the, my fourth grader, he is,|sd|3429
