B|Actually, I'm in,|%|4666
B|like I said, I'm in Minneapolis|sd|4666
B|and the big thing up here, of course, is the twins. Uh,|sd|4666
A|I imagine you can't escape it|sv|4666
B|No,|aa|4666
B|it's, it's pretty pervasive.|sv|4666
B|It kind of goes into about all aspects of society I think up here.|sv|4666
B|But, uh, actually, I don't know how much of the World Series you caught last year,|qy^d|4666
B|but that was a lot of fun .|sd|4666
A|Well, of course, it was fun for you|sv|4666
B|Well, to be honest with you, I'm not from Minneapolis.|sd|4666
B|In fact, I've only been up here a few months|sd|4666
B|and I'm going back at the end of next month.|sd|4666
A|To?|qw|4666
B|Uh, Orlando, Florida.|sd|4666
A|Oh, really.|b|4666
B|So I'm not exactly a real Twins fan from birth or anything.|sd|4666
B|But,|%|4666
A|I was born and raised in, uh, near Miami and, uh, spent the  last twenty years in Dallas uh, where the Rangers played.|sd|4666
B|Oh, yeah.|b|4666
B|Oh.|b|4666
B|Uh-huh.|b|4666
A|And, uh, for the  last, uh, what, year, roughly year, I've been in San Francisco where there are two teams. The Oakland A and the San Francisco Giants.|sd|4666
B|Right.|b|4666
A|Uh, but honestly, you know, I, uh, I do my duty and watch the sports on, uh,  the newscasts|sd|4666
B|Oh, okay.|b|4666
A|but that's about all the exposure I have to sports.|sd|4666
B|Yeah,|b|4666
B|I haven't followed it real closely at all. Uh, except like I said, last year when the World Series rolled around, I did, I did follow that pretty religiously.|sd|4666
B|Went out into the bars, you know drank a beer, watched the game, had a a good time that way.|sd|4666
A|Uh-huh|b|4666
A|sure.|b|4666
B|But, uh,|%|4666
A|Well, I guess the, uh, San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A were like the leading teams a couple of years ago.|sv|4666
B|Is that right?|qy|4666
A|Well, I|%|4666
A|well I don't know.|h|4666
A|That's sort of what I gather.|h|4666
B|Uh-huh.|b|4666
A|Um, and, uh, I don't know.|h|4666
A|What is the prognosis for, uh, this year?|qw|4666
B|Uh, real good as far as I can tell.|sd|4666
B|People are pretty excited about it.|sv|4666
A|Good.|ba|4666
A|I, I assume that means good for the Minnesota|qy^d|4666
B|Well yeah|ny|4666
B|Sorry about that,|fa|4666
B|yeah.|%|4666
B|Uh, as far as the Twins are concerned, it seems to be real good.|sd|4666
B|Uh, my roommate went and saw them play on their season opener a couple of nights ago|sd|4666
B|and they, they won that one seven to one,|sd|4666
B|so, uh, that's pretty good I guess.|sd|4666
B|It looks like they'll be doing pretty well.|sd|4666
B|Are you still there?|qy|4666
A|Yep|ny|4666
B|Okay.|b|4666
B|I heard some noise on the line.|qy|4666
B|Didn't know what happened.|sd|4666
A|I think a train went by.|sd|4666
B|Oh, okay.|b|4666
B|All right.|b|4666
A|I know a train went by,|sd|4666
A|I don't know what the noise was|sd|4666
A|but I think it probably was the, the train.|sd|4666
B|Yeah.|b|4666
A|Well, I don't know.|h|4666
A|I, I, I don't even know, uh, who has been winning in, uh, as far as the, uh, San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A|sd|4666
A|but I think they both won their opener.|sd|4666
A|I, uh, sort of gathered that in my, uh, subliminal memory.|sd|4666
B|Uh-huh|b|4666
B|Well maybe that has, has good tidings for their, uh, for their season coming up.|sv|4666
B|I've actually got a friend that's living in San Francisco right now.|sd|4666
B|Uh, he's doing the same thing I'm doing which is, basically, uh, an internship.|sd|4666
B|We, we're both doctoral students|sd|4666
B|and he's  doing his with I B M|sd|4666
A|Huh.|b|4666
B|and I'm doing mine with Honeywell.|sd|4666
B|But, uh, I, I think he kind of follows the sports|sd|4666
B|and I think he's mentioned uh, the Oakland A a couple of times.|sd|4666
B|Uh  he may have watched them and seemed to think that they were pretty good.|sd|4666
A|Uh-huh.|b|4666
A|I guess they are different leagues.|sd|4666
A|Is that right?|qy|4666
A|The A|qy|4666
B|As far as I know,|na|4666
B|yeah.|%|4666
A|Yeah .|b|4666
B|And in the major leagues, I guess there is a couple of different divisions|sd|4666
B|and then, of course, there's the minors.|sd|4666
B|Uh, I don't know.|h|4666
B|I, I guess I'm one of those people that if I really made a concentrated effort, I could really probably get into baseball.|sd|4666
A|Uh-huh.|b|4666
B|Uh, but I was talking to my roommate a couple of nights ago, right after that game,|sd|4666
B|and he offered, you know, to take me to one of the games because, apparently, he'd bought, uh, he and four other people from Honeywell had bought a seat, or a row of seats actually, for the home games.|sd|4666
A|Uh-huh,|b|4666
A|uh-huh.|b|4666
B|But the thing is, there's like eighty-six home games per year.|sd|4666
B|So there's no, no way that you can ever use them all.|sd|4666
A|Eighty-six?|b^m|4666
B|Eighty-six.|sd|4666
B|I was amazed to hear that.|sd|4666
A|Huh!|ba|4666
B|You know, that's just the home games|sd|4666
B|and I, I thought it was a mistake|sd|4666
B|but he goes no .|sd|4666
A|Well they must play every day then.|sv|4666
B|Yeah.|b|4666
B|Well just about,|sd|4666
B|yeah.|%|4666
A|I mean eighty-six times two is a hundred sixty.|sd|4666
B|Yeah.|b|4666
B|And that's, you know,|%|4666
B|yeah|%|4666
B|that's almost,|%|4666
A|And that's, Lord, that's, uh, over five months worth.|sd|4666
B|That's a lot of baseball.|sd|4666
A|Even if they play every day, that's over five months worth.|sd|4666
B|Well, you, if you, if you consider it, the season starts,|sd|4666
B|well it's,|%|4666
B|the season started about a week and a half ago|sd|4666
B|and it ends with the World Series which usually takes place, I believe, in December or January.|sv|4666
A|No.|ar|4666
B|Yeah,|ny|4666
B|I think so.|sv|4666
B|It did last year, didn't it?|qy|4666
B|Or was it November?|qy|4666
A|That was the Super Bowl.|sd|4666
B|Maybe it was November I'm thinking about.|sd|4666
B|I know it was doggone cold up here. Uh,|sd|4666
A|I don't feel so bad.|sd|4666
A|I think you, you don't know all that much more than I do about baseball|sv|4666
B|Well, I know for sure it was,|sd|4666
A|I see,|b|4666
A|okay.|b|4666
B|And, and it was at least two months after I got up here.|sd|4666
A|Oh, really,|b|4666
A|okay .|b|4666
B|Yeah,|b|4666
B|so it had to be November anyway.|sd|4666
A|Well, I, I know, uh, the Super Bowl,|sd|4666
