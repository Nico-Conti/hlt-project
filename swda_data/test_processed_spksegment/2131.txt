A|Yeah.|b|2131|1
A|I took them up here to Collectors Records and was able to get a little money for them|sd|2131|1
B|Yeah.|b|2131|0
A|but, uh, my mother and dad use to, uh, own a restaurant,|sd|2131|1
B|It's hard to,|%|2131|0
B|Oh, yeah.|b|2131|0
A|and he had, uh, they had a, uh, nickelodeon, of course, in the restaurant,|sd|2131|1
B|Yeah.|b|2131|0

B|Well, that|%|2131|0
B|that's neat.|ba|2131|0
A|so, that's where I got my,|sd|2131|1
B|that would be great if they weren't too worn out, at the time.|sv|2131|0
A|Yeah.|b|2131|1
A|Of course, there's not a whole lot of market for seventy-eight R P M records.|sv|2131|1
B|Is there not?|qy|2131|0
B|You, you'd, well you'd think there would be.|sv|2131|0
A|Well, the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because, you have to have that needle, that, uh, particular kind of needle|sv|2131|1
B|Well, that's true.|aa|2131|0
B|Oh, yeah.|b|2131|0
A|and, uh, they, just won't play on a modern day, uh phonograph.|sd|2131|1
B|Well, that's a shame|ba|2131|0
B|because I, I, we go to antique stores a lot|sd|2131|0
B|and you see seventy-eights, a, a lot at, at the stores, at record stores,|sd|2131|0

A|Yeah.|b|2131|1
B|I'm, I'm sure you could find old players for them|sv|2131|0
B|but that would cost a fortune, if you could find them that worked|sv|2131|0
A|Yeah.|b|2131|1
A|Yeah.|b|2131|1
B|Oh.|b|2131|0
A|Of course, they, you know, just don't have the quality of records nowadays either because, you, you get that scratchy sound.|sv|2131|1
B|No.|aa|2131|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2131|0
B|Well, those things were big and thick weren't they?|qy|2131|0
A|Yeah,|ny|2131|1
A|yeah.|ny|2131|1
B|You could kill somebody with them|sv|2131|0
A|Yeah,|b|2131|1
A|warped real easy.|sd|2131|1
B|And the ones you buy,|sv|2131|0
B|go out and buy one now|ad|2131|0
B|and they're just so thin and, flimsy|sv|2131|0
A|Yeah.|b|2131|1

B|those things are practically indestructible|sv|2131|0
A|But, I, I guess, you know, the old country and western music you,|sd|2131|1
A|back then when I was a kid, there wasn't that much T V,|sd|2131|1
