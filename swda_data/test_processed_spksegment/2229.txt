B|Yeah,|ny|2229|1
B|and time consuming,|sd|2229|1
B|I mean it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming,|sv|2229|1
B|it's, uh, you know, afterwards, you know,|sv|2229|1
B|then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up, you know.|sv|2229|1

A|Yeah,|ny|2229|0
A|I haven't decided whether, whether I want to play yet or not|sd|2229|0
A|I just bought myself a solo flex machine,|sd|2229|0
A|I don't know if you've seen those advertised on T V.|qy^d|2229|0
B|Uh-huh.|ny|2229|1
A|It's one of those, uh, universal type machines, exercise machines.|sd|2229|0
A|But I haven't really sat down and used it match yet,|sd|2229|0
A|so it's collecting dust right now.|sd|2229|0
B|Yeah,|b|2229|1
B|a lot of things do that.|sv|2229|1
B|I had an, I had an exercise bike|sd|2229|1
A|I used to jog somewhat.|sd|2229|0
B|I use to have one,|sd|2229|1
B|and I finally got rid of sit cause I never used it,|sd|2229|1
B|but I do use my treadmill|sd|2229|1
A|Uh-huh,|b|2229|0
A|well, that's good.|ba|2229|0
A|Yeah,|%|2229|0
A|my parents have a treadmill|sd|2229|0
A|it's,|%|2229|0
A|when I go visit them, uh, I get on that thing every now and then.|sd|2229|0
B|Yeah,|b|2229|1
B|it's nice because when the weather's bad you can't, you don't have any excuse.|sv|2229|1
A|Uh-huh,|b|2229|0
A|I just got the bicycle out today,|sd|2229|0
A|and it was real nice outside,|sd|2229|0
A|had to get out to do something.|sd|2229|0
B|Yeah,|b|2229|1
B|I can't ride a bike|sd|2229|1
B|so.|%|2229|1
A|I've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold|sd|2229|0
A|so thought I, better, better get outside and do something and not waist the day.|sd|2229|0
B|Oh.|b|2229|1
B|Yeah,|b|2229|1
B|it's too nice,|sv|2229|1
B|it's been too nice all weekend.|sv|2229|1
A|But, uh, yeah,|b|2229|0
A|I need to start jog something again.|sv|2229|0
A|I've always of that to be, uh, really one of the best forms of exercise,|sv|2229|0
A|but it's terribly boring,|sv|2229|0
A|and so I really don't ever keep a program up consistently.|sd|2229|0
B|Have you ever had any injuries from jogging?|qy|2229|1
A|No,|nn|2229|0
A|I never have.|sd|2229|0
A|Well, I don't job enough I think to develop any injuries|sv|2229|0
A|I usually only go about a mile or two.|sd|2229|0
B|I guess it worries me about jogging it's that I hear that it's very hard on your body and, and that, you know, you can end up getting hurt, worse.|sd|2229|1
A|Yeah,|b|2229|0
A|it's, it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete, or on asphalt.|sv|2229|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2229|1
A|Suppose to be much better if you find grass, uh, or, or dirt to jog on.|sv|2229|0
B|Yeah,|b|2229|1
B|that's not quite so so easy.|sv|2229|1
A|You have to have the right, type of shoes too,|sv|2229|0
A|that's, very important.|sv|2229|0
B|Yeah.|b|2229|1
B|Yeah.|b|2229|1
B|I found that, true especially from walking on toe and fronts .|sd|2229|1
A|But,|%|2229|0
A|Yeah,|b|2229|0
A|I don't have to buy jogging shoes all to often|sd|2229|0
A|my don't get very much use|sd|2229|0
B|Well, I guess my breakdown about, they say about every six months.|sv|2229|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|2229|0
A|I usually enjoy the exercise I do|sd|2229|0
A|but, uh, like I said I'm just not very consistent about maintaining a, a program.|sd|2229|0
A|So I'll, I'll bicycle|sd|2229|0
A|I get into that for, for a little while and maybe go out, uh, on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile,|sd|2229|0
A|but then I'll get tired of doing that, and maybe start jogging again and go out about three or four nights a week.|sd|2229|0
A|But, uh, that gets old too in a very short order,|sd|2229|0
B|Yeah.|b|2229|1
A|I'm, I'm hoping that this, uh, solo flex will, uh, uh, change things a little bit,|sd|2229|0
A|I really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis.|sd|2229|0
B|Yeah,|b|2229|1
B|well, don't let it collect dust.|ad|2229|1
B|At least exercise while dusting it off|ad|2229|1
A|Yeah.|b|2229|0
B|well.|b|2229|1
A|Maybe if I can get interested in playing softball again this string I can, uh, start some type of, uh, regular program.|sd|2229|0
B|Yeah,|b|2229|1
B|that, that'll be good.|ba|2229|1
A|I've always found that, uh, when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep, uh, keep something going.|sd|2229|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2229|1
A|Uh, when I was in high school we had a choice of, uh, taking, uh, physical education courses on exercise,|sd|2229|0
A|an, uh, one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine, lifting weights and, uh, working out like that.|sd|2229|0
B|Oh.|b|2229|1
A|And that was very helpful|sd|2229|0
A|we kept charts of our progress, and, uh, consistently increased the empty of resistance so you could see how much you improved over the weeks.|sd|2229|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2229|1
A|I found that to be, uh, very helpful.|sd|2229|0
B|Are you going to do that?|qy|2229|1
A|Uh, I need to,|no|2229|0
A|I haven't started yet|sd|2229|0
A|but, uh, it's a thought.|sv|2229|0
B|Well, that sounds like something good to do then.|sv|2229|1
A|Sounds like something I should do.|sv|2229|0
B|Yeah,|b|2229|1
B|nice way to start off this spring. Get back in shape.|sv|2229|1
A|How often do you, uh, uh, go out each week on your walking?|qw|2229|0

B|I switch every other day|sd|2229|1
B|one day I walk|sd|2229|1
B|and one day I do the aerobics.|sd|2229|1
A|Okay,|bk|2229|0
A|how far, about how far do you go walking?|qw|2229|0
B|Well, I'm trying to get my tolerance now|^h|2229|1
B|I just had surgery, um, less then two months ago,|sd|2229|1
B|and right now I'm just a little over about a mile and a half,|sd|2229|1
A|Okay.|bk|2229|0
B|but I'm trying to workup to three miles.|sd|2229|1
A|Well, that's good.|ba|2229|0
A|Well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging.|sv|2229|0
B|Yeah,|b|2229|1
A|It,|%|2229|0
B|it takes, it's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect.|sv|2229|1
A|Sure.|b|2229|0
B|Yeah,|b|2229|1
B|but.|%|2229|1
A|Well, if you keep up with a consistent pace just to, uh, keep the heart rating going, uh,|sv|2229|0
B|My walkman broke,|sd|2229|1
A|Yeah.|b|2229|0
B|so I'm upset|sd|2229|1
B|and I just have to turn to stereo up real loud|sd|2229|1
A|Yeah.|b|2229|0
A|But it's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is.|sv|2229|0
