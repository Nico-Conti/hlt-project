B|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|2151|0
A|Okay.|b^m|2151|1
B|Well what do you think about the idea of, uh, kids having to do public service work for a year?|qw|2151|0
B|Do you think it's a|qy|2151|0
A|Well, I, I think it's a pretty good idea.|sv|2151|1
A|I think they should either do that, or, or afford some time to the military, or, or helping elderly people.|sv|2151|1
B|Yes,|aa|2151|0
B|yes,|aa|2151|0
A|I, I, you know, I think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help|sv|2151|1
A|and I think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and, and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home|sv|2151|1
A|and I'm not sure that that's not a bad idea|sv|2151|1
B|That's true.|aa|2151|0
A|and, or the military for a year or two, wouldn't be bad for,|sv|2151|1
B|Yeah.|b|2151|0
A|I think it teaches kids how to grow.|sv|2151|1
A|How about yourself?|qo|2151|1
B|Uh, I agree with you.|aa|2151|0
B|Uh, uh, what I'm thinking about is back well, when I was a kid, and much earlier than that, kids were kind of,|sd|2151|0
B|you know, the parents kind of pushed them to join, like the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts|sv|2151|0
B|and they did, do, do do a lot of public service activities,|sv|2151|0
B|but these days they're not, uh,|sv|2151|0
B|parents aren't encouraging their kids to do things like that.|sv|2151|0
B|Because when I was in the Girl Scouts, we did a lot of public service things, because that's just part of, of the scouting, and, you know.|sd|2151|0
A|Yeah,|b|2151|1
A|I've, I've,|%|2151|1
A|that's really great.|sv|2151|1
A|I, I really think that both the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts is a excellent, two excellent organizations.|sv|2151|1
B|They are|aa|2151|0
B|but parents,|%|2151|0
A|You know, kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that,|sv|2151|1
B|Yeah,|aa|2151|0
B|they do.|aa|2151|0
A|and they don't follow it at all, you know.|sv|2151|1
A|There are very few Scouts go on, and become Eagle Scouts.|sv|2151|1
B|Oh, no.|aa|2151|0
A|And, and I don't know what the high rank is for the gals|sd|2151|1
A|but,|%|2151|1
B|I, I, uh,|%|2151|0
B|senior.|sd|2151|0
A|Oh.|b|2151|1
A|Senior,|b^m|2151|1
A|okay.|bk|2151|1
A|So, there's not, uh,|%|2151|1
B|Oh, they're just not,|%|2151|0
B|once they get into junior high it just, not done anymore|sv|2151|0
A|Yeah,|b|2151|1
A|they, they lose interest.|sv|2151|1
A|and then when they young, young adults, there's even less interest there.|sv|2151|1
B|Uh-huh.|b|2151|0
A|They're more for, I|sv|2151|1
B|Me|^2|2151|0
A|Not, not,|%|2151|1
A|yeah.|aa|2151|1
B|Grab,|sd|2151|0
B|grab,|sd|2151|0
B|grab,|sd|2151|0
B|walk out|sd|2151|0
A|Yeah,|aa|2151|1
A|you're absolutely right|sv|2151|1
B|Yeah|b|2151|0
A|I think it's a really a good thing.|sv|2151|1
A|I, I like to see,|sd|2151|1
A|of course, there's, you know, third world countries that can use all kind of help|sv|2151|1
B|Yeah,|b|2151|0
B|but there's a lot that can be done right here in this country, too.|sv|2151|0
A|But I think, we ought to start right here at home.|sv|2151|1
A|I'm, you know,|%|2151|1
B|Yeah,|b|2151|0
B|uh, I'm not, I'm not so sure that overseas help, helping overseas would be such a hot idea for, for, uh, a lot of young people.|sv|2151|0
A|No,|aa|2151|1
A|it, it,|%|2151|1
B|But, since there is much that needs to be done here.|sv|2151|0
A|I think that, yeah, I think that we need to really address what we've done here|sv|2151|1
A|and, and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook.|sv|2151|1
B|Uh-huh.|b|2151|0
A|Well, it's been really good.|sv|2151|1
A|We talked about this for a few minutes,|sd|2151|1
A|and, uh, hopefully, we'll have other good topic maybe another call someday,|sd|2151|1
A|but I, I don't really have too much more to say on this topic, I guess.|sd|2151|1
B|No,|b|2151|0
B|I, I agree with you|sd|2151|0
A|It, we, I guess we both agree that it's a good thing, that they should do sometime.|sv|2151|1
B|Yeah.|b|2151|0
B|Okay.|aa|2151|0
A|Well you take care,|fc|2151|1
