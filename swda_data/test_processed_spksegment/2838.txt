B|Gun control seems to be a rather, uh, timely topic, with all that's going on legislation wise.|sv|2838|0
A|Yes|aa|2838|1
B|And, uh, the, the interesting scale that they assigned it, uh, the one being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free|sd|2838|0
B|I'd have to put myself pretty much in the middle, I guess.|sv|2838|0
B|I, I don't mind regulating all of the, the guns|sv|2838|0
B|and I would certainly call for a ban on certain types.|sv|2838|0
B|Now the, the wisdom as to which types, that's going to be a debate forever, I would assume.|sv|2838|0
B|Uh, the method of, of controlling it, well that's all into how much money you want to put into the, the controls.|sv|2838|0
B|Uh, one point that was made in the House hearings|sd|2838|0
B|or|%|2838|0
B|the representative stood up and said, you know, we can check a guy's credit card instantly,|sd|2838|0
B|but, uh, we don't want to check his background,|^q|2838|0
B|and of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes|sv|2838|0
A|Right.|b|2838|1
B|uh,|%|2838|0
B|but there still, the, the technology exists to, to check it if they want.|sd|2838|0
B|So, it's, it's kind of a,|%|2838|0
B|I guess you could put a dollar figure on it if you really want to make that kind of an effort and regulate it like that.|sv|2838|0
B|And then you've got the group of people that decide that there's, there's no particular reason to have them at all|sd|2838|0
B|and you got to balance those against the ones that say there is some sport to it|sv|2838|0
B|and I guess I would fall more in the, the realm that I like the sport issue of it,|sv|2838|0
B|but I, I could give it up without too much trouble,|sd|2838|0
B|not the world's most pleasurable thing|sv|2838|0
B|and it costs a bit to do it, uh, finding ranges and things like that.|sv|2838|0
A|Yes|b|2838|1
A|Right.|b|2838|1
B|Uh, I have shot a variety of guns for a number of years,|sd|2838|0
B|but it's just not like golf or whatever.|sv|2838|0
B|I mean there are other things that you could go do.|sv|2838|0
B|So, uh, I, I don't see the, the joy of shooting as, as that much of a driving factor.|sv|2838|0
B|I think that society could easily swing the scales the other direction just for the sake of safety of the number of kids that tend to get hurt,|sv|2838|0
A|Yeah.|b|2838|1
B|I don't even keep the gun in our house,|sd|2838|0
A|Right.|b|2838|1
B|so I don't have that problem,|sd|2838|0
B|but, uh,|%|2838|0
B|it's a hard, hard topic, I guess.|sv|2838|0
B|A lot of people have a hard issue, a lot of hard feelings about it.|sv|2838|0
A|They do,|aa|2838|1
A|and you, boy you can get them on either side|sd|2838|1
A|and just like you say,|sd|2838|1
A|uh, well I think I, I guess I'd have to place myself, uh, probably seven or eight|sv|2838|1
A|because,|%|2838|1
A|or not,|ar|2838|1
A|onto no control,|sd|2838|1
A|I'm sorry, excuse me, that,|fa|2838|1
A|uh, two or three.|sd|2838|1
B|Uh-huh.|b|2838|0
A|I was going the wrong direction.|sd|2838|1
A|Uh, because of, we had a neighbor child that was killed by another child because they had a gun in the house|sd|2838|1
A|and the father kept the bullets in a separate place,|sd|2838|1
A|but the little boy was five years old and was intelligent enough to,|sd|2838|1
A|uh, he knew where booth, both places were, loaded the gun|sd|2838|1
A|and they were playing cowboys and Indians|sd|2838|1
A|and he shot the other little boy right between the eyes.|sd|2838|1
A|So, uh,|%|2838|1
A|I mean it,|sd|2838|1
A|it destroyed two families uh, in just that instant|sd|2838|1
B|Right.|b|2838|0
A|and, and I, a lot of people say that they need it for protection, uh,|sv|2838|1
A|having worked at one time in Baltimore,|sd|2838|1
A|or,|%|2838|1
A|I don't know if you're in the big city,|sd|2838|1
B|Dallas.|sd|2838|0
A|are you,|qy|2838|1
A|Dallas?|br|2838|1
B|Uh-huh.|ny|2838|0
A|That's a big city|sv|2838|1
B|Yeah.|b|2838|0
A|Uh, then you know that, uh, uh,|%|2838|1
A|if you live anywhere real close that, uh,|sv|2838|1
A|the safety is, uh,|%|2838|1
A|some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that they aren't going to get shot because of the incidences of break ins and, you know.|sv|2838|1
A|But, uh, uh, we have never had a gun in the house with my children growing up.|sd|2838|1
A|Uh, I, uh,|%|2838|1
A|once, uh, uh, knew a fellow that had, had been a policeman|sd|2838|1
A|and he said that if you pull a gun on a robber, he's going to assume that you know how to use it well,|sd|2838|1
A|and he's going to, you know, try to shoot first.|sd|2838|1
B|Right.|b|2838|0
A|Uh, so, you know, if he's got one.|sd|2838|1
A|Uh, and if not,|sd|2838|1
A|uh, then usually they, uh,|sd|2838|1
A|if he's got a knife or whatever that can throw it at you,|sd|2838|1
A|I mean, you know they, they,|%|2838|1
B|Right.|b|2838|0
A|he said that it, it was better not to have,|sd|2838|1
A|especially myself, now I'm a widow,|sd|2838|1
A|and, uh,|%|2838|1
A|I, so I'm, when my handicapped son is, is not at home, I'm by myself,|sd|2838|1
A|but, uh, there's,|%|2838|1
A|I still won't have a gun in the house because he said it's really uh, playing Russian Roulette if you do|sd|2838|1
A|Uh,|%|2838|1
B|Yeah.|b|2838|0
B|About the only circumstances that they'd be of any value is when you happen to already know that the, the, person was coming your way.|sv|2838|0
B|Once you're surprised, it's too late.|sv|2838|0
A|That's right.|aa|2838|1
B|And, and the rare,|%|2838|0
A|That's right.|aa|2838|1
B|you know, the very few of those burglaries actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming,|sv|2838|0
A|Right.|b|2838|1
B|and had time to do anything about it.|sv|2838|0
A|That's right.|aa|2838|1
B|And, I don't have that problem,|sd|2838|0
B|as I don't use that argument as saying it's worth keeping one.|sd|2838|0
B|In the, uh, N R As, uh, claim that the, uh, the constitutional, the right to bear arms and that whole statement, uh,|sd|2838|0
B|it's hard to know the original intent,|sv|2838|0
B|but I, I don't see it as that, that difficult of a story to believe when the opposition says that, uh, yeah, it's the right to, to arm a militia and, as opposed to just the general public.|sv|2838|0
A|Right.|b|2838|1
B|And you have a, you have a earn a right,|sv|2838|0
B|not just a privilege as it were if you're going to serve in the militia,|sv|2838|0
B|then you have a right to have that arm,|sv|2838|0
B|but, uh,|%|2838|0
A|That's right.|aa|2838|1
B|you know, there's all sorts of arguments there|sd|2838|0
A|I know|aa|2838|1
B|but, I don't even want to worry about what the original intent was,|sd|2838|0
A|No.|b|2838|1
B|they didn't have this problem back then|sd|2838|0
A|No,|aa|2838|1
A|that's true.|aa|2838|1
A|That, That's, that's right,|aa|2838|1
B|So, we change our rights with our social status.|sv|2838|0
A|that's right.|aa|2838|1
B|They're man given rights|sd|2838|0
B|and they can be taken away by a man,|sd|2838|0
B|so,|%|2838|0
A|Right.|b|2838|1
B|uh, the people that hide behind that, I don't worry about.|sd|2838|0
B|They can go live in another country if they want.|sd|2838|0
A|Well, yeah,|b|2838|1
A|that's how I feel, too.|sd|2838|1
A|I know, well,|sd|2838|1
A|even here where I work, uh, we have a, a gun club.|sd|2838|1
A|And, of course, those people are very avid.|sd|2838|1
A|They, you know, they say there should be no ban,|sd|2838|1
B|Uh-huh.|b|2838|0
A|that it's not,|%|2838|1
A|but I can't see why any, uh, on the street citizen should be able to be allowed to have a machine gun.|sv|2838|1
B|Right.|b|2838|0
A|Uh, you know, when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns that would be hard to decide,|sv|2838|1
A|but there are a few guns that, uh, just are not, uh, sport,|sv|2838|1
A|or, I mean,|%|2838|1
A|I don't know too many people that use a machine gun to go sport hunting either|sd|2838|1
B|Right.|b|2838|0
A|So, uh, I, I think they should have at least some control over, over those things.|sv|2838|1
A|Uh, and when you were speaking about how they can check up, you know, on credit cards,|sd|2838|1
A|well, I, I understand about the privacy act and everything,|sd|2838|1
A|but why can't they check to see if the person who is applying for this gun has had a record or not.|qw|2838|1
A|That, to me, would not be an unreasonable thing.|sv|2838|1
B|Right.|b|2838|0
A|And if they do,|sd|2838|1
A|course the argument with the people in the gun club, uh, is that, uh, well the people that are going to get guns are the ones that are going to steal them anyway.|sd|2838|1
B|Right.|b|2838|0
A|And so, it's not going to be that they're buying them.|sd|2838|1
A|Course, some of them do.|sv|2838|1
B|Yeah.|b|2838|0
A|So it, it is a hard question|sv|2838|1
B|Tends to, tends to strap only the legitimate people.|bf|2838|0
B|Most regulation does|sv|2838|0
A|Right,|aa|2838|1
A|oh, yeah.|aa|2838|1
B|and, most,|%|2838|0
B|it's very difficult to, uh, legislate, uh, crooks or whatever you want, however you want to word it|sv|2838|0
A|That's right.|aa|2838|1
B|so it's,|%|2838|0
B|well, this may be a never ending topic.|sv|2838|0
B|I got a couple of calls waiting on me,|sd|2838|0
B|so I'd better let you go.|fc|2838|0
A|Okay,|fc|2838|1
A|well thanks for talking.|fc|2838|1
B|Okay, bye.|fc|2838|0
A|Bye-bye now.|fc|2838|1
