A|I'm not sure.|sd|4728|1
B|Yeah.|b|4728|0
A|We have to, we, we'll have to face it in a couple of years|sd|4728|1
A|but, uh,  I, I guess, we had a small Toyota wagon|sd|4728|1
B|Right.|b|4728|0
A|and we were real happy with that because, uh, my, my second requirement after price is, uh, low maintenance.|sd|4728|1
B|Right.|b|4728|0
A|And, uh, it certainly had that.|sd|4728|1
A|We didn't do much to it at all.|sd|4728|1

A|Uh-huh.|b|4728|1
B|And then, of course, two weeks ago, it decided,|sd|4728|0
B|I don't know,|h|4728|0

A|Huh.|b|4728|1
A|Well that was, ,|%|4728|1
B|And that was it|sd|4728|0
B|because I, I have that|sd|4728|0
B|and then I have a, a Kawasaki motorcycle. Which is, actually, the, usually my preferred mode of transportation if I can take it and it's not raining.|sd|4728|0
A|Uh-huh.|b|4728|1
A|Yeah.|b|4728|1
B|I mean that's, that's sort of my, hobby though more than a vehicle.|sd|4728|0

B|I don't know,|h|4728|0
B|people who buy motorcycles for transportation I think are kidding themselves|sd|4728|0

A|Uh .|%|4728|1
A|Yeah|b|4728|1
B|But, yeah,|b|4728|0
B|I, I mean, the only thing I think I might get, a new car or, not necessarily a new car but, a, another car,|sd|4728|0
B|uh, I would consider going to a, a non, to a normal pickup rather than a, a covered pickup like the one I've got. Just because there's a lot of times I wished I had, just an open bed to throw stuff in.|sd|4728|0
A|Right.|b|4728|1
B|I'm sure, I'm sure that that's very,|sv|4728|0
B|I mean you got one.|sv|4728|0
B|It's, that's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back|sd|4728|0

B|To have it out of the way.|^2|4728|0
B|Right.|b|4728|0
A|But, uh, they're solid.|sd|4728|1
