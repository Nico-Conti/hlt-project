A|Well, I really enjoy reading the newspaper,|sd|2205|0
A|we get the daily, uh, DALLAS MORNING NEWS|sd|2205|0
A|and I try to look at it.|sd|2205|0
A|If I get busy I don't get a chance to pick it up, like this week I noticed several copies have been haven't been touched|sd|2205|0
A|but|%|2205|0
B|Well, do you have time to read the paper in the morning?|qy|2205|1
A|Well, not in the morning,|ng|2205|0
A|but, uh, if the,|%|2205|0
A|well, I have two children|sd|2205|0
A|and if they, uh, go out to play or something I like to keep my eye on them so I'll, you know, maybe go outside and read the paper while they're playing or sit in a chair by the window or something.|sd|2205|0
B|You know, a lot, a lot of people don't take newspapers at all.|sv|2205|1
B|We, we took the MORNING NEWS for a while,|sd|2205|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|2205|0
B|and then, uh, well, we've been taking the TIMES HERALD for ages|sd|2205|1
B|and then, uh, dog just ran off with my shoe, that's off the subject, went outside, picked it up and ran off.|sd|2205|1
B|Anyway, uh, and then we switched the MORNING NEWS|sd|2205|1
B|but we found we couldn't read enough of it|sd|2205|1
B|and by the time I got home and had time to, to read some,|sd|2205|1
B|but, but I guess the, the issue is, uh, beside the newspaper, do you take any news magazines?|qy|2205|1
A|Well, we, I don't take, like TIME, or NEWSWEEK or anything like that,|ng|2205|0
A|but I do like to watch, uh, C N N.|sd|2205|0
A|I have several chores and things to do,|sd|2205|0
A|so it comes on at, like the nine o'clock p m|sd|2205|0
A|and so I will turn that on while I'm doing some work|sd|2205|0
A|and I can hear the news, not have to sit right down and listen to it.|sd|2205|0
B|Did, did you, did you hear what Schwartzkopf had to say about, uh, Pete Arnett, and, uh, the, the news coverage?|qy|2205|1
A|Well, he didn't have too good of opinion of it,|na|2205|0
A|no,|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|2205|0
A|I mean yes I did hear that|sd|2205|0
A|and so, uh, I do try to keep that in mind that whenever you're reading a paper it usually has a particular flavor.|sd|2205|0
B|Well any, you know, TIME magazine and even the news that,|sd|2205|1
B|sometimes that,|%|2205|1
B|that's why I like some diversity the idea that, I, we have TIME which, which we take from time to time|sd|2205|1
B|and we,|%|2205|1
B|the problem is they call up and make this deal, you know,|sd|2205|1
B|and, well we're taking that|sd|2205|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|2205|0
B|and, and we also hit the Garland, GARLAND DAILY NEWS,|sd|2205|1
B|I guess it's, it comes out sporadically, like, twice a week or|sd|2205|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|2205|0
B|but I think what's interesting is that if you're, that there, uh, that as difficult as it is, or as, as much as they try, they put some bias,|sd|2205|1
B|I had the chance to hear Tracy Rowlett speak to a group|sd|2205|1
B|and it was interesting that they think that they're basically impartial.|sv|2205|1
A|Um.|%|2205|0
B|And that,|%|2205|1
B|but, and, and, you know, people accuse them of controlling the news he says, you know, we don't control the news we just report it the way we, the way it is.|sd|2205|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|2205|0
B|And,|%|2205|1
A|Well, I wouldn't think I would really say that that's not true, because uh, it seems like certain newspapers always espouse certain candidates,|sv|2205|0
B|Yes.|b|2205|1
A|and, so, uh, news stations always tell the story from a certain angle|sv|2205|0
A|and that's why it's a good idea to get a wide variety of coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions.|sv|2205|0
A|You may never get the truth,|sv|2205|0
A|but you'll have a variety to choose from.|sv|2205|0
B|Yeah,|b|2205|1
B|and I, I thought that was particularly interesting in the, the Gulf War, that there were pieces of information that, that were apparently, uh, leaked just as a, as, as, uh, a ploy.|sv|2205|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|2205|0
B|Which was, uh,|%|2205|1
B|I, I find that fascinating that, uh,|%|2205|1
A|Yeah,|b|2205|0
A|I do, too.|sd|2205|0
A|Do you ever listen to the radio|qy|2205|0
A|or any,|%|2205|0
B|I listen to K R L D, and, uh, uh, K L I F, the news talk radio.|na|2205|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|2205|0
B|And I actually listen to C N N radio.|sd|2205|1
B|Do you know it was on radio now?|qy|2205|1
A|No,|nn|2205|0
A|I don't.|sd|2205|0
B|It's on eleven ninety.|sd|2205|1
A|Um. I really, uh, have gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio from any kind of, even music|sd|2205|0
A|and, uh,|%|2205|0
B|Well, when I go to work I listen.|sd|2205|1
A|Yeah,|b|2205|0
A|my husband does|sd|2205|0
A|and it's how come he usually calls me sometimes, and says, oh, I just heard on the news that such and such happened, you know, if it's something really interesting|sd|2205|0
A|and and then I'll know to, to keep an eye out for it,|sd|2205|0
B|Yeah.|b|2205|1
A|but I've got out of the habit of listening to the radio.|sd|2205|0
B|Well, with, with your, you know,|%|2205|1
B|if you're around the home, though and, and, and can watch T V and read the paper, the problem is, is that about twenty minutes of news radio, or thirty minutes is|sv|2205|1
B|and then they start repeating everything.|sd|2205|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|2205|0
B|And, and so it's kind of a, oh,|%|2205|1
B|that's what's interesting is the C N N, uh,|sv|2205|1
B|I don't think, I'm trying to think if it's much local.|^h|2205|1
B|I listen to a little of that|sd|2205|1
B|and I listen to a little of ninety point one.|sd|2205|1
B|I, I'm, I'm inveterate switcher.|sd|2205|1
A|Uh-huh|b|2205|0
B|That and ninety-eight point seven, I'm eclectic approach.|sd|2205|1
A|Do you have a particular local channel that you watch?|qy|2205|0
B|Well, I watch channel five|na|2205|1
B|but that has to be,|sd|2205|1
B|that's another bias.|sd|2205|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|2205|0
B|That has to do with the weather reporting.|sd|2205|1
B|I'm not sure that,|%|2205|1
B|actually I think channel eight is probably,|sv|2205|1
B|but I know Dave Fox,|sd|2205|1
B|he goes to our church|sd|2205|1
B|so,|%|2205|1
A|Um. Well I am, we're fairly new to the area|sd|2205|0
A|and so we're still shopping for a favorite channel.|sd|2205|0
B|Well the, Channel eight when they came here thirteen, fourteen years ago, Dave Fox and Tracy Rowlett came together, uh, from Oklahoma City|sd|2205|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|2205|0
B|and apparently channel eight was way down|sd|2205|1
B|and now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable job|sd|2205|1
B|and then they've been some people move around|sd|2205|1
B|and, uh, John Chriswell is, anyway, the,|sd|2205|1
B|I, I don't know,|h|2205|1
B|do you, do you, do you seem to,|sv|2205|1
B|can you tell much difference between the local radio, T V stations?|qy|2205|1
A|Well, I really think so.|na|2205|0
A|I noticed on channel eight that there's all of the, uh, anchors, are seem to be like white Anglo Saxon protestant type people|sd|2205|0
A|and they all seem to be, you know, fairly similar|sd|2205|0
A|and I kind of prefer a, you know, some females,|sd|2205|0
A|I don't recall that they have any female anchors|sd|2205|0
A|and I like different, I like the anchors to be different kinds of people.|sd|2205|0
B|I think that adds to the diversity,|sd|2205|1
B|I think that, uh, I like that.|sd|2205|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|2205|0
B|Uh, there, I know, you know, John Wylie Price,|sd|2205|1
B|I don't know if you kept up,|qy^d|2205|1
B|but he's been protesting,|sd|2205|1
A|Yes|ny|2205|0
A|I have|sd|2205|0
A|and, uh, I prefer you know to have a little bit of variety like that because I think you're, you're more likely to get,|sd|2205|0
B|Yeah,|b|2205|1
B|and I think he has legitimate argument.|sv|2205|1
B|I mean you can, uh,|%|2205|1
B|I, I, I grew up in Alabama|sd|2205|1
B|and so I, I have some prejudices.|sd|2205|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|2205|0
B|But I think that, I think that, that from a, a justice standpoint, because we have the option of not watching that station.|sv|2205|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|2205|0
B|Uh, I'm not sure I, I'm totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs|sv|2205|1
B|but I think that, uh, in some cases this should be some real opportunity and, and some diversity, and and this kind of thing|sv|2205|1
A|Yeah.|b|2205|0
B|and I think that, Dallas, it turns out, though from what I understand, has quite good,|sd|2205|1
B|I occasionally go to Saint Louis.|sd|2205|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|2205|0
B|And, uh, there for a few days and watch the news and, and think Dallas really does have, have quite good news.|sv|2205|1
B|I think channel eight is the number one, uh, A B C affiliate in the U S.|sd|2205|1
B|I think Tracy Rowlett was saying that he,|sd|2205|1
A|Oh, really?|bh|2205|0
B|Course he pumping his own|sd|2205|1
A|Well, we, you know,|%|2205|0
A|like all of the stations seem to be pretty good,|sv|2205|0
A|it's just we haven't found one that we've snuggled into.|sd|2205|0
B|Where'd you move from?|qw|2205|1
A|Houston.|sd|2205|0
A|So we had a, a favorite,|sd|2205|0
A|or I did, have a favorite channel that I usually tuned into for local news.|sd|2205|0
A|I guess because you get use to, you like the anchors,|sd|2205|0
B|Yeah.|b|2205|1
A|and you feel comfortable with them|sd|2205|0
A|and,|b|2205|0
B|It is interesting though,|sv|2205|1
B|it becomes a little of personality.|sv|2205|1
B|In fact, the, the guy that was on, the weatherman on channel eight worked for me, oh, long time ago, twenty years or so, even longer than that. Twenty-one, twenty-three years ago or so, twenty-four, anyway long time ago|sv|2205|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|2205|0
B|and, and shortly after I got, we got here fourteen years ago|sd|2205|1
B|and, uh, they had, they had fired him, uh, because he was too|sd|2205|1
B|anyway, didn't, he didn't have the personality, and wasn't drawing the crowds|sd|2205|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|2205|0
B|and that's interesting.|sv|2205|1
B|That's, that's what the T V stations do.|sv|2205|1
B|they're trying to get ratings.|sv|2205|1
A|That's true.|ba|2205|0
B|And I think, if we remember that, that they're out after the ratings.|sv|2205|1
A|Their job.|^2|2205|0
A|That's true.|ba|2205|0
A|So that really effects how they report the news.|sv|2205|0
B|Well, it's like the, the Dale Hansen on channel eight is a, sometimes a little too cutesy|sd|2205|1
B|but, I wonder if we're coming up on ten minutes.|sd|2205|1
A|Is he the sports,|qy|2205|0
B|Have you talked, have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes?|qy|2205|1
A|Yeah,|b|2205|0
A|I guess it is time to close now, so I can run go help put the kids to bed.|ad|2205|0
B|Okay,|aa|2205|1
B|well good talking to you.|fc|2205|1
A|Yeah.|fc|2205|0
B|Goodnight.|fc|2205|1
A|Bye-bye.|fc|2205|0
