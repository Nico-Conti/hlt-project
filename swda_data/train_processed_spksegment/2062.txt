A|Well, what do you think in terms of, uh, benefits?|qo|2062|0
B|Well, personally, you know, I think, you know,|%|2062|1
B|of course I'm sure we're familiar with the exact same benefit package|sv|2062|1
B|and I think that, uh, we've probably got one of the best around, you know,|sv|2062|1
B|besides, they tend to offer adequate vacation, I guess.|sv|2062|1
B|And the paid time off is wonderful,|sv|2062|1
B|and, uh, one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the CODA Plan that is offered|sd|2062|1
B|and I think that is just a, a fabulous one,|sv|2062|1
B|so. I don't know if you participate in that or not,|qy^d|2062|1
B|but|%|2062|1
A|Absolutely.|ny|2062|0
B|isn't it great?|qy|2062|1
B|It's just a, it's just a miracle that how fast that adds up, you know.|sv|2062|1
A|Well, I have to agree with that.|aa|2062|0
A|You know, I was thinking about, uh, importance of benefits and that kind of thing, other than salary while I was waiting for, uh, the system to find a, a respondent.|sd|2062|0
B|Uh-huh|b|2062|1
B|Uh-huh.|b|2062|1
A|And I started thinking that over the years that importance has changed|sd|2062|0
A|and I suspect that that's probably true for everyone.|sv|2062|0
B|Yeah.|b|2062|1
A|When I was much younger it was, uh, less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits.|sd|2062|0
A|But as I grow older and my family grows, it, the medical benefits are more important|sd|2062|0
A|and the retirement is more important.|sd|2062|0
B|I had never really thought of it that way|ba|2062|1
B|but I guess that's true, I guess that's true.|aa|2062|1
B|I'm still young enough that, that, uh, the vacation's real important to me|sd|2062|1
B|and the paid time off is real important to me and, and that kind of thing.|sd|2062|1
B|But, uh, you know, I was just, as a matter of fact, I just, uh, celebrated my fifth year at T I the end of last month and, uh, kind of started looking through the, the book because of that, you know,|sd|2062|1
B|now that I'm a hundred percent vested, you know, you kind of look through the book and see well, what exactly, what does that mean and what is the pension all about|sd|2062|1
B|and, you know, when you're, when you're, you know, in your,|%|2062|1
B|I'm only in my late twenties now,|sd|2062|1
B|so you tend not to think about retirement.|sd|2062|1
B|But, uh, it's,|%|2062|1
B|I guess now is the time to think about it,|sd|2062|1
B|so. Does T I have a pretty good retirement package, do you think?|qy|2062|1
A|I think they have, uh, one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves.|na|2062|0
B|Yeah.|b|2062|1
A|And that's certainly one of the reasons that I'm sure that they've begun the, uh, CODA Plan.|sd|2062|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2062|1
A|It's certainly a, a supplemental way, uh,|sd|2062|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2062|1
A|and I suppose if, maybe in, in your instance, if, if you're started with T I in your early to mid-twenties, and happen to stay with them until you're sixty-five, then you'll have a very good retirement plan.|sv|2062|0
B|Right.|b|2062|1
A|But I had another career first and then came to T I a little later.|sd|2062|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2062|1
A|So it's not, uh,|%|2062|0
A|all by itself it won't be adequate for, for my situation.|sd|2062|0
B|It's not going to build up, quite enough,|sd|2062|1
B|yeah.|aa|2062|1
A|So, I have to find a way to supplement that.|sd|2062|0
B|Yeah.|b|2062|1
B|Well, they just, they seem to make it so easy to save.|sv|2062|1
B|You know, one of the things that we're doing which is probably the worst investment in the world,|%|2062|1
B|but I've got money coming out to buy savings bonds, just coming straight out of my check.|sd|2062|1
B|And it's probably not a great investment,|sv|2062|1
B|but if I wasn't doing that the money wouldn't be being saved anyway, you know.|sd|2062|1
B|I kind of have to trade off, you know.|sd|2062|1
B|If you never see it you don't spend it,|sv|2062|1
B|so And it's,|%|2062|1
A|I understand though,|ba|2062|0
A|it,|%|2062|0
B|Yeah.|b|2062|1
A|Uh, believe me, I do that myself.|sd|2062|0
B|Do you?|bh|2062|1
B|Yeah?|bh|2062|1
A|And I disagree with you.|ar|2062|0
A|I don't think it's the worst investment, in the world.|sd|2062|0
B|Do you really not?|bh|2062|1
B|I, I, you know, I, I debate about whether it's really good or not, you know.|sd|2062|1
A|Well, it's, in terms of guaranteed return on investment|%|2062|0
A|and maybe you don't start looking for that word guaranteed, until later.|sd|2062|0
B|Yeah.|b|2062|1
B|Yeah.|b|2062|1
A|Uh, it's shown a history that, uh, sure beats anything else. Over many, many years.|sv|2062|0
B|Yeah,|aa|2062|1
B|that's true.|aa|2062|1
B|That's very true.|aa|2062|1
B|We went, uh, and did a, a thing through I B S which is a, like a financial consultant type thing here in Dallas|sd|2062|1
B|and, uh, one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was, you know,|sd|2062|1
B|they work up this whole big, you know, proposal, profile for you, that, all the things that you need to work on and you need to do.|sd|2062|1
B|And then one of the things that we talked about with her was, you know, the need to save for our son's education.|sd|2062|1
B|We have a two year old, you know,|sd|2062|1
B|and, and, you know, we can't start saving for college when he's sixteen, you know,|sd|2062|1
B|we have to do that now.|sd|2062|1
B|And, and uh, they have a way that they can figure, you know, what, you know,|sd|2062|1
B|and he's two now,|sd|2062|1
B|in sixteen years when he's ready to go to college, this is how much it'll cost, you know,|sd|2062|1
B|and it's just really scary the thought of how much it's going to,|sd|2062|1
B|it's, what it costs now is ridiculous,|sd|2062|1
B|what it's going to cost sixteen years from now is just really scary.|sd|2062|1
B|And they sat down and figured up that we needed to save like between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a, oh, you know, six percent interest rate, to be able to have, you know, money for his college.|sd|2062|1
B|And that's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds, is, is, you know, about fifteen hundred dollars a year.|sd|2062|1
B|So, I guess it, you know,|%|2062|1
B|in that way, at least we know that that's taken care of, you know.|sd|2062|1
B|We, we can worry about other things|sd|2062|1
B|so,|%|2062|1
A|I understand, that approach.|ba|2062|0
B|Yeah.|b|2062|1
A|That's, what, that's exactly what's happening in my family.|sd|2062|0
B|Yeah,|b|2062|1
B|Is it really?|bh|2062|1
B|Yeah.|b|2062|1
A|except that mine are a little bit older|sd|2062|0
A|and, and I've shown them the numbers and said this is what's going to be available,|sd|2062|0
A|all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you're there.|^q|2062|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2062|1
A|You better make sure that you've got a scholarship.|^q|2062|0
B|That's right.|aa|2062|1
B|That's right.|aa|2062|1
B|Well, that's what she said to us.|sd|2062|1
B|She said, now, do you all want him to go to a, a state college or a private college?|sd|2062|1
B|And, and our answer was, that, you know, we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college.|sd|2062|1
B|And if he wants to go to a private college, he can get a scholarship to attend, you know.|sd|2062|1
B|And that was kind of our view on it.|sd|2062|1
B|It just costs too much,|sv|2062|1
B|you just can't do it, you know.|sv|2062|1
B|So, I don't know,|h|2062|1
B|it's, it's,|%|2062|1
B|I don't, uh,|%|2062|1
B|it just amazing,|%|2062|1
B|it amazes me how much the, the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years.|sd|2062|1
B|I just don't know how anybody's going to do it.|sv|2062|1
A|And boy, it gets really scary when you start talking to them.|sd|2062|0
A|Uh, I have a, an eleven year old daughter now who's saying, gee, Dad, I want to be an allergist,|sd|2062|0
B|Oh, goodness.|ba|2062|1
A|and I said, that's wonderful.|sd|2062|0
A|I applaud that.|^q|2062|0
A|Let, me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that.|^q|2062|0
B|Yeah.|b|2062|1
B|Yeah.|b|2062|1
B|Exactly.|ba|2062|1
A|And, then her little brother's only two years behind|sd|2062|0
B|Exactly.|ba|2062|1
A|and he says, well, I don't know,|sd|2062|0
A|I think that I probably want to be a veterinarian.|^q|2062|0
A|And I said, that's great.|sd|2062|0
A|Let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that.|^q|2062|0
B|That's right,|aa|2062|1
B|That's right|aa|2062|1
B|Well, you know, T I, you know, T I offers some good stuff|sv|2062|1
B|and then I think there's, I mean I think there's some negatives,|sv|2062|1
B|but there's going to be some negatives anywhere, you know, no matter where you go.|sv|2062|1
B|I have, you know, all,|%|2062|1
B|this is the first really large company I've worked for. I've|sd|2062|1
B|always been involved in little small, you know, privately owned owned firms|sd|2062|1
B|and so I've never had the, the big benefit package.|sd|2062|1
B|So, I really don't know how to compare it to other big companies, you know.|sd|2062|1
B|It, when I came on it was great because I had never had anything even close to what, what they offered.|sd|2062|1
B|So, I've been real pleased.|sd|2062|1
A|Well, that's fantastic,|ba|2062|0
B|Yeah.|b|2062|1
A|and on whole I would say that they're equal to, uh, most of our competitors.|sv|2062|0
B|Think so?|bh|2062|1
A|Uh, I can see some, some potential changes that probably are, are, would not cost very much but might, uh, make things a little easier. Such as offering a, a smorgasbord. Having a larger variety of benefits|sv|2062|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2062|1
A|but, but here's the amount, that, that T I is going to pay for it,|sv|2062|0
B|Yeah.|b|2062|1
B|Yeah,|aa|2062|1
B|and you can pick what you want|sv|2062|1
B|and, yeah.|aa|2062|1
A|now it's up to you|ad|2062|0
A|it's menu selection, so, to speak.|sv|2062|0
B|Right.|b|2062|1
B|That sounds really good.|ba|2062|1
B|I read a thing,|sd|2062|1
B|I don't even remember if it was in the DALLASITE or the INSITE one, about uh, companies allowing you,|sd|2062|1
B|and they said that T I was looking into it, to purchase extra vacation days. Which I thought sounded like a good idea.|sd|2062|1
B|You know, if you've been there, you know, under five years and you get two weeks of vacation|sd|2062|1
B|but that's really not enough|sv|2062|1
B|and you want an extra week, then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying, okay, I'm going to want an extra five days this year|sd|2062|1
B|and they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck, you know,|sd|2062|1
B|and they're deducting it all along,|sd|2062|1
B|so you, you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time, you know,|sd|2062|1
B|you're really not being paid for them,|sd|2062|1
B|the money is actually coming out of your own pocket,|sd|2062|1
B|but it's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once, you know.|sd|2062|1
B|So, that is kind of an idea that, that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in|sd|2062|1
B|and T I said that they were looking into something like that|sd|2062|1
B|so,|%|2062|1
A|Well, I could certainly, personally stand seeing them go to a, a standardized compensatory time for overtime.|sv|2062|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2062|1
B|Uh-huh.|b|2062|1
A|And I don't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days, if they did, that.|sv|2062|0
B|Well,|%|2062|1
B|true.|aa|2062|1
B|True.|aa|2062|1
A|Uh, and, and I would certainly support something like four to one or five to one|sv|2062|0
A|or, or, you know, maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one. Uh, as a repayment for, every three to five days that I work overtime there, they should give me one day.|sv|2062|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2062|1
B|Yeah.|b|2062|1
B|Yeah.|b|2062|1
B|Yeah.|b|2062|1
A|But it should be a standard and, and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate uh, that's running in each department.|sv|2062|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2062|1
B|Well,|%|2062|1
B|and, yeah,|%|2062|1
B|and, and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person|sd|2062|1
B|and, you know, I see a lot of differences, but, from one group to the next, you know, about who gets it and who doesn't get it, you know.|sd|2062|1
B|But that's, and that's that way with a lot of things, you know, there.|sd|2062|1
B|It seems like, it depends on what, what group you happen to be in, what, what you're going to get and what you're not going to get|sv|2062|1
B|so,|%|2062|1
A|Well, that's for sure.|aa|2062|0
B|Which is the same,|sv|2062|1
B|but, but then it's probably that way anywhere, you know,|sv|2062|1
B|that's,|%|2062|1
A|Oh, I'm sure personalities always come into play.|sv|2062|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2062|1
A|Uh, just in this size of organization,|%|2062|0
