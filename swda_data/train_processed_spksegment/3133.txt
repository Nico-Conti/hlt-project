B|Okay.|fo_o_fw_"_by_bc|3133|0
A|Um, well I guess first of all I, I could have asked that before.|sv|3133|1
A|Do you have children?|qy|3133|1
B|No.|nn|3133|0
A|No.|b^m|3133|1
A|Okay.|bk|3133|1
A|Because I, I didn't know if that would make a difference  in how you felt.|sd|3133|1
B|Yeah.|b|3133|0
A|Um, what do you think about the proposal that all young Americans should spend a year or two,|qo|3133|1
B|I think it's a good idea.|sv|3133|0
B|I think everybody should, should, uh, put in their time so to speak for the, for the good of the, the nation and for the good of themselves.|sv|3133|0
A|Yeah.|b|3133|1
B|I think it's, uh,|sv|3133|0
B|would everyone grow up and mature and, and realize what this country's all about.|sv|3133|0
A|I just, um,|%|3133|1
A|I guess that's my, that's something that my family has always believed strongly in,|sd|3133|1
A|and, uh, I had opportunities in high school, to work in some programs, um|sd|3133|1
B|Did you?|qy|3133|0
B|something Oh!|ba|3133|0
A|and, and I agree with what you said that it's, uh, it benefits the person doing it  so much I don't think they realize|sd|3133|1
B|Uh-huh.|b|3133|0
A|and I, uh, I, I think it gives you a better perspective, on life|sv|3133|1
A|and, uh, it gives you a little bit, uh, more a glimpse of the, the real world|sv|3133|1
A|and  and it would certainly help the country, too, uh.|sv|3133|1
B|Yeah.|b|3133|0
B|Really|b|3133|0
B|Yeah,|%|3133|0
B|I think that's probably like, uh, quite a few things that, that the kids, uh, maybe not so much nowadays but used to  go through, you know,|sv|3133|0
A|Yeah.|b|3133|1
B|they, just, they were, they did things for people, you know, for their communities, for their, their, uh, families, for their friends, where now, I'm not sure they really do.|sv|3133|0
A|Yes.|aa|3133|1
A|Yeah.|aa|3133|1
A|Well, I think sometimes through groups and organizations, um,|sv|3133|1
A|my first, when I first thought of it, I thought it, uh, when they asked the question I thought, well that sounds wonderful.|sd|3133|1
A|And then, I wondered if people were unwilling|sd|3133|1
A|but, but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long.|sv|3133|1
A|Um, but I do know through some organized groups like Scouts and church um, they, do still have opportunities.|sd|3133|1
B|Uh-huh.|b|3133|0
B|Yeah,|aa|3133|0
B|that's probably true  You know|aa|3133|0
A|But, I, I think that's a small, uh, number could,|sv|3133|1
B|but even, even through those groups, do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to?|qy|3133|0
A|No,|nn|3133|1
A|um, not since, um, not as much as I remember growing up.|sd|3133|1
A|And that was something, uh, I think in the fifties and sixties, um, seemed more common in the last two decades.|sv|3133|1
B|Uh-huh.|b|3133|0
B|Yeah.|aa|3133|0
B|I think that's probably true.|aa|3133|0
A|But,|%|3133|1
B|I think it's probably more true, still in the, in the smaller communities then in the larger cities.|sv|3133|0
A|Yeah.|b|3133|1
A|Yeah.|b|3133|1
A|Where, uh, where abouts do you live?|qw|3133|1
A|What part of the country?|qw|3133|1
B|Well, I live in Richardson right now. Which is just,|sd|3133|0
A|Oh, okay.|bk|3133|1
A|We're in Plano|sd|3133|1
A|so we're not far apart.|sd|3133|1
B|Right.|aa|3133|0
B|Yeah,|aa|3133|0
B|okay.|aa|3133|0
A|One of the calls I'd gotten before was, uh, down to Austin|sd|3133|1
A|and, and I know, a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest|sd|3133|1
A|so I know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area.|sd|3133|1
B|Yeah.|b|3133|0
B|Gosh,|ba|3133|0
B|I hadn't even thought about it being out of the area|sd|3133|0
B|but you're right.|sv|3133|0
B|Yeah.|%|3133|0
B|I grew up in a real small town in Florida.|sd|3133|0
A|Oh.|b|3133|1
B|I mean a real small town|sd|3133|0
B|And, uh, I think it was just|sv|3133|0
B|of course it was back in the, in the fifties|sd|3133|0
B|and I think it was real prevalent back then.|sv|3133|0
B|I I think people thought more of others than they do now. You know, as far as doing things for them and, and then gaining benefits from it.|sv|3133|0
A|Yeah.|b|3133|1
A|Well,|%|3133|1
A|and maybe, uh, maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back. Um, if we've lost some of that|sv|3133|1
A|and it, it seems in the last decade or two, um, that's true,|sv|3133|1
A|maybe that's a way,|sv|3133|1
A|if, if young people had to do it um, maybe that would start the trend back because that's one of the things I always thought was a wonderful part of our country. Um,  is helping others|sv|3133|1
B|Uh-huh.|b|3133|0
B|Yeah,|aa|3133|0
B|I do to.|aa|3133|0
B|I do to.|aa|3133|0
B|I'm not sure that, that today's kids would go for it though.|sv|3133|0
B|I think you would have to start younger.|sv|3133|0
A|Yeah.|b|3133|1
B|I, I don't know how young you'd have to go|sd|3133|0
B|but I think by the time they're, oh, early teenagers anyway, I think it's too late now. At least around here.|sv|3133|0
A|Yeah,|b|3133|1
A|I think, uh, I think it does help, um, even preschoolers, you know|sv|3133|1
A|they're, um, things even just starting around the home.  You know|sv|3133|1
B|Right.|b|3133|0
A|little ones can do a little bit to help the family.|sv|3133|1
B|Uh-huh.|b|3133|0
A|And, and just watching the parents do things too, um, it can start a pattern.|sv|3133|1
A|There's always something, no matter how young,|sv|3133|1
A|and then that helps develop that attitude.|sv|3133|1
A|Um, I guess I would really like to see this happen with families more.|sd|3133|1
A|You know, I think this is certainly a possible way, um, to handle it|sv|3133|1
A|but I wish,|sd|3133|1
A|that's something that I think that has been lost in families|sv|3133|1
A|and I think that's a good place to start again.|sv|3133|1
B|Yeah.|b|3133|0
B|I think it has to start in the families first because if you don't do it for, for your own immediate family, you're sure not going to do it for anybody else.|sv|3133|0
A|Yeah.|b|3133|1
A|And I do think, um, the schools,|sv|3133|1
A|if you're trying to do something, even with food drives|sd|3133|1
A|and, uh, sometimes what Richardson and Plano both,|sd|3133|1
A|I mean when you live in areas like that where there's so much they don't realize what a small percentage of the world that is.|sv|3133|1
B|Uh-huh.|b|3133|0
A|I mean, that's, uh,|%|3133|1
A|gosh I'm sure, not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas|sv|3133|1
A|and, uh  it's,|%|3133|1
B|That's probably true.|sv|3133|0
B|That's probably true.|sv|3133|0
A|I know our church youth group, uh, starts with projects young|sd|3133|1
A|but they have a high school group that works in the Appalachia  area every year.|sd|3133|1
B|Uh-huh.|b|3133|0
A|They've done this for fourteen years now.|sd|3133|1
B|Oh, that's great.|ba|3133|0
A|Um, and it is, it's, uh,|%|3133|1
A|and they've also see that there's, there's a different way of life and those families are really close.|sd|3133|1
A|Some of the things, that we talked about that were common in the fifties are still there|sd|3133|1
B|Uh-huh.|b|3133|0
A|and, uh, it really,|%|3133|1
A|every youth that's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed|sd|3133|1
A|and it's changed their perspective.|sd|3133|1
A|And, and that's just the two weeks during, during the summer.|sd|3133|1
B|Uh-huh.|b|3133|0
A|So, if two weeks, uh, could have that kind of effect I would  think, uh,|sv|3133|1
B|Well, that's, that's great.|ba|3133|0
B|I'm glad that there are still some areas that, that get the youth involved in that sort of thing.|sd|3133|0
A|Well that's,|%|3133|1
B|Like I said, I think it does,|sv|3133|0
B|even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference  in their attitudes|sv|3133|0
A|Yes.|b|3133|1
B|Well|%|3133|0
A|Well, I guess, um,|%|3133|1
A|did you have anything else?|qy|3133|1
B|No,|nn|3133|0
B|no|nn|3133|0
B|I guess that's about all.|sd|3133|0
A|Okay.|b|3133|1
B|Okay.|b^m|3133|0
A|Well, I enjoyed talking with you.|fc|3133|1
B|Well, good talking with you.|fc|3133|0
