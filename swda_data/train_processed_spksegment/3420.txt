A|Hello,|fp|3420|0
A|my name is Donna,|fp|3420|0
A|and I'm calling from Plano, Texas.|fp|3420|0
B|Hi,|fp|3420|1
B|this is Laurie,|fp|3420|1
B|and I'm in Garland|fp|3420|1
A|Oh, okay.|b|3420|0
A|Um, would you like me to go first?|qy|3420|0
B|Sure.|na|3420|1
A|Okay, um|bk|3420|0
A|I have three children, um, two, two who are in regular school, uh, eleven year old, an eight year old,|sd|3420|0
A|and then my little one, three year old, is in, um, a University of Gymnastics,|sd|3420|0
A|it's a, a preschool|sd|3420|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|3420|1
A|and, um, I think it was really hard to, um, to pick the right, uh, day care or preschool or Mother's Day Out.|sd|3420|0
A|I guess you can classify them all together.|sv|3420|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|3420|1
A|Um, some of the qualifications that I look for was that, uh, you know, the cost, and, um, exactly what they did, if it was structured or nonstructured, if they had a little academic, um, uh, in there, and, um, you know, um, you know, what the qualifications of the teachers' were, and if the place was clean and um, the hours|sd|3420|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|3420|1
A|and, um, just, just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program that kind of stuff.|sd|3420|0
B|Right.|b|3420|1
B|Well, we don't have any children,|sd|3420|1
B|but we're going to have one next year|sd|3420|1
A|Oh, congratulations.|ba|3420|0
B|Thanks.|ft|3420|1
B|So, um, that's something that I'm probably going to be looking at maybe in the future.|sd|3420|1
A|Right.|b|3420|0
B|We haven't quite decided if I'm going to,|sd|3420|1
B|I'm working part time now,|sd|3420|1
B|and I don't know if I'll be doing that or what we're going to do.|sd|3420|1
A|Or staying home.|qy^d|3420|0
B|But if we do, then I'm going to need to find somebody,|sd|3420|1
B|and our church has a Mother's Day Out program which they started last year,|sd|3420|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|3420|0
B|and we know a lot of people at the church|sd|3420|1
B|so I would feel very confident with leaving my child there|sd|3420|1
A|That's a very good place to start I think.|sv|3420|0
A|Uh-huh.|aa|3420|0
A|Yeah,|aa|3420|0
A|the Mother's Day Out programs,|sd|3420|0
A|and that's where Shannon had started, in a Mother's Day Out program|sd|3420|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|3420|1
A|and, uh, the churches always have I think, a, a pretty good program,|sv|3420|0
A|and you have to make sure that you, um, that you apply pretty early, because they do have, a lot of places have very long waiting lists.|ad|3420|0
B|Uh-huh.|aa|3420|1
A|And, um, and another question to ask is if they're, um, state certified um, you know, if the teachers have, um, their Master's degree in, in child education and um, child development.|ad|3420|0
B|Okay.|aa|3420|1
B|Uh-huh|aa|3420|1
A|Um, you know, what, what kind of a structure is it going to be.|qh|3420|0
A|Um, when your child's a little bit older, like a three year old you'd be more concerned with if there's a type of care that it's torture for them to lay down and take a nap.|sv|3420|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|3420|1
A|Is there like a mandatory nap time?|qh|3420|0
B|Time, uh-huh.|b|3420|1
A|What they do at Shannon's school is have a video tape going,|sd|3420|0
A|and if, and they lay on these little mats,|sd|3420|0
A|and if they fall asleep, they kind of let them sleep,|sd|3420|0
A|and the teacher stays with the sleeping ones,|sd|3420|0
A|and the other ones get up and go do something else.|sd|3420|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|3420|1
A|So, she doesn't have to necessary take a nap there you know, which is, which is nice. Um.|sd|3420|0
B|Right.|b|3420|1
B|Uh-huh.|b|3420|1
B|Um, you know, it's kind of scary, I guess, because you hear so many bad things about day cares lately,|sd|3420|1
A|That's true.|aa|3420|0
B|and so, it's, I guess it's such a growing concern,|sv|3420|1
B|but then there's a lot of good things you don't hear.|sv|3420|1
A|Right.|aa|3420|0
A|And sometimes when the child's a lot younger, before they're really, um, before three years old, you know, like the church is a good program|sv|3420|0
A|and sometimes you even consider, um, you know, having a private person come to your own home when they're real little or or something like that,|sv|3420|0
B|Right.|b|3420|1
A|and another consideration is how many infants or children are they, what's the ratio of, of teachers to to children|qh|3420|0
B|To children.|^2|3420|1
B|Right.|b|3420|1
A|because that makes, a, a, a difference,|sv|3420|0
A|and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day,|qh|3420|0
A|just your child, and, or do they just put any child in any crib you know,|qh|3420|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|3420|1
A|you would want, maybe, your child to have their own sheets all the time, and not have another child use that bed you know.|sv|3420|0
B|Right.|b|3420|1
B|Right.|b|3420|1
A|I'm sure that, um, whatever you decide, you'll be happy with.|sv|3420|0
B|Yeah|b|3420|1
A|And it's exciting time to have a new one|sv|3420|0
B|Yeah.|aa|3420|1
B|We're pretty excited.|sd|3420|1
A|I bet.|ba|3420|0
A|That's, that's wonderful.|ba|3420|0
B|Yeah,|aa|3420|1
B|but that, you know, we have been thinking about that,|sd|3420|1
B|but it's a little ways off in the future|sd|3420|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|3420|0
B|but, um, I figure, you know, I'd probably start asking around at church because I know they have a limit as to how old they can be before they, you know, before you can bring them in.|sd|3420|1
A|Asking.|b^m|3420|0
A|Right.|b|3420|0
A|Some, some places, um, start them as early as, I think, well, some, some places take them as infants, I guess, you know, like eight weeks, even.|sd|3420|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|3420|1
A|Um, there's a place to look into, um, um,|ad|3420|0
A|a friend of mine who's a nurse is, was telling about a wonderful new place that opened some place in, on Fifteenth Street,|sd|3420|0
A|up,|%|3420|0
A|it's in Plano somewhere where, um,|sd|3420|0
A|nurses that used to work in the hospital take care of infants, infants and then only up to like two years old|sd|3420|0
B|Um.|b|3420|1
A|and it's, it's supposed to be really a, a,|sd|3420|0
A|you know, some places just specialize in just real little ones|sd|3420|0
B|Right.|b|3420|1
A|and then other ones, uh, are the older children.|sd|3420|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|3420|1
A|But it is a difficult situation, I think.|sv|3420|0
A|When they're, when they're little it's almost easier to leave them because when they're three and they're cry,|sv|3420|0
