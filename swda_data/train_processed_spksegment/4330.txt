A|Well, uh, does the company you work for test for drugs?|qy|4330|0
B|Actually, uh, they just recently started a policy of testing drugs, which was kind of interesting,|na|4330|1
B|because when I went to work for them, uh, they didn't do that,|sd|4330|1
B|but, uh, since then they've, they've started a drug testing policy, not because of their own, uh, convictions, but because the clients of our company are requests that we do that.|sd|4330|1
A|Huh.|%|4330|0
B|How about you?|qo|4330|1
A|Uh, no,|nn|4330|0
A|we're not being tested for drugs at all, uh,|sd|4330|0
A|our policies and procedures manual, uh, the furthest it goes about drugs is in the, kind of the miscellaneous section, or it's reasons for immediate dismissal,|sd|4330|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|4330|1
A|it says, use of narcotics on company premises.|sd|4330|0
B|Um.|%|4330|1
A|So that's pretty general,|sv|4330|0
A|but, uh, I work for an environmental management firm|sd|4330|0
B|Okay.|b|4330|1
A|and I'm an engineer there,|sd|4330|0
A|but I do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites,|sd|4330|0
A|but I don't operate any machinery.|sd|4330|0
B|Yeah.|b|4330|1
A|Now, people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that are under a, a medical monitoring program,|sd|4330|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|4330|1
A|because they're at a higher risk of exposure|sd|4330|0
A|and blood screening is part of that|sd|4330|0
A|and I, I think that drugs,|sd|4330|0
A|they do test for drugs in that capacity,|sd|4330|0
A|but it's not their exclusive,|sd|4330|0
A|it's just part, it's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for.|sd|4330|0
B|Yeah.|b|4330|1
A|But I think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field.|sv|4330|0
A|What is the nature of your company's business?|qw|4330|0
B|Well, it's actually, uh,|^h|4330|1
B|we do oil well services.|sd|4330|1
B|So, a lot of our clients are oil companies, big oil companies,|sd|4330|1
B|and they go out to,|sd|4330|1
B|we have engineers who, uh, go out to the oil well, to the, to the client's oil well, and, and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff,|sd|4330|1
B|so the clients are very concerned that, you know, the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy, because they're on their, their, you know, territory and everything,|sd|4330|1
B|but the thing that's interesting is that I I'm an engineer and, a software engineer|sv|4330|1
A|Um.|%|4330|0
B|and I work in the software, uh, house,|sd|4330|1
B|and everybody there, you know, are all software engineers.|sd|4330|1
B|They've never, you know, they never go out to the, the oil rigs or anything,|sd|4330|1
B|and yet, we're getting, we're subjected to this policy, you know, the same one that, uh, all the engineers have to, to,|sd|4330|1
B|well, a little different, actually,|h|4330|1
B|but, uh, you know, we have to go through the same thing,|sd|4330|1
B|and it's, but it's, uh, it's a little different, I guess than than a lot of drug policies.|sv|4330|1
B|In our case, it's like, when you hire on, they'll test you,|sd|4330|1
B|and then if you get injured on the job, if you like trip and fall or something, uh, they give you a drug test right away.|sd|4330|1
A|Oh, really?|bh|4330|0
B|Other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that,|sd|4330|1
B|but, a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first.|sd|4330|1
B|Particularly, like uh, we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol,|sd|4330|1
B|and they didn't find any problem with that, you know,|sd|4330|1
B|but,|%|4330|1
A|Right.|aa|4330|0
B|Uh,|%|4330|1
A|We, that's been an, a, an issue, uh, in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening.|sd|4330|0
A|they'll have these little parties,|sd|4330|0
A|and people will just get,|sd|4330|0
A|I mean, I've,|%|4330|0
A|my brother lives where I work,|sd|4330|0
A|and I have many a time called him to come get me, you know.|sd|4330|0
A|And, uh, uh, but, you know, they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg. You know,|sd|4330|0
B|Yeah|b|4330|1
A|but, uh, I think drug testing,|sv|4330|0
A|and I, I don't know,|h|4330|0
A|I guess I I think it's got some relevance,|sv|4330|0
A|but I think its relevance is pretty limited.|sv|4330|0
A|I mean, I think, you know,|sv|4330|0
A|in your case, I don't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing.|sv|4330|0
B|Yeah.|b|4330|1
A|I think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident.|sv|4330|0
B|Yeah,|b|4330|1
B|it's really, it's really bizarre.|sv|4330|1
B|Uh, particularly, like where we are, you know.|sd|4330|1
B|I, I,|%|4330|1
B|there was a story of a woman last year who, who actually did slip on the ice and, and like sprained her ankle|sd|4330|1
B|and she, she was a personnel secretary|sd|4330|1
B|and she had to get tested|sd|4330|1
B|and, I don't know|h|4330|1
B|I'm ambivalent about the whole thing.|sd|4330|1
B|I, you know, I have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand, it's like if, you know,|sd|4330|1
B|they're, they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense|sv|4330|1
B|and, you know, it's like you're, I mean, employments are contractual by nature anyway|sd|4330|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|4330|0
B|but, uh, I had an experience when I was interviewing for a job that, where I had to, uh, uh, do a drug test|sd|4330|1
B|and, and it's, it was kind of a long story,|sd|4330|1
B|but it was, it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what I went through,|sv|4330|1
B|and it amounted to, uh, going in, uh, before any of these interviews,|sd|4330|1
B|I'm not even working for this company,|sd|4330|1
B|I'm going in for, like, interviews|sd|4330|1
B|and they flew me out to Chicago|sd|4330|1
B|and, and, uh, before I went into any of the interviews, uh, they took me to the doctor to give me a physical.|sd|4330|1
B|They said it was going to be a physical, you know,|sd|4330|1
B|and, uh, actually beforehand they told me they were going to, uh, do drug screening,|sd|4330|1
B|but I had forgotten about that,|sd|4330|1
B|and so, basically, I'd already peed off that morning|sd|4330|1
B|and, and when I got in there, I didn't, I wasn't, like, able to give a full sample,|sd|4330|1
B|and so they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes, drink a whole ton of water before I went to any of the interviews and go in there again,|sd|4330|1
A|Oh.|b|4330|0
A|Right.|b|4330|0
B|and the, and the, the procedure is utterly humiliating.|sv|4330|1
B|You go in there with the doctor,|sd|4330|1
B|he makes you take off all your clothes|sd|4330|1
B|and then he examines you.|sd|4330|1
