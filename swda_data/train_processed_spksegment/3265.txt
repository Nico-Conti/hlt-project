A|Well, I've been real, um, thinking I'd love to buy a new car, right now, if I could afford it.|sd|3265|0
B|Oh|b|3265|1
A|But we have two cars right now|sd|3265|0
A|and we're still paying on them,|sd|3265|0
A|but I would love to have one of these new mini vans.|sd|3265|0
A|I've got two little ones|sd|3265|0
A|and I think that would be just the perfect family car|sd|3265|0
B|I,|%|3265|1
B|right now my car is terminally ill|sd|3265|1
A|Oh|b|3265|0
B|so I am really looking at, uh, facing the purchase of a car.|sd|3265|1
B|And,|%|3265|1
B|uh, what I would like to have is so totally impractical for me that, I won't do it.|sd|3265|1
B|But|%|3265|1
A|What is it?|qw|3265|0
B|Uh, well, I would like for one time in my life to have a convertible.|sd|3265|1
A|Oh.|b|3265|0
B|And, uh, you know, I don't even like the wind blowing in on me|sd|3265|1
B|so I don't know why I think I want one|sd|3265|1
B|but I do.|sd|3265|1
B|Uh, I will probably stay with a foreign make.|sd|3265|1
B|I've had real good luck with them.|sd|3265|1
A|Yeah.|b|3265|0
A|We have, um, we have,|%|3265|0
A|we went out to buy an American car|sd|3265|0
A|so we bought, um, a Chevy Nova about three years ago.|sd|3265|0
A|And, and we opened up the, the hood|sd|3265|0
A|and it said Toyota, made in Japan, right across the front of all the engine parts|sd|3265|0
B|Is that right?|bh|3265|1
A|Uh-huh.|ny|3265|0
A|Toyota, uh,|sd|3265|0
A|well, the Chevy Nova is the same car as the Toyota Camry.|sd|3265|0
A|Uh, at that time was the same car|sd|3265|0
A|so they just put different names on them depending on who they're being shipped to.|sd|3265|0
B|Oh,|b|3265|1
A|I thought that was pretty|%|3265|0
B|well, I didn't realize it.|sd|3265|1
B|I knew that one of the, that Nissan which is Toyota had, uh, joined with, had a plant over here.|sd|3265|1
B|but I, I never thought of,|sd|3265|1
A|Yeah.|b|3265|0
B|I know, uh,|ba|3265|1
B|you think it's a Chevrolet in the good old U S A.|sv|3265|1
A|Uh-huh,|b|3265|0
A|uh-huh.|b|3265|0
A|That's why we were so surprised to see Toyota written, I mean, imprinted on the engine.|sd|3265|0
A|It was real interesting.|sd|3265|0
B|Huh.|b|3265|1
A|But, uh, I,|%|3265|0
A|with so many options now available, you know, where, where cars are concerned, it just seems like there is, there's almost too much of a choice anymore.|sv|3265|0
A|You know, there's so many different options and so many different prices and who has this cash back and whatever.|sd|3265|0
A|I think that if I were really serious about looking for another car, I would take into consideration the price naturally.|sv|3265|0
A|But, um, you know, I would really want something that I would want for that much money. For ten or twelve or fifteen thousand dollars or whatever.|sv|3265|0
B|Well, yeah,|aa|3265|1
B|and that's minimum.|sv|3265|1
A|Oh,|aa|3265|0
A|definitely|aa|3265|0
B|It, you know it's, it's a major purchase, now.|sd|3265|1
B|What we used to pay for homes is now what a car, can cost.|sv|3265|1
A|I cannot imagine that, you know, somebody,|sv|3265|0
A|I heard a commercial or something about a sixty thousand dollar car about, oh, it would, how, exciting it is to make that kind of a purchase,|sd|3265|0
A|and I thought, I don't think I'd find that exciting|sv|3265|0
A|I'd be wondering, you know, here I am buying this expensive of a car and my house isn't worth that much money|sd|3265|0
B|If they held their value, that would be one thing.|sv|3265|1
A|That's true.|aa|3265|0
B|But when you consider that when you drive them off of the show lot, they're immediately two thousand dollars depreciated.|sv|3265|1
A|Yeah.|b|3265|0
B|And, you know, that,|qy|3265|1
B|I don't know that, I'll go with,|sd|3265|1
B|I've bought a new car the last three that I've bought|sd|3265|1
B|and I don't know that I'll buy a brand new one again.|sd|3265|1
A|Yeah.|b|3265|0
A|Well, we had a pretty,|sd|3265|0
A|we bought our Chevrolet brand new|sd|3265|0
A|and then we bought a used car|sd|3265|0
A|to Just a minute,|t3|3265|0
A|I'll change your diaper.|t3|3265|0
A|Then we bought our, our next car used|sd|3265|0
A|and, uh, we had better luck with our used car,|sd|3265|0
A|and I like it more.|sd|3265|0
A|It cost us less money|sd|3265|0
A|and we got more features and air-conditioning and whatever on it then we did on our brand new one for twice as much money.|sd|3265|0
B|Well, I'm, I'm seriously considering going that route instead of a brand new car.|sd|3265|1
A|If you can find one that's uh, you know, reliable|sv|3265|0
A|If you can get someone that you trust to buy one from|sv|3265|0
A|or, you know, make sure that you can have it checked out well enough|sv|3265|0
A|Uh, I wouldn't|ar|3265|0
B|and they don't drive them that much.|sv|3265|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|3265|0
A|Sh ,|%|3265|0
B|Six thousand is just getting broken in for them.|sv|3265|1
A|Yeah.|b|3265|0
B|And if I can find one or a repossession.|sd|3265|1
A|That's,|%|3265|0
A|we bought one like that.|sd|3265|0
B|And with the banks being in such financial, you know, problems now that people,|sv|3265|1
B|you can find the banks willing to sell you a car.|sv|3265|1
A|Uh-huh|b|3265|0
A|We bought one car that way|sd|3265|0
A|and had,|%|3265|0
A|we bought it real reasonably|sd|3265|0
A|and it was in real nice condition so, because apparently whatever the bank get ...|sd|3265|0
