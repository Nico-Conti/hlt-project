B|so she usually ends up doing most of it.|sd|2627|1
A|Oh, yeah.|b|2627|0

A|Oh, really.|b|2627|0
B|And my wife, she likes Italian and stuff,|sd|2627|1
A|Oh.|b|2627|0
B|so we, we definitely have different tastes,|sd|2627|1
B|so.|%|2627|1
A|Yeah,|b|2627|0
A|yeah,|b|2627|0
A|but that's neat though, because you get to have different stuff|sv|2627|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2627|1
A|Yeah,|b|2627|0
A|I'm not, I'm a pretty bad cook|sd|2627|0
A|I'm pretty bad.|sd|2627|0
A|My husband is really good,|sd|2627|0
A|he put himself through college working in restaurants.|sd|2627|0
B|Oh, wow.|ba|2627|1
A|And, uh, he's much better cook than I am,|sd|2627|0
A|so, when I was home I still cooked a lot|sd|2627|0
A|and I was in to a lot of vegetarian stuff.|sd|2627|0
A|And now, I went back to work about a year and a half ago|sd|2627|0
A|so, one of the things that he took over was the cooking|sd|2627|0
A|and the kids are thrilled,|sd|2627|0
A|they're really happy, that I don't cook anymore.|sd|2627|0
B|Uh, they're like, uh, preferring it now, right|qy|2627|1
A|Yeah,|ny|2627|0
A|they say oh dad, let dad cook mom,|sd|2627|0
A|let him do it|^q|2627|0
A|But, um, so, so do you all, do you have kids?|qy|2627|0
A|You obviously have one.|qy^d|2627|0
B|Yeah,|ny|2627|1
B|two,|sd|2627|1
B|uh-huh.|ny|2627|1
A|Okay,|bk|2627|0
A|you have two.|bf|2627|0
B|Yeah,|aa|2627|1
B|one is, uh, nine months|sd|2627|1
B|and the other is two and a half.|sd|2627|1
A|Two and half, oh.|b^m|2627|0
B|Yeah,|b|2627|1
B|that's the hard part is cooking with, uh, kids around because, uh,|%|2627|1
A|I was just going to say, makes a difference in what you eat doesn't it|qy|2627|0
A|Or are you not at that stage yet?|qrr|2627|0
B|Yeah,|ny|2627|1
B|it does|sd|2627|1
A|Yeah.|b|2627|0
B|We try our hardest to get them to eat what we, eat, you know.|sd|2627|1
A|Right.|b|2627|0
B|And my sister, uh, she's the master of the fast order grill, you know,|sd|2627|1
A|Oh, yeah.|b|2627|0
B|she can make, uh, she makes six different meals,|sd|2627|1
B|but.|%|2627|1
A|Oh my gosh.|ba|2627|0
B|Like to have one thing, you know,|sd|2627|1
B|one likes chicken nuggets, the other one like hot dogs,|sd|2627|1
A|Oh my gosh,|ba|2627|0
A|I couldn't|sd|2627|0
B|and then she makes noodles with, uh, with,  soy sauce or whatever,|sd|2627|1
A|Yeah.|b|2627|0
B|so, all things.|%|2627|1
A|Boy, I couldn't do that,|sd|2627|0
A|I|%|2627|0
B|But, um, yeah,|b|2627|1
B|our favorite,|%|2627|1
B|let me think,|^h|2627|1
B|I was thinking of the one recipe that, uh, that we made.|sd|2627|1
B|I guess the thing that always turned out the best for us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy,|sd|2627|1
B|and that was, um,  uh, scallops, uh, scallop, um,|sd|2627|1
A|What's that.|qw|2627|0
A|Oh really.|b|2627|0
B|it has a French name,|sd|2627|1
B|it basically means that it has a Swiss cheese, cream sauce with it|sd|2627|1
B|and you pour it over rice,|sd|2627|1
A|Oh yeah,|b|2627|0
A|what's, what is that, Saint Jack or something.|qy|2627|0
B|Yeah, uh.|ny|2627|1
A|Scallops Saint something,|sd|2627|0
A|or, yeah, .|%|2627|0
B|Yeah,|b|2627|1
B|I can't even remember what the recipe's name is anymore,|sd|2627|1
A|Yeah,|b|2627|0
A|yeah.|b|2627|0
B|but, uh, it was basically just ground up Swiss cheese and then, uh, standard cream sauce base and then, uh the scallops.|sd|2627|1
A|Really,|b|2627|0
A|with scallops.|^2|2627|0
B|An, and it sounds sort of funny|sv|2627|1
B|but it tastes really good.|sd|2627|1
A|No,|ar|2627|0
A|no,|ar|2627|0
A|I'm from New England,|sd|2627|0
A|so we, we had, um, a lot of seafood before we moved down here.|sd|2627|0
A|And, uh, that sounds delicious to me.|sv|2627|0
B|Yeah.|b|2627|1
A|That sounds great.|ba|2627|0
B|Yeah,|b|2627|1
B|but, uh,|%|2627|1
A|I think, we're just thinking of having, a, uh, dinner party.|sd|2627|0
A|We went to this dinner party the other night that was kind of like a game,|sd|2627|0
A|they had, uh, a murder mystery,|sd|2627|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2627|1
A|and you came dressed as one of the characters|sd|2627|0
A|and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner,|sd|2627|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2627|1
A|and it was really fun|sd|2627|0
A|and so we, we were thinking we wanted to do, you know, we were going to try doing it ourselves,|sd|2627|0
A|but we're trying to decide what can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around trying to get stuff ready for the table|sd|2627|0
A|and that kind of interrupted the game,|sd|2627|0
A|so,  so I was thinking there's this Beef Bourguignonne recipe that I've tried before that's pretty good|sd|2627|0
B|Right,|b|2627|1
B|yeah.|b|2627|1
A|and then you can make that ahead|sd|2627|0
A|and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you're ready.|sd|2627|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2627|1
A|So that's, uh,|%|2627|0
B|Yeah|b|2627|1
B|that's another thing|sd|2627|1
B|I have a problem with my wife,|sd|2627|1
A|Yeah.|b|2627|0
B|she, uh, she likes to, um, she doesn't like the beef dishes.|sd|2627|1
B|She likes the chicken and fish,|sd|2627|1
A|Uh, yeah.|b|2627|0
B|and, like I said, we always ate beef and, uh, pork,  you know, a lot,|sd|2627|1
A|Oh, yeah.|b|2627|0
B|so|%|2627|1
A|I know,|ba|2627|0
A|my husband did too|sd|2627|0
A|His parents are Austrian|sd|2627|0
A|and they, uh, always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table|sd|2627|0
B|Oh yeah,|b|2627|1
B|red meat, plenty of good red meat.|sv|2627|1
A|Yeah,|aa|2627|0
A|yeah,|aa|2627|0
A|yeah.|aa|2627|0
B|My dad could eat, a, a meal with out any vegetables at all.|sd|2627|1
A|Oh, my gosh.|ba|2627|0
B|And, uh, Susan's, you know, they had, you know meatless meals, you know.|sd|2627|1
A|Yeah,|b|2627|0
A|yeah.|b|2627|0
B|My dad wouldn't know what to do.|sd|2627|1
A|Oh, gosh,|ba|2627|0
A|so do you,|%|2627|0
B|Course, she grew up Catholic|sd|2627|1
B|so you know, they,  they sort of come with the,|%|2627|1
A|Oh, they did the,|%|2627|0
B|there's a certain amount of meatless meals you have to have|sv|2627|1
A|That you do,|aa|2627|0
A|right,|aa|2627|0
A|right,|aa|2627|0
A|that's just part of it.|sv|2627|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2627|1
A|Yeah,|b|2627|0
A|we didn't, my family didn't,|sd|2627|0
A|but when I got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that,|sd|2627|0
A|but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly,|sd|2627|0
A|he never,|%|2627|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2627|1
A|There was dishes that he really enjoyed, eating.|sd|2627|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2627|1
A|there were several things that he liked|sd|2627|0
A|but it never was really, something that he would have chosen.|sd|2627|0
A|It's just that I cooked|sd|2627|0
A|so he had to put up with it|sd|2627|0
B|Right.|b|2627|1
A|So, but there was one thing that he couldn't stand|sd|2627|0
A|and that was soybeans.|sd|2627|0
A|I tried it like once or twice|sd|2627|0
A|and he just could not eat it,|sd|2627|0
A|so I never,|%|2627|0
A|I had,|%|2627|0
A|I was limited.|sd|2627|0
A|I had to make vegetarian meals without using soy beans,|sd|2627|0
A|but.|%|2627|0
B|Yeah,|b|2627|1
B|it's hard to get a protein content up then|sv|2627|1
A|Yeah,|aa|2627|0
A|yeah.|aa|2627|0
A|That's true|aa|2627|0
B|Yeah,|b|2627|1
B|I like, I like them every now and then for a change,|sd|2627|1
B|it's nice.|sv|2627|1
A|Yeah,|aa|2627|0
A|some of the stuff is good,|sv|2627|0
A|but it just, it was a tremendous amount of cooking|sd|2627|0
A|Because you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure they're complete,|sv|2627|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2627|1
A|and we had little kids at the time, you know,|sd|2627|0
A|when I was home with them, and it, it was just so much cooking,|sd|2627|0
A|I couldn't, I don't like to cook.|sd|2627|0
A|And I'm not really that great at it|sd|2627|0
A|so it just turned out to be too much of a, too much, too much cooking.|sd|2627|0
A|So, well, I guess I'll let you get back to feeding your little one there.|ad|2627|0
B|No, uh,|ar|2627|1
B|he's all done.|sd|2627|1
A|He's set,|qy^d|2627|0
A|oh okay.|%|2627|0
B|Yeah,|ny|2627|1
B|yeah,|ny|2627|1
B|I set him down.|sd|2627|1
A|Okay.|bk|2627|0
A|Do you like to bake at all,|qy|2627|0
A|or do you, do you get into that's, that,|qrr|2627|0
B|Yeah,|ny|2627|1
B|we used to do that, um,|sd|2627|1
B|my mom, used to go crazy, every Sunday, until my dad like blew up, you know|sd|2627|1
A|Yeah|b|2627|0
B|after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the Navy, she stopped doing it.|sd|2627|1
B|But, um, she used to have, you know, two dozen sticky buns, three bread rolls, you know, every week.|sd|2627|1
A|Really,|b|2627|0
A|no kidding.|b|2627|0
B|And, um, the sticky buns, of course, would last, you know three or four days|sd|2627|1
B|and that would be it.|sd|2627|1
A|Yeah,|b|2627|0
A|then be gone.|b|2627|0
A|I know,|ba|2627|0
A|that's the thing about baking.|sv|2627|0
A|I used to, I, I don't mind baking at all|sd|2627|0
A|and I, I can do a pretty good pie,|sd|2627|0
A|we have this pie crust recipe in our family that my grandmother gave my mother|sd|2627|0
A|and my mother taught me how to make it.|sd|2627|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|2627|1
A|And, um, so I can make a pretty mean pie,|sd|2627|0
A|but, um, I don't do it anymore because it's just too fattening.|sv|2627|0
A|We had the same kind of problem.|sd|2627|0
A|If you make homemade bread,|sv|2627|0
B|Uh-huh|b|2627|1
A|I mean, it's supposed to save you money|sv|2627|0
A|but you eat like three times the amount of bread that you usually eat|sv|2627|0
A|It tastes so good.|sv|2627|0
B|Uh-huh,|aa|2627|1
B|we always, we had that bread that was, uh, um,|sd|2627|1
B|you ever seen the, the starter bread,|qy|2627|1
B|I can't remember what it's called,|sd|2627|1
B|they call it the, um, Amish bread here|sd|2627|1
B|but,|%|2627|1
A|Oh, uh, yeah.|ny|2627|0
B|uh, it's made with,|%|2627|1
B|you just leave it out,|sd|2627|1
A|Yeah.|b|2627|0
B|you know, and you let it spoil sort of.|sd|2627|1
A|Yeah,|ny|2627|0
A|uh-huh,|ny|2627|0
A|I've heard of that, I've heard of it,|sd|2627|0
A|but I've never done it.|sd|2627|0
B|You know, yeah.|b|2627|1
A|That sounds pretty good.|ba|2627|0
B|Yeah,|aa|2627|1
B|it tasted pretty good, really.|sd|2627|1
A|Yeah,|b|2627|0
A|oh yeah.|b|2627|0
B|But, uh, it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad|sd|2627|1
B|and then you add all these other ingredients to it,|sd|2627|1
B|but.|%|2627|1
A|Yeah,|b|2627|0
A|and then you you make the bread|sd|2627|0
A|but you pinch off a portion, or save a portion of it for the next time, or something.|sd|2627|0
B|Yeah|b|2627|1
B|right,|b|2627|1
B|you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else|sd|2627|1
B|and that's how they continue the thing.|sd|2627|1
A|Yeah,|b|2627|0
A|yeah,|b|2627|0
A|yeah.|b|2627|0
A|I know, it sounds, it always sounded,|%|2627|0
A|I don't know how safe that was|qh|2627|0
B|Yeah,|aa|2627|1
B|I know it sounded strange to me too,|sd|2627|1
B|I figure, well you're baking it|sv|2627|1
B|so, you know, yeah.|%|2627|1
A|Yeah|aa|2627|0
A|that's true,|aa|2627|0
A|that's, that's got to kill anything I guess,|sv|2627|0
A|but.|%|2627|0
