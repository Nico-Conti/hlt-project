B|So, let's talk about the, uh, wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order|sv|4372|0
B|and after the fact, the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it.|sd|4372|0
B|What do you think?|qo|4372|0
B|Is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there?|qy|4372|0
A|Well, actually, I don't think they're out of line.|ng|4372|1
A|Devil's advocate possibly,|h|4372|1
A|but it, you are trying to avoid paying taxes|sv|4372|1
A|and whether or not you agree with that law, you're still circumventing it.|sd|4372|1
A|You are legal in, in your circumvention of that law.|sd|4372|1
B|What, what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though?|qw|4372|0
B|I mean what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying, uh, income tax on something that you purchase mail order?|qw|4372|0
A|Really, I, I, I don't think that's a valid argument.|sv|4372|1
A|I think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax.|sv|4372|1
A|Um, naturally some, some things you just can't find in your local K-Mart or, or, uh, Bryn Mawr stereo dealer.|sd|4372|1
A|Uh, but then why not pay, pay the sales tax|qh|4372|1
A|Corporations have to,|sd|4372|1
A|why should an individual just because it's, just because the state can't really find out about it, be able to avoid paying sales tax?|qh|4372|1
B|Well, I mean, it seems to me that, generally, at least in my own experience, when I purchase something mail order, it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania.|sv|4372|0
B|It's because, I'm sorry, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.|sd|4372|0
A|Yes.|b|4372|1
B|Uh, it's because I, I can't find the item that I want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area.|sv|4372|0
B|So I go outside the area for that.|sd|4372|0
B|And I think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though, you know, the revenue stream went to another state.|sv|4372|0
B|I don't, I don't think that that's my responsibility as a, as a conscientious consumer.|sv|4372|0
A|I, I'll agree it, it's not your responsibility|aa|4372|1
A|but, is it also legal, for you to do that?|qh|4372|1
A|from what I understand from various net readings, it, the Federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes, uh, in, into place in the next few years.|sd|4372|1
A|It is, it is a lost revenue stream right now|sd|4372|1
A|and states can use all the revenue they can get.|sv|4372|1
A|With some, with something like that, do your arguments still apply?|qy|4372|1
B|Well, I think that if, if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then I don't argue with it.|no|4372|0
B|Because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh, I bought this out of state.|sv|4372|0
B|I need to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania.|^q|4372|0
A|Which is exactly what businesses do at the present.|sd|4372|1
B|Right.|aa|4372|0
B|But the point is is that businesses do that.|sv|4372|0
B|The business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question.|sd|4372|0
B|That's a cost of doing business.|sv|4372|0
B|The burden  shouldn't be placed on the consumer.|sv|4372|0
A|And I, I  I was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having, having to pay sales tax on it.|sd|4372|1
B|Uh.|%|4372|0
A|That's my understanding of the way, uh, the way it works.|sd|4372|1
A|Usually, the, the person ordering doesn't pay.|sd|4372|1
A|But the accounting department will, uh, suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay.|sd|4372|1
A|And there there are some substantial, nasty penalties, um, if you, if businesses try to avoid that.|sd|4372|1
B|Uh, do you mean businesses from the point of view as, of, of selling things to a consumer and  then being responsible for the sales tax? Or purchasing.|qy|4372|0
A|No.|nn|4372|1
A|Businesses, uh if purchasing things mail order,|sd|4372|1
A|if, if I'm a computer consulting firm and I see these, this great deal on forty-six mother boards, uh, from, from say Utah.|sd|4372|1
A|Um, I, I might buy the mother boards from Utah but then still have to pay Pennsylvania sales tax.|sd|4372|1
A|My accounting department will at the end of the month.|sd|4372|1
A|I think that I think that's the way things work in Pennsylvania.|sv|4372|1
A|And I know they work that way in, uh, say here in D C.|sd|4372|1
B|Yeah.|b|4372|0
B|See I'm unfamiliar with that because I don't, I never see that end of the business.|sd|4372|0
A|Yeah.|b|4372|1
B|So, my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer.|sd|4372|0
B|Uh, but, if that's the case, if the business is responsible for policing themselves, then I think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that, uh, the opportunity to forget that you owe sales tax for something, uh, can be avoided.|sv|4372|0
A|That's true.|aa|4372|1
A|a a big hole does exist right now, uh, in that consumers can just say oh, I, I forgot that.|sv|4372|1
A|There, there is no well defined mechanism at all|sd|4372|1
A|and, and that it is a a loss. I, I think is that the Federal government will try to establish a mechanism just to do just that in in order to gain the revenue that's being lost.|sv|4372|1
A|Uh, I mean, I, I don't know if I agree with that.|sd|4372|1
A|But it, but,|%|4372|1
