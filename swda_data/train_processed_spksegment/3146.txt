B|You know, I'm originally from Connecticut|sd|3146|1
B|and, uh, I was home a few years ago|sd|3146|1
B|and my sister and brother-in-law were going to take us out for dinner|sd|3146|1
B|and, uh, I was really amazed, you know,|sd|3146|1
B|the, the restaurants up there were kind of quaint.|sd|3146|1
B|You know, they were real, real pretty|sd|3146|1
B|but they lacked, the service|sd|3146|1
B|and they lacked the the, just the, I don't know.|sd|3146|1
B|The restaurants down here seem like they have, uh,|sd|3146|1
B|I guess there's so much competition that they, really have to be good.|sd|3146|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|3146|0
B|And, I thought I would really miss that.|sd|3146|1
A|I would, too,|aa|3146|0
A|because, well, because we don't go out very often.|sd|3146|0
A|When we do go out, um, in a way it's like a little mini vacation I guess,|sd|3146|0
A|and, uh, it is, it's a whole experience.|sd|3146|0
A|Of course you want the food to be good|sv|3146|0
A|but the atmosphere and service I think, are important, uh too.|sv|3146|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|3146|1
B|And, you know, in order to survive in this area I think they have to be good.|sv|3146|1
A|Yeah.|b|3146|0
B|Because the ones that aren't so good don't, just don't make it.|sd|3146|1
A|Um, that reminded me of a place for lunch that's a little off the beaten track|sd|3146|0
A|but it is wonderful.|sd|3146|0
A|It's called Cafe Max|sd|3146|0
A|and it's at Plano Road and Campbell.|sd|3146|0
