A|Yeah,|b|3231|0
A|well, it's amazing,|sv|3231|0
A|but really, I mean, when you stop and think about it, Anthony Perkins didn't have that big a role in the movie|sv|3231|0

A|Yeah,|aa|3231|0
A|I do too,|aa|3231|0
A|I really did|sd|3231|0
B|Yeah,|b|3231|1

A|that was really intriguing,|sv|3231|0
A|and it, it didn't scare me all that much, you know,|sd|3231|0
A|and I, I don't like to go to movies to be scared,|sd|3231|0
A|that's not why I go|sd|3231|0
