A|do you see as, uh, the changes that have occurred in the last ,|qy|3597|0
A|Beverly.|sd|3597|0
B|I think one of the thing that I notice a lot,|sv|3597|1
B|I know it's touching social changes,|sd|3597|1
B|but, uh, to me what becomes socially acceptable,|sd|3597|1
B|and I, I don't know if it's a factor of me growing older and seeing things through different eyes or if it's a factor of our society actually moving in that direction,|sd|3597|1
B|but I notice things on T V being more, um, open, more I believe, uh,|sv|3597|1
B|they portray things on T V obviously that they never would have years ago,|sd|3597|1
B|and, you know, and specifically, nudity, things like that, uh,|sd|3597|1
B|I don't know,|h|3597|1
B|I, I've said several times to my husband that I feel like gee, in ten years they'll have just full nudity on T V|sv|3597|1
B|and nobody will think anything of it,|sv|3597|1
B|and to me that's surprising.|sv|3597|1
B|To me, that's, that's a big change to accept it,|sv|3597|1
B|and it comes across, I think subtly, you know, a little at a time, to where you get so used to seeing a little change, that, you know, when they go one step further, you don't notice it that much.|sv|3597|1
B|That's one of the biggest ones I've seen.|sd|3597|1
A|Huh,|aa|3597|0
A|yeah,|aa|3597|0
A|that's a big one.|aa|3597|0
B|What about you?|qo|3597|1
A|Well, I think that society has come to a point where they're not responsible for any of their actions.|sv|3597|0
A|Somebody else, uh, made them do it.|sv|3597|0
A|Uh, that's what I seem to see a lot of, that, uh, no one is willing to take responsibility for their life and their choices.|sv|3597|0
A|It's rather, sue these guys because they made a uh, a seat belt that didn't work right|sv|3597|0
A|or uh, that's what I think is a big one.|sv|3597|0
B|Uh-huh.|b|3597|1
B|I tend to agree with you,|aa|3597|1
B|and I think there's a lot of that.|sv|3597|1
B|Um, yeah,|%|3597|1
B|we have become lawsuit happy.|sv|3597|1
B|Any little thing, it's like let's see what I can get.|sv|3597|1
B|Don't you think that maybe a lot of that came from, um, oh, you know, the, the, the era we went through that was like, you know, hey if it makes you happy, do it.|sv|3597|1
B|You know, kind of like, disregard to others,|sv|3597|1
B|do what makes you happy,|^q|3597|1
B|and, and yes,|%|3597|1
B|we should take care of ourselves, you know,|sv|3597|1
B|and we should see to our own lives, but not to a total disregard of others.|sv|3597|1
B|Um, I don't know,|h|3597|1
B|I think it's come to that a lot.|sv|3597|1
B|I see it a lot in my daughter.|sd|3597|1
B|I have a four year old.|sd|3597|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|3597|0
B|And hers isn't a social thing as much as it's a stage they go through,|sd|3597|1
B|but whenever something happens it's, you made me hit that,|sd|3597|1
B|you made me do this,|^q|3597|1
B|and so I try to tell her, , everything isn't always somebody else's fault.|sd|3597|1
B|You know, you have to watch where you're going|sv|3597|1
B|and and so it's what you just said, kind of hits home to me, just through her.|sd|3597|1
A|Sure.|b|3597|0
A|Yeah,|b|3597|0
A|and, another thing I think has changed quite a bit is, uh, the roles that men and women play.|sv|3597|0
A|That's really in the last thirty years has changed significantly.|sd|3597|0
B|Um, in your opinion, good or bad, or both?|qy|3597|1
A|Well, both, you know,|sd|3597|0
A|there's some great things that, uh, have come about with more equality,|sd|3597|0
A|but I think that also,|sv|3597|0
A|I don't know what's causing society to have so many broken families and things like that, because I think that's bad for us.|sv|3597|0
B|I do too.|aa|3597|1
B|I think part of that,|sv|3597|1
B|I don't know,|h|3597|1
B|I think the role of women changing has been good in that women are feeling like, in terms of their self confidence, their self worth, you know, I can do something,|sv|3597|1
B|I can be somebody, you know,|^q|3597|1
B|if I put my mind to it, I can accomplish things too.|^q|3597|1
B|And I think that's good,|sv|3597|1
B|but, um, I think when you push, you know, maybe I think when that was first trying come about with, you know, what we know as the women's lib movement|sv|3597|1
A|Uh-huh.|b|3597|0
B|I think it was too extreme.|sv|3597|1
B|Um, I think you can be feminine and still be all those other things too, you know,|sv|3597|1
B|and I think there's definite roles,|sv|3597|1
B|and I think, you know, part of the break up of the family, maybe it's because of the, the, the social changes,|sv|3597|1
B|I don't know,|h|3597|1
B|the fact that, uh, during their early changes where, you know, women did come more, speak, maybe speak out, I was going to say, come more out of themselves,|sv|3597|1
B|but speak out,|sv|3597|1
B|I think a lot of men were threatened by that.|sv|3597|1
B|I think now less men are, you know, because they're used to it,|sv|3597|1
B|it's around them.|sv|3597|1
B|Um, but I, I don't know,|h|3597|1
B|I, I, I don't know why the families are breaking up.|sd|3597|1
B|I think that may go back to what you said a minute ago about people not being responsible for themselves or their actions, because it's like they don't go into the marriage with a commitment that this is going to work.|sv|3597|1
B|They go in and say, well, hey, you know, I'll stick with it while it's good,|sd|3597|1
B|and then I'll get out.|^q|3597|1
B|And I, I, I think that directly affects the effort that you put into that marriage or that commitment.|sv|3597|1
A|Yeah,|aa|3597|0
A|I would agree with you.|aa|3597|0
A|Uh,|%|3597|0
